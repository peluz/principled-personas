"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet uses some for her own consumption and baking:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs each day is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session:
   - James runs 3 sprints in one session.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance for one session is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters.

2. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Each session is 180 meters.
   - Therefore, the total distance for the week is \(3 \times 180 = 540\) meters.

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second glass:
\[ \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times \$5 = \$3 \]

This pattern continues, with every first glass costing $5 and every second glass costing $3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses.

The cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pair} = \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Distance to Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles (30 mph) + 120 miles (80 mph) = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled on the return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

The total number of downloads over the three months is \( \boxed{366} \)."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Donuts:**

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90. We set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Net profit per year} \times \text{Number of years} = \text{Initial cost}
   \]
   \[
   \$7.5 \times \text{Number of years} = \$90
   \]
   Solving for the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we determine the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the final values:
- Final value of jewelry: $5,125
- Final value of electronic gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to sum the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances each day, the total distance covered by each train over the two days is the sum of the distances traveled each day.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance traveled westward} + \text{Distance traveled northward}
\]

\[
\text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:

\[

3. **Total Annual Salary:**
   - Sum of teaching and coaching earnings
   \[
   35000 + 22500 = 57500
   \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are:
\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since she makes a 3 egg omelet each day, the total number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks is:
\[ 28 \times 3 = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{84}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns.
2. Determine how much the candle melts in that time.

First, let's find the total time the candle burns. The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The difference in time is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \( \boxed{26} \)."

First, calculate the distance from the end of the trip to the second stop:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means the second stop was at the 45-mile mark. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (at 20 miles) and the second stop (at 45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses from Gunter's friends:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for one dog.
2. Calculate the daily care time for all 10 dogs.
3. Calculate the weekly care time for all 10 dogs.

Step 1: Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.

Step 2: Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5 \]

Substituting the number of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 \]

Substituting the number of Aaron's jewels:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"First, we determine how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first 20 minutes. Since he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we add the points scored in both halves of the game to find the total points scored:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by adding the cost of the video games and the remaining money:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \]

Since the money he got from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165, we can check the calculation:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \]

This $30 is the amount of money he should have left, but the problem states he has $5 left. This discrepancy suggests a need to recheck the problem's conditions, but based on the given information and the logical steps, the number of lego sets he sold is 13, and the problem does not indicate he has any lego sets left unsold.

Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

Thus, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance covered while running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance covered while walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone:**

   - Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the throwing distance of the gold javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, her throwing distance is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from Polly's throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units is:
     \[
     15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is:
     \[
     120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units}
     \]

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is **30**."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back, we need to know the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since the problem does not specify the distance, we can denote the distance as \(D\) miles.

First, we calculate the distance \(D\):
- Tom's ship travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours.
- His speed during this time is 10 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance \(D\) is:
  \[
  D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 miles per hour:
- The distance to be traveled back is 30 miles.
- His speed on the return trip is 6 miles per hour.
- The time \(T\) it takes to travel back is:
  \[
  T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Thus, the time it takes Tom to get back is \(\boxed{5}\) hours."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue earned on Thursday:

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday:

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Since no truck tires are repaired, the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The higher revenue day is Thursday, with $520, and Friday, with $480. The difference in revenue is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of adopted kittens the sisters are driving home.
2. Calculate the number of kittens born to Patchy.
3. Add the number of kittens born to Trixie.
4. Sum all the kittens together.

First, the number of adopted kittens is given as 7.

Next, we calculate the number of kittens born to Patchy. According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, the number of kittens born to Patchy is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Then, we know that Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, we sum all the kittens together:
\[ 7 \text{ (adopted kittens)} + 21 \text{ (kittens from Patchy)} + 12 \text{ (kittens from Trixie)} = 40 \]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:

- Each cluster has 20 raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, add the number of individual raspberries:
- There are 67 individual raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries on the bush is:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we need to account for the total number of oranges and subtract the ones that are not good.

1. **Total number of oranges**: 25
2. **Number of bad oranges**: 1
3. **Number of unripe oranges**: 20% of 25
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5
   \]
4. **Number of sour oranges**: 2

Now, we sum up the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
\[
1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8
\]

Finally, we subtract this sum from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
25 - 8 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of good oranges is \(\boxed{17}\)."

\[ \text{Cost of insurance} = 10\% \times \$1300 = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost of materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the standard annual pension for the first 20 years:**
   - Marcy receives $50,000 per year for the first 20 years.

2. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension after 20 years is $50,000 (the standard annual pension).

3. **Calculate 5% of the pension value:**
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]

4. **Add the additional pension to the standard annual pension:**
   - The standard annual pension is $50,000.
   - The additional pension is $2,500.
   - Therefore, the total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:

"Let's define the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur will eat 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad required:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Calculate the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age = \( A \)
   - Jackson's age = \( J \)
   - Corey's age = \( C \)
   - James's age = 10

2. According to the problem, James is 1 year younger than Corey:
   \[
   C = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson:
   \[
   A = J + 5
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( A \) we found:
   \[
   9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his diet improved his speed by 10%. If his speed improved by 10%, his time to run the 400-meter hurdles would decrease by 10%. Therefore, we calculate 10% of his original time and subtract it from his original time:

\[ \text{Decrease in time} = 10\% \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 4 \text{ seconds} \]

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{Decrease in time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is:
     \[
     2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is:
     \[
     60 + 120 = 180
     \]

3. **Determine the number of rabbit pets:**
   - The number of rabbit pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbit pets is:
     \[
     180 - 12 = 168
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[
     60 + 120 + 168 = 348
     \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

We are told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of sauce produced from one can is half the volume of the can.

2. **Calculate the volume of sauce per can**: Since each can is 16 ounces and it loses half its volume, the volume of sauce produced from one can is:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ ounces}}{2} = 8 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cans used**: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of sauce by the volume of sauce produced per can:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of tomatoes used**: Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we add the 18 new potted plants she received to her existing 80 plants:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Then, we subtract the 40 plants she will give away from the total of 98 plants:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 5 weekdays, he drinks \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - However, he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 2 weekend days, he drinks \(4 \times 2 = 8\) glasses of water.

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, we get \(20 + 8 = 28\) glasses of water.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles of the city. We do this by multiplying the time per mile by the total number of miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then find its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Since the total parts of the mixture is 20, each part of the mixture corresponds to \(\frac{120}{20} = 6\) teaspoons.

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts of the total mixture, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

   \]

Therefore, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"First, we calculate the number of vehicles already at the port from the initial count. There were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later is 40% more than his salary four years ago.
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary four years later is \( 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years later is 40% more than her salary four years ago.
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

"Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours each day. For both days, that's \(6 + 6 = 12\) hours.
3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**: She slept 1 hour more than she did on Tuesday and Wednesday, so she slept \(6 + 1 = 7\) hours each day. For four days, that's \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

Now, we add up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 12 hours
- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 28 hours

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on her speed changes.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours

   Distance covered in the first segment:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Time: Total time - Time in the first segment = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

   Distance covered in the second segment:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of distances from both segments:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 50 \]

Next, we are told that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, the number of friends Amy has is:
\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

To find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = 50 + 70 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost based on the quantities Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   - Given: Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

3. **Cost of an Orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- Cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each: \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
- Cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each: \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)
- Cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the subtotal:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we calculate the 20% delivery fee on the subtotal:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal gives the total before the tip:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars = 20
2. Number of automatic cars = 12
3. Number of manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the previous 12 hours (30 + 60) minus the bees that returned in the first 12 hours (15) plus the bees that left in the last 6 hours (60) minus the bees that had already returned in the first 12 hours (15).

So, the total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees} \]

The number of bees that returned in the first 12 hours is:
\[ 15 \text{ bees} \]

The number of bees that left in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ bees} \]

The number of bees that had already returned in the first 12 hours is:

- Therefore, the total cost for one adult ticket and one child ticket is:
  \[
  12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. To find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the change to the total cost of the tickets:
\[
22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Difference in time: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles, each bike has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles, each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to get the total weekly hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}
\]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - There are 300 rolls.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 4 \text{ inches} = \frac{4}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet} \).
   - Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - There are 120 croissants.
   - Convert inches to feet: \( 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ feet} \).
   - Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ feet} \).

Now, add the total lengths of all the baked goods:

\[
100 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} + 120 \text{ feet} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then double that amount since the bananas are ordered every 2 months.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ bananas (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ bananas (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ bananas (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. Since Blake runs farther, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Thus, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6. So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 11 + 6 = 17 \]

Then, 2 of the tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles he can see now is:

\[ 17 - 2 = 15 \]

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine the water depth in the tank on Wednesday, we need to follow the changes in depth step by step.

1. **Initial Depth on Monday:**
   The tank has a depth of 17 feet on Monday.

2. **Depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."

\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Express the price increase as a multiplier:**
   - A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \) every two months.

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - \( \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \)

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   - The price after \( n \) periods is given by \( P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n \).

5. **Substitute the values:**
   - \( P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)

6. **Compute the value of \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator, \( (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \).

7. **Calculate the final price:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total additional cost = €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Next, we add this total to the cost of the computer:
Total cost = €1090 + €333 = €1423

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
Money left = €1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

The total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{49}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

**Step 3: Convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 4: Add the total time for peeling and cutting.**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total time to prep all potatoes = \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}

"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be their total cost.
   - Profit is calculated as: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C

   - Rearrange to find the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars per gallon}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( G \) gallons is:
     \[
     C = 5G
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue in terms of \( G \):**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars per gallon}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total revenue for \( G \) gallons is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 10G
     \]

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \( G \):**
   - Substitute the expressions for total revenue and total cost into the profit equation:
     \[
     10G = 5G + 25
     \]
   - Subtract \( 5G \) from both sides:
     \[
     5G = 25
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     G = 5
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost on lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost on lemons for 5 gallons is:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel, and then determine how much he has left after these expenses.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   - Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to establish the relationship between the quantities of different flowers Sandra ordered.

1. Let the number of white carnations be \( W \).
2. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of pink calla lilies is \( 5W \). We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5W = 200
   \]
3. Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
4. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
   \[
   4W = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Thus, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"First, let's define the variables and use the information given in the problem to set up equations.

Let:
- \( J \) be Jean's current age.
- \( M \) be Mark's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Therefore, half of Jan's age two years ago was:
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]
   Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \). According to the problem, this was 5 years older than 14:
   \[
   M - 2 = 14 + 5
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   M - 2 = 19
   \]
   Solving for \( M \):
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

Now, using the first equation \( J = M + 2 \):
\[
J = 21 + 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
\[
\text{Total time for the faster team} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
- Third runner: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
- Fourth runner: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

\[
\text{Total time for the slower team} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Let's add these times step by step:
\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

\[
\text{Total time for the slower team} = 222 \text{ seconds}

**Difference in Time:**
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
Now, we find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage
To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the number of bags the trader sold is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out on the yard.
   - Now, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   To find the total number of cards Elaine has now, we sum the initial number of cards and the cards collected each month.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences, Publisher B pays:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the payments from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate the cheese usage for each part.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches} = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
   - Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:
     \[
     8 \text{ slices}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
\[
14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. Since each bag of blue pens contains 9 pens and she bought 6 bags, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since each bag of red pens contains 6 pens and she bought 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together. Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens, the total number of pens is:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of tests and the desired average:**
   - Mr. Bert gives 6 tests.
   - Brinley wants an average of 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. **Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The total score after including the sixth test will be:**
   \[
   438 + x
   \]

5. **Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average. The lowest score among 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 is 71.**

6. **Remove the lowest score (71) and calculate the new total score:**
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]

7. **Add the sixth test score \( x \) to the new total score:**
   \[
   367 + x
   \]

8. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[
125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 120 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for three weeks:
\[
120 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Total Kilometers:**
Add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[
500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal did is:
\[
\boxed{860}
\]"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the weight of each candied apple:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
   - Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:**
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the candied apples:**
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Each candied apple weighs 20 grams.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the bag of candy:**
   - The total weight is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples.
   - Therefore, the total weight is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{2600}\) grams."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Number of cakes on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Number of cakes on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Now, we sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one dozen cups be \( C \).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 20C \).

3. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     20C = 6000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   20C = 4800
   \]

5. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   C = \frac{4800}{20} = 240
   \]

6. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - Since \( C \) is the cost of one dozen cups, the cost of one cup is:
     \[
     \frac{C}{12} = \frac{240}{12} = 20
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.
- Sara already has $10 saved, so her total savings before mowing the lawn are \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

We need to find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. The equation for her total money is:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \).

To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This confirms our solution is correct.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
   - The second day had 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - This can be expressed as the sum of the customers from each day: \(100 + 150 + x = 500\).

5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate the points scored by Yuri:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate the points scored by Brianna:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is:
  \[
  10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is:
  \[
  5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after watering the garden and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated as follows:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, Andy plants 50 petunias. Now, to find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year. To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Carlos is:
  \[
  30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the total cost for Benji is:
  \[
  18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji:
\[
90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the travel time by car is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the days taken for each leg of the trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the individual costs:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract this from the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, their combined rate is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps and calculate the number of watermelons at each stage.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 
   - 30% of 120 watermelons are ready.
   - Calculation: \( 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**:
   - Total watermelons - watermelons ready for harvest = remaining watermelons.
   - Calculation: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons.

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**:
   - 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**:
   - Total remaining watermelons - watermelons ready for harvest = remaining watermelons.
   - Calculation: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \) watermelons.

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is **21**."
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for each car.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \text{ cars} \times \$20,000 \text{ per car} = \$240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 10\% \text{ of } \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total registration fee:**
   \[
   \text{Registration fee per car} = \$1,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total registration fee} = 12 \text{ cars} \times \$1,000 \text{ per car} = \$12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost including tax and registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[
\boxed{276000}

"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This means she collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of ants
Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens. These 25 pens are full and can be used to make new pens when their ink runs low.

2. **First Cycle:**
   - When the ink in these 25 pens runs low, Ram can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 full pens and 1 empty pen.

3. **Second Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 21 full pens and 1 empty pen. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make another new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 21 - 5 + 1 = 17 full pens and 1 empty pen.

4. **Third Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 17 full pens and 1 empty pen. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make another new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 17 - 5 + 1 = 13 full pens and 1 empty pen.

5. **Fourth Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 13 full pens and 1 empty pen. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make another new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 13 - 5 + 1 = 9 full pens and 1 empty pen.

6. **Fifth Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 9 full pens and 1 empty pen. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make another new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 9 - 5 + 1 = 5 full pens and 1 empty pen.

7. **Sixth Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 5 full pens and 1 empty pen. He can mix the ink from these 5 pens to make another new full pen.
   - After making 1 new pen, he will have 5 - 5 + 1 = 1 full pen and 1 empty pen.

8. **Seventh Cycle:**
   - Now, Ram has 1 full pen and 1 empty pen. He cannot make another new pen because he needs 5 empty pens to do so.

Adding up all the full pens Ram has after each cycle, we get:
25 (initial pens) + 5 (first cycle) + 5 (second cycle) + 5 (third cycle) + 5 (fourth cycle) + 5 (fifth cycle) + 1 (sixth cycle) = 46 pens.

Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{46}\)."

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. Determine the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280
   \]

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so the difference is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has two books. If Dolly reads her own two books and also reads Pandora's one book, she will read a total of:
   \[
   2 \text{ (her own books)} + 1 \text{ (Pandora's book)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

2. Pandora has one book. If Pandora reads her own book and also reads Dolly's two books, she will read a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (her own book)} + 2 \text{ (Dolly's books)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

3. To find the total number of books read collectively by both Dolly and Pandora, we add the number of books each of them reads:
   \[
   3 \text{ (Dolly's total)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's total)} = 6 \text{ books}

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week}\]

Since Mike has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:

\[3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week}\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing 30 pages, we multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to write each page:

\[30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{3}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day over 30 days:

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has \(\boxed{250}\) minutes left."

   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]

   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Therefore, \( 52 = J_a + 8 \).
   - Solving for \( J_a \), we get \( J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \).

2. **Determine the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
   - Therefore, \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).
   - Substituting \( J_a = 44 \), we get \( J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \).

3. **Determine the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Let \( A_b \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
   - Therefore, \( A_b = \frac{J_b}{2} \).
   - Substituting \( J_b = 48 \), we get \( A_b = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.
   - Total number of fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas.
   - Total number of fruits = \( 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \).

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - Total number of fruits = \( 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days and then find out how much flour is required for that total number of cookies.

1. Calculate the total number of cookies:
   \[
   36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300. To find two-thirds of this amount, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two-thirds of the cup. Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is:

"To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken is 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**

"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we have:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old."

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by all three.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Next, we add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person:
- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the 76-star flag, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of stars (76) to find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows.
3. Divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows.

Let's start with step 1:
- The three rows of 8 stars contain \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- The two rows of 6 stars contain \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.
- Therefore, the total number of stars in these five rows is \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

Next, step 2:
- Subtract the 36 stars from the total 76 stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars.

Finally, step 3:
- Divide the 40 stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows: \(40 \div 5 = 8\).

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of trucks needed:**
   Since each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. The formula to calculate time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane travels at 30 miles per hour and covers the same distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to travel this distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike's total points: 22
- Jim's total points: 18
- Tony's total points: 43

Adding these together gives:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's break down the activities Darren does on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids, starting from the opening bid and increasing by $50 each time she bids.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Opening bid: $200

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - Each of the 3 other people bids once. Since the bids increase by $50 each time, the bids by the other participants are:
     - First other participant: $200 + $50 = $250
     - Second other participant: $250 + $50 = $300
     - Third other participant: $300 + $50 = $350

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants. Therefore, her bids are:
     - After the first other participant: $350 + $50 = $400
     - After the second other participant: $400 + $50 = $450
     - After the third other participant: $450 + $50 = $500

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost of the desk is the final bid Carmen makes, which is $500.

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{500}\) dollars."
"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Mileage and Cost:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so a round trip is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles.
   - He goes to work 5 days a week, so the weekly mileage is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so the yearly mileage is \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.
   - The cost per mile is $2, so the yearly cost for mileage is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

2. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the yearly bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the yearly cost for mileage and the yearly bonus, we get \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is \(\boxed{31800}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, on Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. So, we need to calculate twice the combined time of Monday and Sunday:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires four pages per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold each year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current (third) year.
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Total books sold = Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the second year + Books sold in the third year.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year.
   - Total books sold = \( 90 + y + 45 \).

3. **Determine the total number of books initially available:**
   - Initially, Elise had 250 books.
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of books sold:**
   \[
   90 + y + 45 = 200
   \]

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   135 + y = 200
   \]
   \[
   y = 200 - 135
   \]
   \[
   y = 65
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \( 65 \times 20 = 1300 \).

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled a total of 20 people, the number of people he lost to is the total number of people minus the number of people he beat:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, the total weight Sandy will lose in 4 weeks is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings per packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

**Final numerical answer:**
6"
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms grown:**
   - Extra arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs grown:**
   - Extra legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8
     \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the suits, suitcases, and gifts is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket to find out how much he has already spent:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 2000 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total amount spent on suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 2000 = 2000 \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

**Final Answer: 91**"
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

This means 2 people couldn't come due to previous commitments. Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet with a depth of 5 feet.
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot.
   - The total cost \( C \) is given by the formula:
     \[
     C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot}
     \]
   - Substituting the volume and the cost per cubic foot:
     \[
     C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together:

\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Assuming each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we need to find out how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   - Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
   - The number of ice cubes required is \( \frac{65}{13} = 5 \) ice cubes.

2. **Effect on Coffee Strength from Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   - With 5 ice cubes, the coffee becomes \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) milliliters weaker.

3. **Effect from Added Cream:**
   - Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.
   - The cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total Weakening:**
   - The total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   - Total weakening = 60 milliliters (from ice cubes) + 15 milliliters (from cream) = 75 milliliters.

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we need to determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[
\text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Now, we can calculate the total monthly payment to all the junior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Similarly, we can calculate the total monthly payment to all the senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to the junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial Lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends:**
   Oscar passes 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]

5. **Lollipops Eaten Later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning. So, he eats a total of:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]
   Subtracting these from the total:
   \[
   36 - 5 = 31
   \]

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge each percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

\[ \text{Amount taken off by the coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount the customer paid after applying the reward and the coupon:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income before tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

So, if they share the guns equally, each of them would have \(\boxed{6}\) guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the number of cows:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."

2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is in 4 weeks, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle at the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]
\[ 4 \text{ (remaining balls)} - 1 \text{ (lost ball)} = 3 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
2. **Blue Beetle**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
3. **Green Toad**: The same as the pink frog, so 50 pounds.
4. **Yellow Snake**: 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
5. **Red Bird**: 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- **Pink Frog**: 50 pounds
- **Blue Beetle**: 50 pounds
- **Green Toad**: 50 pounds
- **Yellow Snake**: 60 pounds
- **Red Bird**: 30 pounds

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for food is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for treats is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year (12 months), the cost for medicine is \( 100 \times 12 = 1200 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the yearly costs:
\[ 1200 \text{ (food)} + 240 \text{ (treats)} + 1200 \text{ (medicine)} = 2640 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year is **2640 dollars**."

"First, let's determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses. Since the school asked for twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Andrea had initially.

   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spends half the time he spends boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings to the money she earns from both jobs:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of each tree step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. First, we find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
   \[
   2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and friends} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the cost of \( x \) pounds of candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars.
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money and spends it on gumballs.
   - The cost of gumballs is $0.05 each.
   - He bought 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, half of his remaining money is $2, which means his remaining money before buying gumballs is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.
   - So, \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver just turned 45 years old, and this age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[

"First, let's determine the total number of socks Lindsay has washed. Since 1 pair of socks consists of 2 socks, washing 10 pairs means she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks from pairs. Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is:

\[20 + 15 = 35\]

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is:

\[50 - 35 = 15\]

So, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine how many cookies Rachel has left, we need to follow these steps:

2. Janet gave her 42 cookies. So, the total number of cookies Rachel has now is:
   \[
   23 + 42 = 65
   \]
3. Her brother ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is:
   \[
   65 - 44 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

Next, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance hiked by Cho:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance hiked by Chloe:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance hiked by Cho} - \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the number of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- The total number of silver pesos they have together is \(50 + 100 = 150\).
- The total number of gold pesos they have together is \(80 + 120 = 200\).

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total number of pesos.

- The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her total cost is $18. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to determine how many hours it takes her to sell all 36 cups. The number of hours required to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The number of boys is also 26. The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Adding these together step-by-step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: \$30.
- Dasha's total cost with individual tickets: \$36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[
\$36 - \$30 = \$6
\]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of the other two services:
\[ 10 + 24 = 34 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 per month. By switching to the streaming services, his monthly cost is $34. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable subscription is:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The new daily energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of Corns Initially:**
   According to the problem, there is twice as much corn as cannolis. Therefore, the number of corns initially is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

3. **Additional Cannolis:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

4. **Additional Corns:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns}
   \]
   Therefore, the new total number of corns is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   100 \text{ cannolis} + 100 \text{ corns} = 200
   \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott needs to walk in a day:**
   \[
   10,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

2. **Determine the steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school:
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
     \]
   - He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend:
     \[
     5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

3. **Determine the steps remaining after his jog:**
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take:
     \[
     10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

4. **Calculate the steps taken during his jog:**
   - The steps taken during his jog can be found by subtracting the steps he had already taken from the total steps he had before his jog:
     \[
     8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
     \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment per employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in June: \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - Total payment for May: 24000 dollars
   - Total payment for June: 18000 dollars
   - Total payment for both months: \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **42000** dollars."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so for 4 magnets, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted price of the fireworks gives:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. Instead, it gives us two separate pieces of information:

1. 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
2. The candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles do explode.

Given that the problem does not specify the percentage of candles that are ""more dangerous"" or the overlap between the two defects, we can assume that the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that could potentially explode. Since the problem does not provide a specific overlap percentage, we can assume that the 5% that smell like wet dog are a part of the 1% that explode.

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that explode: \(50000 \times 0.01 = 500\).
2. Calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog: \(50000 \times 0.05 = 2500\).

Since the problem implies that the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that explode, we can assume that all candles that smell like wet dog are included in the 1% that explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 2500.

However, if we strictly follow the problem's implication that the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that explode, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode would be the minimum of the two percentages applied to the total number of candles.

Given the problem's structure and the lack of additional information, the most logical and direct answer, assuming the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that explode, is:

\[
\boxed{2500}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picks.

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. A 30% discount means the price is reduced by 30%, so the customer pays 70% of the original price.

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times (1 - 0.30) = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet and landed 4,000 feet below that elevation. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Sum the amounts from both banks and add this to his initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. The total number of cats carried away by the boats is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these from the initial number of cats:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these from the remaining cats:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{256}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \). We know:
\[ T = 28 \]
\[ J = 22 \]

The sale price of the tattered jeans is \( T - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22 \) and the sale price of the jogger jeans is \( J - 6 = 22 - 6 = 16 \).

The total amount saved is the difference between the original prices and the sale prices:
\[ (T - \text{sale price of tattered jeans}) + (J - \text{sale price of jogger jeans}) = (28 - 22) + (22 - 16) = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

However, the problem states that he saved a total of $6. This means the $6 saved from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans must add up to $6. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_J \) and from the tattered jeans as \( S_T \). We know:
\[ S_J + S_T = 6 \]
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_T = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price:
\[ S_J = J - \text{sale price of jogger jeans} = 22 - 16 = 6 \]

But since the problem states he saved $2 from the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans must be:
\[ J = 16 + 2 = 18 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28. Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is $18. The difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 18 = 10 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - She buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Determine the bird attraction of each type of feeder:**
   - Store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each.
   - Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   - Therefore, homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - There are 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   - There are 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.
   - Total birds from homemade feeders = 3 × 30 = 90 birds.

5. **Sum the total number of birds attracted by all feeders:**
   - Total birds = Birds from store-bought feeders + Birds from homemade feeders
   - Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
   \[
   5 + 4 + 2 = 11
   \]

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket and have $50 in spending cash:**
   \[
   \text{Total money needed} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

2. **Determine how much money Kenny makes from selling each card:**
   \[
   \text{Price per card} = \$1.5
   \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny started with. He keeps \(\frac{1}{3}\) of them, so he sells \(\frac{2}{3}\) of them.**
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{2}{3}x
   \]

4. **Calculate the total money made from selling the cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times \$1.5
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total money made:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times \$1.5 = \$150
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 150
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}x = 150
   \]
   \[
   1x = 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 150 \times \frac{3}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 150 \times \frac{3}{2}

Therefore, Kenny started with \(\boxed{225}\) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests would each have 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests would each have 1 hotdog, so the caterer prepared an additional 18 hotdogs for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Determine the number of hotdogs consumed:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - The first hotdog for each of the 40 guests is already covered by the 54 hotdogs.
   - For the second hotdog, 40 guests would need 40 hotdogs.
   - Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs initially, and 40 guests need 40 more hotdogs, the number of hotdogs left after the first round of consumption is \( 54 - 40 = 14 \) hotdogs.
   - These 14 hotdogs are not enough for the remaining 40 - 14 = 26 guests to have a second hotdog.

3. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Since 14 hotdogs are left, only 14 guests can have a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 14 = 26 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 to this number gives:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we calculate how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gas each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

The weight of the cake consumed by Rory and her mom is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} \times 20 \text{ ounces} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes, or simply 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 1 minute before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

     \]

2. **Determine the width of the room:**
   - The area of the room is given as 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. Let \( w \) be the width in feet. Then:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \implies 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times w
     \]
   - Solving for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
     \]

The perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."

"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- For the first part of the trip, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours:
  \[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour:
  \[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards of the three colors to find the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies come from the east and join the fairies that were already there. Half of 50 is 25, so 25 more fairies joined the 50 that were already seen, making the total:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Subtracting these 30 fairies from the 75 that were there gives:

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles. She recycles five plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings from recycling both cans and bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find her total earnings over a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. **Starting Position:** Finley started in 1st place.
2. **First Change:** She fell back 5 spots.
   - \(1 - 5 = -4\)
   - Since a position can't be negative, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she falls back 5 spots from 1st, she is now in 6th place).
3. **Second Change:** She moved ahead 2 spots.
   - \(6 + 2 = 8\)
   - So, she is now in 8th place.
4. **Third Change:** She fell behind 3 spots.
   - \(8 - 3 = 5\)
   - So, she is now in 5th place.
5. **Fourth Change:** She jumped ahead 1 spot.

"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:

1. **Initial number of shoes:**
   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday:**
   He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives:
   \[
   5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his initial count:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he receives:
   \[
   15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long. Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- The total number of kids in the class is 32.

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to either or both from the total number of kids in the class:
\[
32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. 

To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:

   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader since she is at the top and the question does not specify adding the heights of multiple cheerleaders to form the total height of the pyramid.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. Since she works 8 hours a day, she walks \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes each day. Over 5 days, she walks \(40 \times 5 = 200\) minutes.

Therefore, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

According to the problem, in four years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 6 \, \text{dollars/ride} \times 14 \, \text{rides} = 84 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 2 \, \text{dollars/ride} \times 14 \, \text{rides} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both the morning and afternoon rides:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 84 \, \text{dollars} + 28 \, \text{dollars} = 112 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To determine how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie requires three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To verify, we check the total:
\[ L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total number of yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we need to calculate the amount each used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}
\]"

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple.

We know the following:
- The cost of one pack of grape gum is $2.
- The cost of one pack of green apple gum is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks). Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20. Therefore, the savings by buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:

\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July (up to July 19th): 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, which can be written as:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \)."

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each individual:

1. **Tony's rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. **Bobby's rate**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby's rate is:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
3. **Kathy's rate**: Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy's rate is:
   \[

     12 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]
   - There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly cost is:
     \[
     84 \text{ kWh/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 126 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   - The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily.
   - Therefore, her new daily consumption is:
     \[
     12 \text{ kWh/day} + 2 \text{ kWh/day} = 14 \text{ kWh/day}
     \]

5. **New Weekly Consumption:**
   - Her new weekly consumption is:
     \[
     14 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ kWh/week}
     \]

6. **New Weekly Cost:**
   - The cost per kilowatt-hour is still $1.50, so her new weekly cost is:
     \[
     98 \text{ kWh/week} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/kWh} = 147 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

Finally, let's find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills.

7. **Difference in Weekly Cost:**
   - The difference is:
     \[
     147 \text{ dollars/week} - 126 \text{ dollars/week} = 21 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

Thus, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate is:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
2. Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
3. Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
4. Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \). Substituting \( O_s = 20 \) into this equation, we get \( 20 = O_c - 2 \). Solving for \( O_c \), we get \( O_c = 22 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3 \times O_c = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( J_s = J_c - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have. The total number of sofas is \( O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \). The total number of chairs is \( O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \). Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount available}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

However, we need to determine how many more CDs he could have bought compared to the one he actually bought. Since he bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Additional CDs} = 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. **Weeks with 4 hours of workout:**
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours and 6 hours.
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks and 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.
   - Total hours for these 5 weeks: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Weeks with 5 hours of workout:**
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
   - Total hours for these 2 weeks: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. **Week with 6 hours of workout:**
   - He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Total hours for this 1 week: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers on the bus:**
   \[
   48
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[
\text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
\]

Next, determine the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[
\text{Total cost of the computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800
\]

Subtract this total from the overall cost to find the combined cost of the 2 monitors:
\[
\text{Total cost of the 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600
\]

Finally, calculate the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[
\text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
\]

Thus, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought, which is given as 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought. According to the problem, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by a boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \) and the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \).

Given:
\[ B = 60 \]

The number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ G = B + 4B \]

Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, the daily savings in the first half of April is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half of April is twice that of the first half, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
4.50 \, (\text{apples}) + 4.00 \, (\text{oranges}) + 4.50 \, (\text{peaches}) = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00

Therefore, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: the commission from the first $1000 in sales and the commission from the sales over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission from the first $1000 in sales:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission from the first $1000 = \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the commission from the sales over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \) dollars.
   - Commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission from the sales over $1000 = \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from the first $1000 + Commission from the sales over $1000.
   - Total commission = \( 300 + 150 = 450 \) dollars.

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim a mile in cold water, we can calculate the time it takes in warm water as follows:

\[ \text{Time in warm water for 1 mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. We start by calculating the total time for 3 miles in both conditions.

For cold water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ \text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Ray takes \(\boxed{54}\) minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"To determine the total cost of lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
   So, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs $120.

3. To find the total cost of lunch, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

Thus, the total cost for lunch today is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of buttons that have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes, the remaining buttons have four holes. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 buttons with four holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:

\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:

\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]"

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker, which is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half of the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \(\boxed{16}\) cups."
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then sum them up.

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given:

1. Mark's weight is 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):
\[
\frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle**: The initial angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.

2. **Rate of Movement**: The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.

3. **Total Movement**: Over 10 hours, the sun will move:
   \[
   5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the total movement:
   \[
   32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"First, let's calculate the total reading time in the first week. Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Assuming she read every night, the total reading time for the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages Judy read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \approx 1.3333 \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his age will be three times his nephew's age, which will be \( N + 7 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \) by first dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \frac{51}{3} = N + 7 \]
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we isolate \( N \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:

\[ 17 - 7 = N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
\]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[
70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday and Friday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures}
\]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[
8 \text{ wooden action figures} + 15 \text{ plastic action figures} = 23 \text{ action figures}

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total from her initial amount in the account.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 2 years there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she removes:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial amount in the account:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps to find the final value are as follows:

1. Calculate half of the starting value: \(\frac{x}{2}\).
2. Add this value to the starting value: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\).
4. Subtract 12 from the starting value: \( x - 12 \).
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4: \(\left(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\right) \times (x - 12)\).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into these steps:

1. Half of 20 is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
2. Adding this to 20 gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
3. Dividing 30 by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
4. Subtracting 12 from 20 gives \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).

"To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 when Maggie sets it to 450. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   - 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

The total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating how much less it is compared to Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we first find 30% of the price of Herb's house.

The price of Herb's house is $76,000. Therefore, 30% of $76,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

This means Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract $22,800 from $76,000:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we need to find the combined value of both houses. We add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Thus, the combined value of the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs, we set up the following proportion:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}

Therefore, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:

\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
3B = 4500
\]

Solving for \( B \):

\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Now, let's perform the addition in the numerator:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

     \[
     1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}
     \]

3. **Difference in weight change:**
   - The difference in weight change between eating donuts and Cheerios is:
     \[
     8.75 \, \text{pounds} - (-6.25 \, \text{pounds}) = 8.75 \, \text{pounds} + 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 15 \, \text{pounds}
     \]

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is \(\boxed{15}\) pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.

"Let's denote Jerry's current age by \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Expand the right side of the equation:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
2. Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate the variable:
\[ 0 = x - 10 \]
3. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The additional cost for the porcelain crown is $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of dental work:**

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \( x = 30 \) degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is \( 90 \) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's convert all of Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equal to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equal to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in nickels, so that's \(14\) nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equal to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 \text{ (from quarters)} + 12 \text{ (from dimes)} + 14 \text{ (from nickels)} + 3 \text{ (from pennies)} = 69 \text{ nickels}\]

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the distance (2000 miles) and the speed (400 miles per hour):

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds together per hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Howard has left after his arcade spending.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   Now, we add up all the money Howard spent over the three days.
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Initial Amount:**
   Howard originally had $100.

6. **Money Left:**
   To find out how much money Howard has left, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount.

"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:

- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the first four hours were \( 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour} \).

For four hours, his total earnings were:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:

- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings per hour for the next two hours were \( 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour} \).

For two hours, his total earnings were:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings over the 6 hours:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

4. **Determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{3,480,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:

\[
\frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are used per washing if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per wash in terms of pumps is 1 pump.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps that provide 120 washings:

\[
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
\]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the cost per pump is:

\[
\boxed{1200}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it.

The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the price of the shirt after the discount is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for the shorts, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the items is $52.50, which is more than the $50 Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there is a mistake in the problem setup (since Joe cannot afford both items with the given budget), we can still calculate how much he would have left if he could afford it.

The amount Joe would have left if he could afford both items is:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since Joe cannot afford both items, the practical answer is that he cannot make the purchase with the given budget. However, if we strictly follow the problem's setup and assume he could hypothetically buy both, the amount left would be:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   - Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total dozens of croissants = \( 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \).

2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens:**
   - It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Total butter needed = \( 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 28 \div 4 = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants."

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95060 \]

Now, find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = \$95060 - \$29100 = \$65960 \]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \$65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial 5 months and the subsequent months.

1. **Initial 5 months:**
   - Funding per month: $100,000
   - Total cost for 5 months: \( 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \)

2. **Subsequent months:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration of the research is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) months.
   - The initial 5 months are already accounted for, so the remaining months are \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) months.
   - The cost per month for these subsequent months is 50% more than the initial $100,000, which is \( 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \).
   - Total cost for the remaining 45 months: \( 45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000 \)

3. **Total cost of the research:**
   - Sum of the initial 5 months and the subsequent 45 months: \( 500,000 + 6,750,000 = 7,250,000 \)

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{7250000}\)."
"To determine the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

After the administrators have taken their seats, the number of remaining seats is:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

2. Each intersection has 6 poles.
3. There are 4 intersections.

The total number of poles is:
\[ 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 24 \text{ poles} \]

The total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are functioning. If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total street lights} - 20 \text{ not working street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has already been played 356 times. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644 \text{ times}
   \]

2. The second DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks and has already been played 135 times. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865 \text{ times}
   \]

3. The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the sum of the remaining play times for each DVD:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509 \text{ times}
   \]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \(\boxed{1509}\)."

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To determine the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days:
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. Calculate the total number of cars towed in the week:
   - Add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
     \[

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet to compare it with the height requirement for the roller coaster. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The height requirement for the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the required growth from feet to inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches. Since he grows 2 inches per year, we divide the required growth by his annual growth rate:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will need to wait \(\boxed{4}\) years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster."

"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify how many miles Paisley ran.
2. Calculate how many miles Reggie ran based on the information given.
3. Use the information about Reggie's run to find out how many miles Lynn ran.

First, we know that Paisley ran 4 miles.

Next, we calculate how many miles Reggie ran. According to the problem, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can express Reggie's run as:
\[ \text{Reggie's run} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's run} + 3 \]
Substituting the value of Paisley's run:
\[ \text{Reggie's run} = 5 \times 4 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Reggie ran 23 miles, which is 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can express Lynn's run as:
\[ \text{Lynn's run} = \text{Reggie's run} - 3 \]
Substituting the value of Reggie's run:

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

The distance Alisa biked is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance Alisa} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance Alisa} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

The distance Stanley biked is given by the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance Stanley} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance Stanley} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance Alisa} + \text{Distance Stanley} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the formula: time = distance / rate.
- Therefore, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half the speed through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we sum the times for digging through the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time to dig through soil + time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second month.
4. Find the total earnings for both months.

**Step 1: Determine the amount earned from green hats in the first month.**

We know that the sales from red hats were $400 and this amount is half of the total amount earned from green hats. Therefore, the amount earned from green hats is:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the first month.**

The total earnings for the first month are the sum of the earnings from red and green hats:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings for the second month.**

The earnings for the second month are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total earnings of the first month:
\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

**Step 4: Find the total earnings for both months.**

The total earnings for both months are the sum of the earnings from the first and second months:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total duration James hires the horse-drawn carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Next, we account for the free hour. Since he gets 1 hour free, the effective paid time is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \( \boxed{15} \)."

"To determine how many good days Christina had left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were all bad.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were all neutral.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's break down the good days:
- From the first 8 days, all were good, so 8 good days.
- From the next 3 days, 2 were good (since the sequence was good, neutral, good).

Adding these up:
\[ 8 \text{ (first 8 days)} + 2 \text{ (next 3 days)} = 10 \text{ good days} \]

\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to cover the additional 8 dogs.
   - After buying these toys, James has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.

2. **Second Visit:**
   - When James returns, the number of dogs has doubled from the last count.
   - The number of dogs is now \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to cover the additional 12 dogs.
   - After buying these toys, James has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.

3. **Third Visit:**
   - When James returns again, 3 dogs have left the shelter.
   - The number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.
   - Therefore, James still has 24 toys for 21 dogs.

The total number of toys James needs is the number of toys he has after the last visit, which is 24.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{24}

"To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have together.
2. Subtract this total from their goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.
- Together, they have \(20 + 44 = 64\) signatures.

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
- Their goal is 100 signatures.
- They currently have 64 signatures.
- Therefore, they need \(100 - 64 = 36\) more signatures.

So, the sisters need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine Karen's hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for these 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for two days are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we first determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns one potato makes by dividing 36 by 6:

\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

This means that 1 potato makes 6 hash browns. Now, to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of hash browns one potato makes by the total number of potatoes:

\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) in the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 other adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20} \, \text{kg} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cookies each person has with variables:
- Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
- Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:
1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \).
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \).
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \).
4. Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).

First, substitute \( K = 68 \) into the equation \( K = M - 5 \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Now, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( M = C + 12 \):
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Next, substitute \( M = 73 \) into the equation \( S = M + 23 \):
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now we know:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add these amounts together:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
- Mowing the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
- Therefore, mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
- Mowing the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode takes 40 minutes.
- Therefore, mowing half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

Now, we add the time taken for both halves:
- Time for half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time for half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time taken = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum the costs of apples, bananas, and oranges:
     \[
     \$4 + \$4 + \$6 = \$14
     \]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the age of one of the twins.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the other twin.
- Let \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and \( P_3 \) be the ages of the triplets.

Given that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can write:
\[ T_1 = P_1 + 7 \]

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are:
\[ T_1 + P_1 = 7 \]

The combined ages of all the individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. Therefore, we can write:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 44 \]

Since the triplets are the same age, we can denote their age as \( P \). Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + P + P + P = 44 \]
\[ T_1 + T_2 + 3P = 44 \]

We already know from the first equation that \( T_1 = P + 7 \). Substituting \( T_1 \) in the combined age equation, we get:
\[ (P + 7) + T_2 + 3P = 44 \]
\[ 4P + 7 + T_2 = 44 \]
\[ 4P + T_2 = 37 \]

Since \( T_2 \) is the age of the other twin and the twins are the same age, \( T_2 = T_1 \). Therefore:
\[ 4P + (P + 7) = 37 \]
\[ 5P + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 5P = 30 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( P = 6 \) back into the equation for \( T_1 \):
\[ T_1 = P + 7 \]
\[ T_1 = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T_1 = 13 \]

Thus, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has:
- 20 minutes of math homework,
- 40 minutes of reading homework, and
- 20 minutes of history homework.

Adding these times together, we get:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the number of minutes John has to nap is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of four candies is part of the $3.20, and the rest is the cost of the lollipops.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 10 years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the savings of Rong and Neil together, the total number of coins they have after 10 years is:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. Since there are 5 bananas in the crate, the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. Since there are 12 apples in the crate, the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. Since there are 7 oranges in the crate, the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square in Brittany's quilted comforter.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Next, we sum the total number of squares to find the total area of the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, we calculate:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks, each person will buy 2 drinks and 3 snacks. The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, the cost for drinks per person is:

\[ 2 \text{ drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per drink} = \$4 \]

And the cost for snacks per person is:

\[ 3 \text{ snacks} \times \$2 \text{ per snack} = \$6 \]

So, the total cost per person for drinks and snacks is:

\[ \$4 + \$6 = \$10 \]

Since there are 20 people in the group, the total cost for the group is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times \$10 \text{ per person} = \$200 \]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on snacks and drinks is:

\[

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each female ate 3 dumplings. Since there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Therefore, each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]
Since there are 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Adding the dumplings eaten by the males and the females gives us the total number of dumplings cooked:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Gerald's share is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $100:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60
\]

So, Gerald received $60.

Gerald then spent $10 on a book. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount spent from his initial share:
\[
60 - 10 = 50
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of the river's water used by the city is 40%.
   - The percentage used for industrial purposes is 32%.
   - Therefore, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants**: 
   \[
   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon rolls**: 
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini quiches**: 
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry muffins**: 
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount. To find the discount amount:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total to find the final bill:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 3 scoops of ice cream (2 paid for and 1 free), Erin pays for 2 scoops. Since each scoop costs $1.50, the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays $3.00. Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:

\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

So, Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops. Since each set includes 3 scoops, the total number of scoops she can get is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops of ice cream Erin should buy is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

However, let's verify this step-by-step to ensure accuracy. With $6.00, Erin can buy 4 sets of 2 scoops each (since each set of 3 scoops costs $3.00, and she has $6.00, she can afford 2 sets, which is 4 scoops). Each set of 2 scoops gives her 1 free scoop, so for 2 sets, she gets 2 free scoops. Therefore, the total number of scoops she gets is:

\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Thus, the correct number of scoops Erin should buy is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, calculate the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover, which is two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom:

\[
\text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, since he needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet:

\[
\text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom. 

\[
\boxed{576}

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Total cost of picking: $65
   - Total cost at the store: $75

   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

Therefore, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."

The original planned price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from each component and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg contains 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs: \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese: \( 2 \times 120 = 240 \) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) calories.

Now, we sum the calories from all components:

To find out how many more boxes of cereal she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:
\[ 8 - 4 = 4 \]

Therefore, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time for each condition:
- Helga dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, we calculate the total taps for each foot during the time her arms are raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we sum the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."

"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left.

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Since there are three people (Bryce and his two friends) who each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Therefore, the number of slices each of them ate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

Since there are two people who each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

\[ \text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time it takes for the cat and the dog and then dividing by 2.

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 9x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

  18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many graham cracker sleeves are required to make 24 smores. Each sleeve makes 8 smores:

- **Sleeves needed:**
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves}
  \]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box:

- **Boxes needed:**
  \[
  \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box}
  \]

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since there are two books, the total weight for these is:
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
  \[
  2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ pounds (math and science books)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French book)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English book)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history book)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of books Clara has} = 2 \times \text{Number of books Steven has} \]
\[ 20 = 2 \times \text{Number of books Steven has} \]
\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = \text{Number of books Steven has} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

\[ \text{Number of books Clara has} - \text{Number of books Alice has} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has \(\boxed{4}\) more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and now buys them for $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]

"First, we determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

So, each of the six groups will have 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students. However, since we cannot have half a student in a group, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students if we are to form groups of equal size.

Currently, we have 6 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed to make a total of 12 groups, we subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since each 4-week month consists of 4 weeks, two 4-week months consist of:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to his pile.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 bananas from the 49 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas to his pile.
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas Gunther has is:
\[
\boxed{43}

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- **Glasses**: 8 dozen glasses
  \[
  8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates**: 4 dozen plates
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- **Broken glasses**: 10 glasses
- **Broken plates**: 6 plates

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts:

- **Remaining glasses**:
  \[
  96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates**:
  \[
  48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(40 + 9 = 49\) large buttons and \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large buttons and 3 small stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 25 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 25 large stickers = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has 75 small buttons and 3 small stickers.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 75 small buttons and 0 large buttons (since all large buttons were converted to small buttons).
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(75 + 0 = 75\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, and this total is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   - \( \text{XS} = 11 \)

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - \( \text{S} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - \( \text{M} = 22 - 4 = 18 \)

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - \( \text{L} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - \( \text{XL} = 9 + 6 = 15 \)

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:

\[
\text{Total Shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL}
\]

\[
\text{Total Shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15

"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people who do not think horse #2 will win:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total number of Pomeranians be \( P \).
2. According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3}P \).
3. We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}P = 6
   \]
4. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

5. The problem states that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let the total number of puppies be \( T \). Therefore, the number of Pomeranians is \( \frac{2}{3}T \).
6. We know the number of Pomeranians is 18, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}T = 18
   \]
7. Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it:

\[
\text{Amount given by Ava} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the amount Jayden originally had to the amount given by Ava:

\[
\text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we provide:

\[ \boxed{143} \]

(Note: The answer is rounded to the nearest whole number, as the number of cases of shingles is typically a whole number.)"

Next, we need to account for the additional books Ezra decided to read. Ezra read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra has read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra has read to find the total number of books they have read altogether:

\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine how much Tanya earned over the two days, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns:
  \[
  5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]

\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John needs to raise.
4. Determine how much more John needs to raise after accounting for the school's contribution.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300.

Next, the school will cover half of the cost of the trip:
\[ \text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the amount John needs to raise is:
\[ \text{Amount John needs to raise} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]

John currently has $50. Therefore, the additional amount John needs to raise is:
\[ \text{Additional amount needed} = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of groups that brought seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate for additional hours.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for the 11 hours she worked on Tuesday. Since she worked 8 hours at her regular rate and 3 hours at the special rate, we can break it down as follows:

1. Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars per hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars per hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Add the two amounts together to find the total pay for the day:

3. Identify the number of lion cubs, which is given as 14.

Next, we sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs to find the total number of lions in the enclosure:
\[ 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the $50 bill:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Determine the total salary paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage**: $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: Billy's wage is increased by $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]
3. **On his first anniversary**: Billy's wage is increased by $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is:
   \[
   10.50 + 1.00 = 11.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify which wage to use for the 20-hour work period, we assume the wage after the first anniversary, which is $11.50 per hour.

Next, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
- Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, so:
  \[
  10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally for a 20-hour work period:

- **Billy's earnings**:
  \[
  11.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Sally's earnings**:
  \[
  10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \).
- Each student plants 1 tree.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \).
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Finally, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."

   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \)
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \)
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed:
  \[
  340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680
  \]

- Total number of students:
  \[
  500 \text{ (third-graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 1000
  \]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68

"To determine how much money Jack and his friends use, we need to calculate the total time each person plays and then convert that into the number of quarters required.

1. **Jack's Play Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time Jack plays: 4 hours = 240 minutes.
   - Number of quarters Jack uses: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **First Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, so 10 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time this friend plays: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

3. **Second Friend's Play Time:**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 30 minutes per quarter.
   - Total time this friend plays: \( 1.5 \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Number of quarters this friend uses: \( \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack: 12 quarters
   - First friend: 12 quarters
   - Second friend: 12 quarters
   - Total: \( 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 \text{ quarters} \).

Thus, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{36}\) quarters."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ 4z + 2z + z + z + 2z = 10 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
\[
3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = \$1500
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
\[
2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = \$3000
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
\[
\$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we add the cupcakes he already has and subtract this total from 63.

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we determine how many more cupcakes he needs to buy by subtracting the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Therefore, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day in hours.
2. Determine the time Sandy walked on the second day in hours.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we calculate the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we have:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the total time she walked over the two days in hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the fact that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

     \]

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
     \[
     \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260/\text{week}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has, which is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Thus, the number of cards Becca has is:

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs additional items: 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.

The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. We need to calculate the cost for the additional mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures.

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, we add the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$129.00 + \$30.00 + \$15.00 + \$150.00 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$224.00 \]

So, the total cost for Angela to have all her items installed is **$224.00**."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

Now, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Let the time taken by the four turtles be \(t\). The total distance \(D\) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \times \text{speed of one turtle} \times t = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} \times t = 2vt \]

Since the distance \(D\) is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]

To find \(t\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \(2v\):
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take the four turtles \(\boxed{27}\) hours to travel across the highway."
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Let \( K \) represent the number of dishes Kora made. According to the problem, \( K = 20 \).
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, the number of dishes Rory made, \( R \), is:
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, the number of dishes Jada made, \( J \), is:
   \[
   J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

Next, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora to find the total number of dishes:
\[
J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces daily with 3 cows:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

   \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Remaining: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 12 millimeters
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Remaining: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 12 millimeters
   \[
   \text{Remaining length} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{16}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Amount needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is:

\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer: 10**"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students in the other two categories:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good in English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total white shirts: 40
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

**Final Answer:**
10"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost for the baskets of green food:

Next, calculate the total cost for the baskets of red food with the discount:
- 3 baskets of red food at $18 each, with a $2 discount per basket: \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars per basket.
- Therefore, for 3 baskets: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Now, add the total costs together:
- Total cost for green food: $75
- Total cost for red food: $48
- Combined total: \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{123}

\[
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year = \( 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \).

Therefore, the town will have built a total of 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( I \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( I = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( M = I - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: Let's denote your mom's age as \( M_{mom} \), so \( M_{mom} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( I + B + M + M_{mom} = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( I \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ I = B - 3 \]
\[ M = I - 2 = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]
\[ M_{mom} = 3B - 1 \]

Now substitute these into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back to find the ages of the others:
\[ I = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]
\[ M = B - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \]
\[ M_{mom} = 3B - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \]

To verify, add all the ages:
\[ I + B + M + M_{mom} = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87 \]
The sum is correct.

Therefore, your age is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks. To confirm, 6 packs would only provide:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 48 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is not enough since 48 is less than 54. Therefore, 7 packs will provide:

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is more than enough, and it ensures that Mr. Jackson will have some extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the First Day:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"To determine how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

1. **Day 0 (Initial Infection):**
   - Number of infected people: 10

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
   - Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

3. **Day 2:**
   - Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
   - Total infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

4. **Day 3:**
   - Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
   - Total infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. So, we subtract $80 from Rafaela's total tips to find Julieta's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta. We add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her son.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

**Final Answer: 3**"
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. We subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the total number of banana bread loaves she baked. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, over 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**
   - There are 50 students.
   - Each student was given 10 burritos.
   \[
   50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed:**
   - Add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.
   \[
   500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}
   \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we have \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \). We can substitute these into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost. We calculate Keenan's share as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400 and there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing his monthly share by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"

   - Cost per bottle of soda = \(\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\).

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = \(\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $3.00.
   - Total cost for 3 bottles = \(3 \times 3.00 = 9.00\).

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - Cost per bottle of water = $2.00.
   - Total cost for 2 bottles = \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\).

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost for David's purchase.

5. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:**
   - Total cost = \(9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00\).

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is \(\boxed{13.00}\)."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money. David starts with $12.48, so:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. We can calculate her hourly rate by dividing her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. After receiving 28 more marbles from his friend, he has:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \text{ marbles} \]

Next, Paul loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. To find out how many marbles he loses, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ marbles} \]

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total, we get:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ marbles} \]

So, the final number of marbles Paul has left is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens.
   \[
   \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
   \]

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit Isaias aims to make:**
   Isaias aims to make a profit of $2000.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 2000
   \]

4. **Determine the total cost of the chickens:**
   The total revenue from selling the chickens is the sum of the cost of the chickens and the profit.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between the two:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent \(\frac{1}{4}\) as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure:

\[
\text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Now, we sum up all the expenses to find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[
\boxed{575}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's assume Sarah uses all the money from the sale to buy a new rope. The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter. To find out how much money she will have left over, we need to know the length of the new rope she plans to buy. However, the problem does not specify the length of the new rope. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she buys a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can calculate the leftover money after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Money left over} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \(2 \times \frac{10}{5} = 2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

So, after giving away all the toys, Argo has \(\boxed{50}\) toys left."
"To determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day:
   - On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Wednesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

2. Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days:
   \[
   125 \text{ (Tuesdays)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesdays)} + 250 \text{ (Fridays)} = 500
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
- Birds nesting in the bushes: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

The total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[6 + 4 + 24 = 34\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"Lani initially baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \]

Next, she placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, the number of cookies in each jar is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is:

\[
\boxed{55}

"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the salad is $6.
2. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods every day. Therefore, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since Ellen eats two carrots every day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

So, the cost of one carrot every day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate his weekly earnings by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Mark makes a week is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first figure out how much she earned from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- In the second week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work each week.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is the sum of what she earned from Joe, Kamala, and Alba. Since Joe paid $6 each week, and Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times, and Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times, we can write the total earnings from mowing lawns as:
\[ 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade last month were $80. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Therefore, we have:
\[ 54x + L = 80 \]

To find \( x \), we need to determine how much Tasha was paid per lawn mow. Since Joe paid $6 for her work each week and she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times each week, the payment per lawn mow is:
\[ \text{Payment per lawn mow} = \frac{6}{x} \]

However, we don't need to find \( x \) explicitly to solve for \( L \). We can directly use the total earnings equation:
\[ L = 80 - 54x \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can infer that the value of \( x \) is such that the total earnings equation holds true. Given the total earnings and the known payments, we can solve for \( L \) directly:
\[ L = 80 - 54x \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( x \) but we know the total earnings, we can assume the simplest case where the equation balances. If we assume \( x = 1 \) (a common simple assumption for such problems without additional constraints), then:
\[ L = 80 - 54 \cdot 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we have:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car each month:**
   \[

   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from renting the car:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} - \text{Car payment} = 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can calculate the number of notebooks she originally had as follows:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after she bought the additional 5 notebooks. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to understand the total amount of soup.

Calvin and his wife are both adults, so they will need 2 adult bowls of soup. Additionally, they have two children, and each child will need 1 child's bowl of soup. Therefore, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:

\[ 2 \text{ (adult bowls)} + 2 \text{ (child bowls)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and Calvin and his wife are the only adults, they will use 2 of those bowls. This leaves:

\[ 4 \text{ (total adult bowls)} - 2 \text{ (used by adults)} = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

Since 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls, the remaining 2 adult bowls are equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ adult bowls} \times 2 \text{ (child bowls per adult bowl)} = 4 \text{ child bowls} \]

These 4 child bowls are the leftover soup. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ child bowls per child} \]

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

\[
\text{Cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
\]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:

\[
\boxed{8.00}

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Now, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Therefore, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is \(7 - 3 = 4\).

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the final number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 blue and 6 red.

Final numerical answer:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}
\]"
"First, determine how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. Next, we need to account for the fact that Joseph lost 2 of his books. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the original number of books Joseph had:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

Thus, Joseph currently has \(\boxed{16}\) books."
"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Next, we subtract these 6 marbles from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. We subtract these 10 marbles from the 24 marbles Dean has left:

\[
24 - 10 = 14
\]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. This can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. This is calculated by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are given that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there are 20 red balloons. We need to find the number of yellow balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]
We know that \( R = 20 \), so we substitute 20 for \( R \) in the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
Next, we isolate \( Y \) by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
Then, we solve for \( Y \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs for 3000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles required for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Thus, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   - Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Wednesday is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Thursday is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:

\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This $28 is the total amount of money that Julia and Nadine had combined. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide this total by 2 to find out how much each girl received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

14 pieces - 2 pieces = 12 pieces.

**Final answer:** 12 pieces are left."
"First, let's determine the number of students playing tennis and volleyball.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.

Next, let's find the number of students playing soccer:
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, we add the number of students from each activity to find the total number of students:
4. Total number of students = students playing tennis + students playing volleyball + students playing soccer
   \[
   6 + 12 + 38 = 56
   \]

Therefore, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = \( 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). We can substitute \( p = j + 10 \) and \( P = 2j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4j = 80 \]
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

1. **Boxes donated by 10 people:**
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Boxes already owned:**
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. **Total boxes:**
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes.

4. **Total tables needed:**
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables required.

5. **New tables needed:**
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables}
   \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance = 400 feet (Zoey) + 420 feet (Sydney) = 820 feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."

"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the initial 12-hour stay and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the initial 12-hour stay cost:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Thus, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total charge:
\[
40 + 105 + 60 = 205

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. The amount he spent initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Cayley will earn a total commission of:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the team is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- There are 100 pages per inch of paper stack.
- Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side.

First, calculate the total number of pages per inch:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:
\[ 100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is used for two pages (one on each side), the total number of sheets of paper is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of pages in the book, which we have already calculated as:
\[ 150 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was in bed and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was in bed:**
   - She went to bed at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
   - From 12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is \( 5 \times 60 + 55 = 355 \) minutes.
   - Total time in bed: \( 120 + 355 = 475 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is \( 38 - 15 = 23 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total time in bed: \( 475 - 23 = 452 \) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{452}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \). According to Kelly, Courtney reported 120% of the actual number, which is 48. This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have picked up and carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey). Therefore, \( J = 1 \).

Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the equation for the total number of balls, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, they filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40. Since there were 29 holes at the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:

\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. This is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:

\[
\boxed{225}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the third equation:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

To verify, we can find \( X \) using the second equation:
\[ X = S + 5 \]
\[ X = 147 + 5 \]
\[ X = 152 \]

Finally, we check the total number of Pokemon:
\[ X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \]
The total is correct, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in the southward direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southward distance by subtracting the northward distance from the total southward distance:

- Total southward distance: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total northward distance: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net southward distance:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day.

1. **Initial Batch Made by Greta:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies Sent Home from Office:**
   At her office, she was sent home with half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies at Home for the Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for the surprise party.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Before the Party:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten During the Party:**
   During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Left Over:**
   Subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, Nani's sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is $600 each. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times \text{perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and possibly sold. She kept 1/4 of these boxes for herself:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the boxes she had after giving some away:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

These 6 boxes are the ones she sold. Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then find the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables and calculate the number of boxes sold:

1. **Saturday:**
   - Gingerbread: 10 boxes
   - Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

2. **Sunday:**
   - Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
   - Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday:
- Gingerbread on Sunday: \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie on Sunday: 15 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes sold for each type over the two days:
- Total gingerbread: \(10 + 15 = 25\) boxes
- Total apple pie: \(4 + 15 = 19\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of baked good:
- Earnings from gingerbread: \(25 \text{ boxes} \times \$6/\text{box} = \$150\)
- Earnings from apple pie: \(19 \text{ boxes} \times \$15/\text{box} = \$285\)

     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, we add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling and sautéing.

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

1. **Low Speed for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High Speed for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No Air Conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Subsequent warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is:
\[ 18 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, \( D = 30 \) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then his age when he saw the comet for the first time is \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Number of checks per year: \(12\) (since there are 12 months in a year).

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Number of checks per year: \(12\).

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Number of checks per year: \(2 \times 12 = 24\).

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - Number of checks per year: \(4\) (since there are 4 quarters in a year).

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers.
2. Determine how much money Adam's mother gave him.
3. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him.
4. Calculate the total amount of money given by his parents.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents, which is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total watermelon is divided into \( 8x \) parts.

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of these parts. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Converting this fraction to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's break down the time Doctor Jones will spend on each activity:

1. **Clinic Work**: 9 hours
2. **Inpatient Rounds**: 20 minutes per inpatient, and he has 9 inpatients.
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = \(9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}\)
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\)
3. **Appointments**: 30 minutes per appointment, and he has 10 appointments.
   - Total time for appointments = \(10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}\)
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\)

Now, let's sum up the total time spent on all activities:
- Total time = Time at clinic + Time for inpatient rounds + Time for appointments
- Total time = 9 hours + 3 hours + 5 hours = 17 hours

Since Doctor Jones has 24 hours in a day, the time left to update his records is:
- Time left = 24 hours - 17 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons of water needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 826 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \( 9 + 5 = 14 \).

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \( 14 - 3 = 11 \).

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   - To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together.
   - Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge, accounting for the different rates of charge loss.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank is at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is calculated as follows:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of pieces in these 2 packs is:

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Subtracting the pieces Anne kept from the total number of pieces gives the number of pieces she gave to her friends:

\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early. So, the number of guests after early checkouts is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late. So, the number of guests after late checkouts is:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **People checking in during the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of people checking in during the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, the number of guests after the afternoon check-ins is:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]

5. **People checking in after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner. So, the final number of guests is:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Therefore, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

Thus, the friends found \(\boxed{30}\) eggs."
"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes:
\[
40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92 \]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 100\% - 92\% = 8\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn back the money he spent on college loans and the income he lost by not working during his college years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working:**
   Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year. He did not work for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   This includes both the total loans and the total income lost.
   \[
   \text{Total amount to earn back} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \text{ dollars}

Thus, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost and the total amount won over the three races.

- Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)
- Total win: \( W_2 = 11 \)

The net loss is the total loss minus the total win:
\[ \text{Net loss} = L_1 + L_3 - W_2 = 21.5 - 11 = 10.5 \]

To find the average loss per race, we divide the net loss by the number of races (3):
\[ \text{Average loss per race} = \frac{\text{Net loss}}{3} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 \]

Therefore, the average loss per race is:
\[ \boxed{3.5} \]"

2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now is 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now is 51 inches.
   - The difference is \(52 - 51 = 1\) inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is **1 inch**."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.25}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is \( x = 6 \). To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate the value step by step:

1. Calculate the value after the first year:
\[ \text{Value after 1 year} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

2. Calculate the value after the second year:
\[ \text{Value after 2 years} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

3. Calculate the value after the third year:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9831.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9831.78} \]"
"To determine the number of Spanish books in the library, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of English books:

   \]

2. Calculate the number of German books:
   - 10% of the 50 books are in German.
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of Spanish books:
   - The rest of the books are in Spanish. Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   120 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Twice the number of people who descended (which is 50) board the train.
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Adding these 100 people to the current number of people on the train.
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 more people descend from the train.

"First, we need to calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost of $120.

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 4 twin sheets are used per week, it will take 2 loads to wash all the twin sheets (2 sets per load).
   - 1 king sheet per week requires 1 load.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   Since each set of 1.5 pounds costs $6.00, the total cost for 4 sets is:
   \[
   4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is a fixed fee of $125. Additionally, there is a charge of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the fixed rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

First, we know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining three-quarters of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Maggie's original amount of money as follows:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's original money} = 60
\]
To find Maggie's original money, we solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
\text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80. Since she spent a quarter of it, she spent:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
\]
Thus, Maggie has $60 left.

Next, we know that Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the remaining two-thirds of her money is $60. We can set up the equation for Riza's original amount of money as follows:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's original money} = 60
\]
To find Riza's original money, we solve for it by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
\text{Riza's original money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90. Since she spent one-third of it, she spent:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]
Thus, Riza has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to last a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"To determine the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed, we need to consider the pieces he completed from each puzzle.

1. Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces he completed from this puzzle is:
   \[
   \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. Teddy then started and finished another 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, the number of pieces he completed from this puzzle is:
   \[
   500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. Adding the pieces from both puzzles gives us the total number of pieces Teddy placed:
   \[
   250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses can be bought at $2 each, the cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change. 

Thus, the number of quarters she leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

   - Number of sodas sold: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total revenue from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Next, we sum the revenues from all items:
\[
33 + 99 + 30 = 162
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves 30 minutes after it arrives, so the second train arrives 30 minutes after 30 minutes, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 5 minutes after it arrives, which is 65 minutes after the first train arrives.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves 65 minutes after the first train arrives, so the third train arrives 60 minutes after 65 minutes, which is 125 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 125 minutes after the first train arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes after the first train arrives, so the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after 125 minutes, which is 145 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at 0 minutes. The fourth train arrives at 145 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price of $2000.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:

"To determine Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:
\[ B = 90 \]

The problem states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be expressed with the equation:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
2. James walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. He then had to walk back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.
5. James's walking speed is 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then extend that over the 6-hour workday.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer each hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales added to the field each hour:**
   - Net bales per hour = Bales made by the farmer - Bales picked up by the truck
   - Net bales per hour = 5 - 3 = 2 bales

4. **Calculate the total number of bales added to the field over 6 hours:**
   - Total bales added = Net bales per hour * Number of hours
   - Total bales added = 2 * 6 = 12 bales

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the field starts with 0 bales (assuming no initial bales), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total bales added.
   - Number of bales left = 12

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours.

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[

"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( \boxed{1080} \) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step to determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 of them.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
   - Now, there are 3 shaken sodas and 8 unshaken sodas.

2. **Brother's Action:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - After his action, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken sodas: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
     - Unshaken sodas: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

3. **Total Sodas Left:**
   - After Ellen's brother takes his share, there are \(2 + 6 = 8\) sodas left.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas left divided by the total number of sodas left.
   - Number of shaken sodas left: 2
   - Total number of sodas left: 8
   - Probability = \(\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\)

5. **Convert to Percentage:**
   - \(\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\)
   - \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\%\)

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The speed of the first train is 60 miles per hour.
2. The speed of the second train is half of the first train's speed, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled.

Total distance apart: \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."

   - Total people helped = 6 people/day \(\times\) 40 days = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, as these are the people who attended the ceremony.

First, we calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

\[
12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

\[
20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people who attended the ceremony:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Breaks: 2 breaks × 15 minutes each = 30 minutes

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the daily total is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours this totals over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **New Purchase:**
   Sheila bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   \[
   \text{Discount on frying pan} = 20\% \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of frying pan} = 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Additional Purchase:**
   She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00.
   \[
   \text{Discount on towels} = 10\% \times 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of towels} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Adding the cost of the frying pan and the towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]

6. **Final Balance:**
   Adding the new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

Thus, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

   \[
   \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, we calculate Caroline's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Thus, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves per paycheck:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}

"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul each want.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we add the amounts that Pierre and Paul want to find out how many kilograms of apples they will take together:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, we subtract the 7 kg that Pierre and Paul want from the total to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the number of kilograms of apples that James will have left is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (to ensure it's ""well over 4 hours"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the time each person took to complete their chores:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these two workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380\]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180\] toys.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[

   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that the total number of stickers Kris received is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \). So, we have \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

Now, we solve for \( S \):
\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16 \implies S = 16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Thus, Seth originally had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it takes to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance flown per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

**Vince is now 9 years old.**"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know \( A = 13 \), \( M = 13 \), \( C = 21 \), and \( S = 9 \). The problem asks how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = \( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount John makes is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Let's denote the speed at which she walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we can write the equation for the time spent on the beach as:
\[ \text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Speed on beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]
From this, we can solve for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles/minute} \]

Next, we need to find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, so:
\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles/minute} \]
The distance she covers on the sidewalk is 1 mile, so the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time spent walking by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have \(\boxed{26}\) marbles."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which allows Donny to drink it.

Let's calculate the temperature of the mixture in the water bottle. The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total heat content of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

- Heat content from the 33-degree water: \( 4 \times 33 = 132 \) degree-ounces.
- Heat content from the \( T \)-degree water: \( 1 \times T = T \) degree-ounces.

The average temperature of the mixture is given by the total heat content divided by the total volume:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the original cost:

\[ 90\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.90 \times \$40.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops per 3 potatoes}
   \]
   Therefore, 1 scoop of mashed potatoes requires:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \text{ potatoes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   Since 1 scoop requires \(\frac{3}{2}\) potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Lemons from one tree in one year
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year. Since he has 5 trees, the number of lemons from one tree in one year is 6.

Step 2: Total lemons from all trees in one year
Since Tim has 5 trees, the total number of lemons from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Total lemons from all trees over a decade
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. Let's denote the number of men by \(5x\) and the number of women by \(9x\). The total number of passengers can be expressed as:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

So, the number of men is:
\[5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\]

And the number of women is:
\[9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\]

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. If 20 women alight, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The price of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84

   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers who wear bows:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers who wear bows is 2, and the total number of babies wearing bows is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tax reports received from Monday to Friday.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total.

Let's start with the total number of tax reports received last week:
\[ 5168 \]

Next, we subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Then, we subtract the reports received on Thursday and Friday:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{1125} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of the land for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{170}
\]"
"To determine Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: 
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**:
   \[
   \text{Lamar finds 5 eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**:
   \[
   \text{Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**:
   \[
   \text{Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Eggs found by Mei**:
   \[
   \text{Mei finds half as many as Charlie} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Next, we sum up all the eggs found by the children:
\[
5 \text{ (Lamar)} + 10 \text{ (Stacy)} + 8 \text{ (Charlie)} + 4 \text{ (Mei)} = 27 \text{ eggs}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden:
\[
36 \text{ (initial)} - 27 \text{ (found)} = 9 \text{ eggs}
\]

Thus, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1248}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **Initial Production (5-year-old tree):**
   - A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

2. **Production at 6 years:**
   - A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **Production at 7 years:**
   - A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **Production at 8 years:**
   - An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
   - Therefore, \( x - 200 \) fruits.

5. **Production at 10 years:**
   - A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).

6. **Production at 9 years:**
   - A 9-year-old tree produces no fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced each year:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these together:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{2550}

"First, let's determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of it. 

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. 

Next, we need to find out how much money Jack has now. Jack originally had $100, and he received an additional $20 from Sophia.

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and after giving $3 to his little sister, he is left with:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Define the variables for the amounts of each color:**
   Let \( R \) represent the amount of red paint.
   Let \( W \) represent the amount of white paint.
   Let \( P \) represent the amount of purple paint.
   Let \( Y \) represent the amount of yellow paint.

3. **Set up the relationships based on the problem statement:**
   - The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, \( R = W = P \).
   - Half the mural is yellow, so \( Y = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

4. **Express the total amount of paint in terms of \( R \):**
   Since \( R = W = P \), we can write the total amount of paint as:
   \[
   R + W + P + Y = 12
   \]
   Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) and \( Y \) with 6, we get:
   \[
   R + R + R + 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   3R + 6 = 12
   \]

6. **Solve for \( R \):**
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3R = 6
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   R = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per cycle}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - \( C_{n+1} = C_n \times (1 - 0.20) = C_n \times 0.80 \).

4. **Find the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.
   - Starting with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches, we calculate the remaining chalk each day:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     C_1 &= 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \\
     C_2 &= 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \\
     C_3 &= 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \\
     C_4 &= 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches} \\
     C_5 &= 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches} \\
     \end{align*}

"First, let's determine the number of girls and boys on varsity.

- The total number of girls is 12. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
  \]
- The total number of boys is 12. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 \text{ girls} + 3 \text{ boys} = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students in the class:
\[
12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 \text{ students} - 7 \text{ students on varsity} = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of teeth James has:**
   \[
   \text{Total teeth} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of teeth the dentist drills:**
   \[
   \text{Teeth drilled} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps:**

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

**Step 1: Translate the first piece of information into an equation.**

Colin's age in seven years is \( C + 7 \). According to the problem, Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times this value:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

**Step 2: Translate the second piece of information into an equation.**

In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \). According to the problem, this age is a third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

First, we have:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books, which totals:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the $27000 equally among 3 schools.
   - To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
     \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples and put one in his pocket, so he has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 apple in his hand.

2. **First Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple in his hand into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, so he now has 1 apple in his pocket (from the first step) + 1 apple from the tree + 1 apple from the 5 picked up = 3 apples in his pocket, and 1 apple in his hand.

3. **Second Throw:**
   - Newton threw the apple in his hand at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
   - Newton picked up these 6 apples, put all but one in his pocket, so he now has 3 apples in his pocket (from the previous step) + 1 apple from the tree + 1 apple from the 6 picked up = 5 apples in his pocket, and 1 apple in his hand.

4. **Final Step:**
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples, which are the 1 apple in his hand and the 5 in his pocket, so he now has 1 + 5 = 6 apples in his pocket.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags required to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the order:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles run on the days with 3 miles to the miles run on the days with 5 miles:
- Total miles = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\).

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

This means that for every hour, Jay effectively gains:

\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year or the year Digimon came out, we can infer that the 20th anniversary is a reference point. However, the age difference between John and Jim is constant, so we don't need the exact year.

2. **Establish the relationship between John's and Jim's ages:**
   - At the time Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.

3. **Determine John's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years since Digimon came out.
   - Therefore, John's age at the time Digimon came out was \( 28 - x \).

4. **Express Jim's age at the time Digimon came out:**
   - Let \( y \) be Jim's age at the time Digimon came out.
   - According to the problem, John was twice as old as Jim at that time, so \( 28 - x = 2y \).

5. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Jim's current age is \( y + x \).

6. **Solve for \( y \) using the given information:**
   - From the equation \( 28 - x = 2y \), we can express \( y \) as \( y = \frac{28 - x}{2} \).

7. **Find Jim's current age:**
   - Since \( y + x \) is Jim's current age, substitute \( y \) with \( \frac{28 - x}{2} \):
     \[
     \text{Jim's current age} = \frac{28 - x}{2} + x
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Jim's current age} = \frac{28 - x + 2x}{2} = \frac{28 + x}{2}
     \]

8. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   - Since the problem does not provide the exact year Digimon came out, we can use the fact that the age difference is constant. We know John is currently 28, and we need to find Jim's current age.

9. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - If John is 28 and he was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     28 - 20 = 2 \times (x - 20)
     \]
     \[
     8 = 2x - 40
     \]
     \[
     48 = 2x
     \]
     \[
     x = 24
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 24 \) back into the equation for Jim's current age:
     \[
     \text{Jim's current age} = \frac{28 + 24}{2} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
     \]

Therefore, Jim is currently \boxed{26} years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means the initial number of bandages they had at the start of the first day must be adjusted to account for the 31 bandages difference (109 - 78 = 31).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 - 31 = -19 + 50 = 31\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from the hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we need to calculate the earnings from each task and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   - Jason did his laundry once.
   - Earnings from laundry: \(1 \times \$3.00 = \$3.00\).

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   - Jason cleaned his room once.
   - Earnings from cleaning his room: \(1 \times \$1.50 = \$1.50\).

3. **Earnings from taking the trash to the curb:**
   - Jason took the trash out twice.
   - Earnings from taking the trash: \(2 \times \$0.75 = \$1.50\).

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   - Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times.
   - Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: \(6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00\).

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 + \$3.00 = \$9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine how many fish have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the height of the first floor to the ceiling is 180 inches, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells after Alphas:

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

We know the following:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.
- The average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles.

The formula for the average is the total miles walked divided by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3
\]

To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to clear the denominator:

\[
1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12
\]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
8 + x = 12
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[
x = 4
\]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their total working time is spent cleaning the classrooms. The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated by dividing the total cleaning time by the total working time and then multiplying by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[ 15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Since 110 divided by 55 is exactly 2, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Red hats**: Half of the hats are red.

"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price per bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To determine the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **Initial Value:**
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = \$9000
   \]

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = 0.20 \times 4410 = 882

   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Value of pennies: \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine how much money Janet has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract that from the $40 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

So, Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Next, we subtract the total amount spent from the $40 her parents gave her:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Janet has left is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in one week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = \$120 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. The buyer is willing to pay $5 per toy for half of the collection and $7 per toy for the other half.

First, we calculate the number of toys in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, 6 toys will be sold at $5 each, and the other 6 toys will be sold at $7 each.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the first half:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the second half:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount of money Matthew would earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

Therefore, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes while the dog continues to dig new ones. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes. Since the net reduction is 3 holes per day, the number of days required to fill in all the holes is:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, we calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

\[
\boxed{1000}

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

\[10 + 20 = 30\]

**Final Answer: 30**"
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, we add up the amounts raised by each person to find the total:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, Vanessa took \(\boxed{64}\) minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one reservation:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost for the meals is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

Therefore, the total cost for one reservation is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night is:
\[6 \times 15 = \$90\]

If the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[90 \times 2 = \$180\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the selling price per watermelon is:

\[
\boxed{2.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. Since Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. Therefore, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 years old, and John had James when he was 19, we can confirm that John is currently:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

The problem states that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the age of John's youngest son now is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

Finally, we need to determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
