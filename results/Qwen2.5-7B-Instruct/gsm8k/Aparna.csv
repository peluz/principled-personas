"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he does this per week.

So, the calculation is:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

First, we know that each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = 0.60 * 200 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time for the return trip is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic + 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph).
     - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Distance traveled in the first leg = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled in the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.
   - Total distance traveled = 180 miles + 135 miles = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John initially drove 180 miles away from home and then traveled 135 miles back, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is:
     - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
45 miles."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate the earnings for each part:

- Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. So, we calculate 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Therefore, the program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. So, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop dance students by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant would maximize profit by purchasing the electronic gadgets, as the final value is higher.

**Final profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96**

Therefore, the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs, and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- Jill gets paid $20 per hour for teaching.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.

Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
- Jill gets paid $30 per hour for coaching.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.

Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly earnings:
Total weekly earnings = $700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1150/week

Finally, to find her annual salary, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:
Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Final answer:
\[ 7 \text{ dozens} \]"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's find the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Using the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time, we can rearrange it to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles) walking. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time:

\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before and after the spill, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water spilled:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter of water.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract 23 from Raymond's current age of 25.

25 - 23 = 2

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the information that Kyle bought it for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's calculate the value:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:
104"
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. So, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add the guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily hours spent on each dog.
2. Multiply the daily hours by the number of dogs.
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily hours spent on all dogs is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly hours spent are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

Final numerical answer:
70"
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many jewels Aaron has.
2. Use the number of Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Aaron has 25 jewels. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of Aaron's jewels to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes
Total points = 4 points + 5 points
Total points = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets.
   - John has 13 lego sets.
   - He sells each lego set for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = 13 * $15 = $195.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the video games.
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total cost of video games = 8 * $20 = $160.

3. Now, determine how much money John has left after buying the video games.
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - This means the money he spent on video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets.
   - So, $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

4. Since the money John got from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165 on video games and has $5 left, it means he has no lego sets left to count.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

0

John still has 0 lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. So, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed as follows:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking in a six-hour period. Let's calculate the time spent running and walking:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she can travel while running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate the grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To find out how many 6-inch pieces Tracy obtained from a 4-foot long wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, for the return trip, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time \(T\) it takes to travel back is given by the formula:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed}} \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ T = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each.

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each.
- The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires.

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue from Thursday and Friday:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens to the kittens born to the house cats:

7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

The final numerical answer is:

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension she gets after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension will be the base pension plus the additional 5%:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays $140 per month for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than $140 per month for 6 months.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the first half} = 140 \times 6 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced monthly cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly cost} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the second half} = 126 \times 6 \]

Finally, we add the costs of both halves to get the total amount paid for the year:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (140 \times 6) + (126 \times 6) \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, to find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Final numerical answer:
36"
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from the students.

First, let's find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so that's 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\) classes.

Next, let's find the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students is \(33 \times 15 = 495\) students.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\) dollars.

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week."

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 slices.
- Each slice is sold for $3.

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices.
- Each slice is sold for $4.

Now, let's calculate:

For brownies: \(43 \times 3 = 129\) dollars.
For cheesecakes: \(23 \times 4 = 92\) dollars.

Adding these together: \(129 + 92 = 221\) dollars.

So, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest to be paid.
3. Calculate the total amount to be paid including interest.
4. Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest to be paid.
The interest rate is 2% per unit.
Total interest = 5 * $150 * 2% = 5 * $150 * 0.02 = $15

Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid including interest.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 4: Divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3
Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

For the remaining days in the first year, which is \(365 - 180 = 185\) days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Determine how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:
   \[
   6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}

1. Determine how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:
   \[
   9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we compare the two costs to find the savings:

1. The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 is $15.00.
2. The cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 is $9.00.
3. The savings by choosing the cheaper option is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The problem also states that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:

First time: 4 times
Second time: 12 times
Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate her salary after 5 years.
2. Calculate her salary after 6 years.
3. Calculate her salary after 7 years.

**Step 1: Calculate her salary after 5 years.**

Sylvie's initial salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary will be increased by 10% of the initial salary.

\[ \text{Salary after 5 years} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

**Step 2: Calculate her salary after 6 years.**

After 6 years, her salary will again be increased by 10% of the salary after 5 years.

\[ \text{Salary after 6 years} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

**Step 3: Calculate her salary after 7 years.**

After 7 years, her salary will be increased by 10% of the salary after 6 years.

\[ \text{Salary after 7 years} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service (which is after 7 years total) is $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
   - Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

2. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
   - Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

3. Add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:
   - Total potato salad needed = \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's denote the time Gerald used to take to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes needed by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated as the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

This total of 25 cars is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its volume. After that, we can multiply by 3 to get the total volume for all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year."

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to get the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat for 80 feet, we set up the following proportion:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

So, the total cost of the lumber is:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- She sells the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has gone up 50%, the new price per board is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
  \]
  Therefore, the revenue from selling the ten boards is:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- She sells the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The new price per board is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
  \]
  Therefore, the revenue from selling the five boards is:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

So, the total revenue from selling the lumber is:
\[
\$150 + \$120 = \$270
\]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of:
\[
\boxed{\$90}

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is:
2 * 5 = 10 apples

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is:
8 / 2 = 4 oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

Therefore, they have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept:
8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

Over the two days, she slept:
6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each day for the remaining three days.

Over the three days, she slept:
7 + 7 + 7 = 21 hours.

Adding up all the hours she slept throughout the week:
8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 21 (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) = 41 hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 41 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, so she covers:

\[ 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances covered in both parts of her run gives the total distance:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many babies as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( B = 2Q \)
- \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \)

Now, we substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \)
- \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, so its cost is $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so its cost is $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so its cost is $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

Total cost of non-food items = $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items to get the final cost of the non-food items:

Final cost of non-food items = $10 + $1 = $11.

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the final cost of the non-food items:

Total cost = Cost of food items + Final cost of non-food items
Total cost = $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $11 (non-food items) = $16.

So, the final numerical answer is:

$16."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 1 bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5.

So, the cost for supplies per client is:
\[2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9\]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for supplies will be:
\[8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72\]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[\text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20\]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[\boxed{20}\]"
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Since John can harvest every 3 months, in a year (which has 12 months), he can harvest:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Step 3: Now, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the total number of hectares:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave the cashier more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:
James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

Final answer:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last fry, leaving 5 behind.

Let's calculate step by step:

After Dave ate 14 fries, there were \( x - 14 \) fries left.

The seagull ate 7 fries, so there were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries left.

The three pigeons ate 9 fries, so there were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries left.

Let's denote the remaining fries as \( y \), so \( y = x - 30 \).

The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so \( \frac{2}{3}y \) were stolen, leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y \) fries.

After the raccoon, there were \( \frac{1}{3}y \) fries left. The ants carried off the last fry, leaving 5 fries, so \( \frac{1}{3}y - 1 = 5 \).

Solving for \( y \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}y - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \implies y = 18
\]

Since \( y = x - 30 \), we have:
\[
x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
\]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we can break it down by the days of the week and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
2 days * 2 hours/day * 2 = 8 hours

Now, we add the hours from both sets of days:
9 hours (MWF) + 8 hours (TT) = 17 hours per week

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Total length of baguettes in feet: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) feet.

Now, we need to convert the lengths of rolls and croissants to feet to add them to the length of baguettes.

- **Converting rolls to feet:**
  - 1200 inches = \(1200 \div 12 = 100\) feet.

- **Converting croissants to feet:**
  - 720 inches = \(720 \div 12 = 60\) feet.

Finally, we add the lengths together:
- Total length in feet: \(100 + 60 + 120 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, let's calculate the total for 2 months:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Adding these together gives us the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

400 bananas (monkeys) + 800 bananas (gorillas) + 200 bananas (baboons) = 1400 bananas

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/run} \times 15 \text{ runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/run} \times 34 \text{ runs} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each:

- Anakin's total: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Locsin's total: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

Adding the totals together, the combined total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is:

\[19 + 13 = 32\]

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

First, let's calculate the price after the first 2 months:
The price increase is 20% of $20, which is:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]
So, the new price after 2 months is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Next, let's calculate the price after the next 2 months (4 months total):
The price increase is 20% of $24, which is:
\[ 20\% \times 24 = 0.20 \times 24 = 4.8 \]
So, the new price after 4 months is:
\[ 24 + 4.8 = 28.8 \]

Next, let's calculate the price after the next 2 months (6 months total):
The price increase is 20% of $28.8, which is:
\[ 20\% \times 28.8 = 0.20 \times 28.8 = 5.76 \]
So, the new price after 6 months is:
\[ 28.8 + 5.76 = 34.56 \]

We can see a pattern here. The price after \(2n\) months is given by:
\[ 20 \times (1.20)^n \]
where \(n\) is the number of 2-month periods.

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we need to find the price after 18 periods:
\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, let's calculate \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

The cost of one red car is $4.
The cost of one action figure is $5.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The total cost of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
- The total cost of the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from not doing freelance work.

1. Calculate the lost income from not doing freelance work:
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour of freelance work.
   - She will be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Lost income = 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

2. Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. Determine the net difference in money:
   - Net difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Net difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the scanner is €157.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

So, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan. So, the total number of eggs required is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Adding $2 to that amount gives us $16 + $2 = $18.

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes to peel all the potatoes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds to cut all the potatoes.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
- \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes:
- Total time = time to peel + time to cut
- Total time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   - Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"Given that Bo has 40 crabs, we can determine the number of crabs Monic has. Since Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we subtract 4 from 40:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Monic has 36 crabs.

Next, we need to find out how many crabs Rani has. Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, so we add 10 to the number of crabs Monic has:

\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \]

So, Rani has 46 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

\[ 122 \]"
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was \(30 - 2 = 28\).

Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

So, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, let's calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters:
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- Therefore, the total amount of straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Now, we know that the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces. So, the straw used for the rabbits is:
- \(160 - 50 = 110\) pieces of straw for the rabbits.

Since the problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits, we can confirm that the remaining 110 pieces of straw are used for the rats.

Next, we need to find out how many rats are in each cage. We know that the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(r\). Therefore, the total number of rats is \(3r\), and the total straw used for the rats is:
- \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).

We know that the total straw used for the rats is 110 pieces, so:
- \(18r = 110\).

To find \(r\), we solve the equation:
- \(r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11\).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem implies an equal distribution, we need to recheck the interpretation. Given the context, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a need for rounding, but typically, the problem would be set up to have a whole number solution. 

However, based on the given data and the requirement for a whole number of rats, the closest whole number solution would be 6 rats per cage, with a slight discrepancy in the total straw used.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought as \( x \).

The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars.

The cost of transporting the wheat is \( 2x \) dollars.

So, the total cost for the trader is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 30x - 22x = 400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

Dividing both sides by 8:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of tickets:**
   - They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

3. **Cost of rides:**
   - They went on 2 different rides which cost $33 for each ride.
   - Total cost of rides = 2 * $33 = $66

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
   - Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

5. **Cost per person:**
   - They agreed to split all the costs evenly among the 3 friends.
   - Cost per person = Total cost / 3
   - Cost per person = $102 / 3 = $34

So, each of them paid $34."

"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks in the flock.
Total weekly requirement = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.
Daily requirement = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. He starts with 50 trees.

3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

4. After 10 years, the total number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 70% of the trees survive. The number of trees that survive is \(130 \times 0.70 = 91\) trees.

Therefore, the final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. So, they took 6 pink flamingos and painted them white. This leaves 12 pink flamingos in Sue's front yard.
3. Then, on Saturday morning, the neighbors put the 6 white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard. So, at this point, there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. This means there are now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40

"To get an average of 93 over six tests, Brinley needs to have a total of \(93 \times 6 = 558\) points across all six tests, because the average is the total sum of scores divided by the number of tests.

Brinley's current total from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

To find out what she needs on the sixth test, we subtract her current total from the required total:

\[558 - 438 = 120\]

However, since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, Brinley should aim to remove the lowest score from her first five tests before adding the sixth test score. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71.

So, if Brinley removes 71 from her total, her new total becomes \(438 - 71 = 367\).

To achieve an average of 93, she needs a total of 558 points. Therefore, the score she needs on the sixth test is:

\[558 - 367 = 191\]

So, Brinley needs to score 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did in total is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's say Sara mows the lawn \( x \) times. She earns $4 each time, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"To find Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she promised to return, which is the borrowed amount plus 10% of the borrowed amount.

1. Calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 200 \]

2. Add this to the borrowed amount to find the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

3. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
\[ 165 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1980 \]

4. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, if Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, the total travel time will be:

6 days (bus trip) + 3 days (car trip) = 9 days.

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

- Initial number of fire type cards: 30
- Initial number of grass type cards: 20
- Initial number of water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the new total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{32}{96} \]

To find the percentage, we multiply the probability by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 33 \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he added to the base burrito and then subtract the value of the gift card.

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark has 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, she collects 2 * 25 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

Therefore, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs would be:

50 ants / 2 = 25 bugs

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens (since 25 / 5 = 5).
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the first cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the second cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the third cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.
6. **Fifth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fourth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has 25 pens again. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens again.

After the fifth cycle, he will have 5 new pens plus the 20 pens that were not used up in the fifth cycle (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he will have 25 pens again, but he will not be able to make any more new pens because he will have less than 5 pens left.

So, the total number of pens he will have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the new pens he made in each cycle:

\[ 25 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

\[
\boxed{40}

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C from the remaining students after exit B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit A} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C from the remaining students after exit B.
   \[
   \text{Remaining students after exit B} = 700 - 420 = 280

"Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can determine how many candies Robert has:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which also totals 3 books.

So, collectively, they will read:

Dolly's total: 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books
Pandora's total: 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books

Adding these together, the total number of books read by both of them is:

3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books

Final numerical answer:
6"
"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each person sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).

Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 30 pages (3 people * 10 pages).

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages a week in response.

The total number of pages Mike writes in a week is 60 pages (30 pages received + 30 pages written).

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is 360 minutes (60 pages * 6 minutes per page).

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

360 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours

So, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week."
"Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. He makes a 15-minute call with his boss every day, and this month has 30 days. So, the total minutes used for these calls is:

15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people. So, the total minutes used this month is:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual expenses:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days is \(20 + 26 = 46\).

The total number of cookies her sister ate over the two days is \(5 + 13 = 18\).

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed is \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The total calories her sister consumed is \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) girls in total.

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, so the new total number of cows is:

\[ 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows} \]

Now, these 240 cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Since we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 12 \times 8 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 96 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill he has and then sum them up.

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the redwood weighs 5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time it took to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat it to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."

2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Now, add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."

"To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1. Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, and each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, for step 2, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

For step 3, we know that each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:
\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice Ann's age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money she has in cents:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents
- 5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
- 1 dime = 10 cents
- 2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

So, the total amount of money Kelly has is:
125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, the amount of money she will have left is:
145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

Final answer: 90 cents"
"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars used in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of stars used in these 5 rows:
\(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars. To find the number of stars that are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the 36 stars from the total:
\(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

Now, to find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the 40 stars by 5:
\(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

The distance is 480 miles, and the speed is 30 miles per hour. Plugging in these values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ali has won 22 medals.
2. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.
3. Together, Ali and Izzy have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.
4. The problem states that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

Let \(M\) be the total number of medals given out for counting. According to the problem, \(M = 10 \times 39\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, let's first determine the total time she works.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we convert 2.5 hours into minutes to match the rate at which she earns money:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10 and then multiply by $5:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

15 * $5 = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points for all three players are:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

Final numerical answer:

- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total count of activities for the two days:

First day total:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20
Total for the first day = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

Second day total:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40
Total for the second day = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

Total count of activities for the two days = 170 + 200 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and eating rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.
2. Determine the total weekly rice consumption.
3. Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total daily rice consumption for the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, each person consumes:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \]

For 5 members of the household, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total weekly rice consumption.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people, making a total of 4 bids.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for the driving service is $31,800."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold in the first and current year is \(90 + 45 = 135\).
7. Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 135 = 65\).

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\).

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which Sandy loses weight:

If 4 weeks = 2 pounds, then \( x \) weeks = 8 pounds.

So, \( x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 16 \text{ weeks} \).

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits and suitcases:

- Business suits: 6 suits * $100 each = $600
- Suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50 each = $150

Next, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500. So, the flight ticket costs:

- Flight ticket: $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:

- Total cost so far: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $2050

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles. Then we have:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

At the beginning, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left."
"The book costs $4. 

The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$1 \]"
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. We don't need to know the exact number of pencils in each box to solve this problem, as we are only concerned with the total number of pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

So, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Now, we need to determine how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that 3 boxes are sufficient for Jam to store 24 pencils (26 total - 2 loose pencils), we can assume that each box can hold at least 8 pencils (24 pencils / 3 boxes).

To find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9 boxes"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we need to account for the 15 milliliters of cream added. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add this to the weakening from the ice cubes:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly pay is:

\[ \text{Monthly pay for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We are given that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

40 percentage points × 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \]

This means they earned $4 off their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the reward is $4, the coupon took:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total discount from the reward and the coupon is:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

Subtracting this total discount from the $43 spent gives:
\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles.
2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Final numerical answer:
44"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Jason (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people (DJ, Nick, Jason, and Richard), so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
2. Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.
3. Add the two amounts together.

For 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- So, 8 batches will require \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

For 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- So, 1 batch will require 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, add the two amounts together:
- \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces of sugar.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.
3. Find the total value of all shares at the end of the second year.

**Step 1: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.**

Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ 8 + 0.5 \times 8 = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars per share} \]

The value of the 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ 12 - 0.25 \times 12 = 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ dollars per share} \]

The value of the 8 shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
The final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ 72 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

The animals have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh starts with juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

The total weight of the animals is:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds.

Adding the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
240 + 20 = 260 pounds.

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Since Jenny buys 36 cookies a week, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to get the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the costs for each item and then sum them up for a year.

1. **Food Cost:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
   - For a year, the cost for food is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for treats is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Medicine Cost:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - For a year, the cost for medicine is \(100 \times 12 = 1200\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:

\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). Therefore, we have:

3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (including herself) is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, subtract this from her budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
$90 (budget) - $30 (Morgan's expenses) = $60

Since each friend will also have the same expenses, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per person:
$60 / $30 = 2

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She spends 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each, so the total cost of the lollipops is:

4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

The amount she saves each day is the difference between her pocket money and the cost of the lollipops:

$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is:

$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. We know he spent half of his change on gumballs, and he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.

2. Calculate the cost of 40 gumballs:
   \[
   40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2
   \]

3. Since the $2 was half of his change, his total change after buying the candy was:
   \[
   2 \times \$2 = \$4
   \]

4. Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$4 = \$6
   \]

5. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

Final answer: 25"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing for a collie bed:**
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds.

4. **Add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:**
   - Total stuffing = stuffing for chihuahua beds + stuffing for collie beds
   - Total stuffing = \(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"To calculate the total time John's trip took, we need to calculate the time for each leg of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **First Leg (to his friend's house):**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles detour = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Return Leg (back home):**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Total Time:**
- Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the minimum total of 42 points.

Jane's scores so far are:
- First test: 15 points
- Second test: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
15 + 18 = 33 points

To find out the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the total points she has from the required total:
42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass. 

Minimum points needed on the third test: 9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   31 + x = 50
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 50 - 31 = 19

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has now.
2. Subtract the points Erin scored from her current total to find out how many points she had before.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara scored 8 points, so three times Sara's points is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means Erin now has 24 points. Since she scored 14 points to reach this total, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting 14 from 24:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames = $1056
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

"To find out how much Ethan would save by making his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the market price and then subtract that from the original price.

The market price of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

The total cost for Ethan to make his own wallpaper would be the original price minus the savings:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, produce 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, produce 2 kg of milk each day.

So, the total milk collected from the first half is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

And the total milk collected from the second half is:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding these together gives the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. After feeding her 6 children with one each, she had:

6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, she fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 40 pupils in the class.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.
3. The remaining pupils are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. The rest of the pupils like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To find out how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, let's break down the information given:

1. Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56, and each apple is sold at $4.
2. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
3. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.

First, we calculate the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday:
\[ \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money from Monday}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

Next, we know the number of apples picked on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of apples on Tuesday} = 12 \]

And the number of apples picked on Wednesday is double the number picked on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add up the apples picked over the three days:
\[ \text{Total apples} = \text{Apples on Monday} + \text{Apples on Tuesday} + \text{Apples on Wednesday} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate would be:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \frac{\text{Time in months}}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment Karan has to make is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue. The cost of supplies is $18, so:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

This is the total profit over the 9 hours. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 - 30 = $6 \]

So, David saves $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap.

Monica has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, we get:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services after the 20% discount for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so without the discount, the total cost for both would be:
\[ $10 + $10 = $20 \]

With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20% of $20:
\[ 20\% \times $20 = 0.20 \times $20 = $4 \]

So, the discounted cost for both Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ $20 - $4 = $16 \]

Adding the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month, the total cost for the streaming services is:
\[ $16 + $10 = $26 \]

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 a month. By switching to the streaming services, he saves:
\[ $60 - $26 = $34 \]

"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100

1. First, we need to determine the total number of slots available in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of books \( x \) is:
   \[
   x = 2 \times 36 + 20
   \]

3. Now, we calculate the value of \( x \):
   \[
   x = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92
   \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{92}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
3. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, so she passed out a total of \(24 + 5 = 29\) cards.
4. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

- Initial cards made by Erica: 20
- Cards from her dad: 30
- Total cards before passing out: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Cards passed out: 29
- Cards received: 17

So, the final number of cards Erica has is:
\[50 - 29 + 17 = 38\]

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Jenny starts with 12 slices of pizza.

First, she gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away and eaten:
\[ 4 \text{ (to Bill)} + 3 \text{ (to Mark)} + 2 \text{ (Jenny eats)} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the final number of slices left is:

"Nancy saw 90 spiders.

The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so:
\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so:
\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

Total number of bugs: 168"
"To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Beth's age.
2. Determine Alice's age.
3. Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages.

Given that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Next, since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

Now, to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total amount of milk he drinks is:

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of weeks the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the monthly earnings.
4. Multiply the monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to get the annual earnings.

Step 1: The builder works for 4 weeks every month.

Step 2: The builder works for 6 days every week. Therefore, the number of days the builder works in a month is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Step 3: The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, the monthly earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$1200/\text{month} \]

Step 4: There are 12 months in a year, so the annual earnings are:
\[ \$1200/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$14400/\text{year} \]

Therefore, the builder earns \(\$14400\) in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags of flour needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles of milk needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Energy Consumption:**
   - Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   - Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.
   - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: 7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.

2. **Reduced Energy Consumption:**
   - If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day.
   - Energy used per day = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.
   - Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours: 2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.

3. **Daily Savings:**
   - Daily savings = Initial energy consumption - Reduced energy consumption
   - Daily savings = 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours per day.

4. **Total Savings Over 30 Days:**
   - Total savings = Daily savings * 30 days
   - Total savings = 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

Therefore, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, he needs to make:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:

- \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \)
- \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \)

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost will be:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together, the total cost will be:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend \(\$50.00\) on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:
New total cannolis = Original cannolis + Additional cannolis
New total cannolis = 40 + 60
New total cannolis = 100

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so the new number of corns is:
New number of corns = Original corns - 40
New number of corns = 80 - 40
New number of corns = 40

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:
Combined total = New total cannolis + New number of corns
Combined total = 100 + 40
Combined total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog and then subtract that from the total steps he aimed to take.

Total steps aimed to take: 10,000 steps

Steps taken before the jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000 steps
- Short walk with his friend: 1,000 steps

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps

So, the steps taken during the jog would be the difference between the total steps aimed to take and the sum of the steps taken before the jog and the steps left after the jog.

Steps taken during the jog: 10,000 - (6,000 + 2,000) = 10,000 - 8,000 = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" So, for 2 pounds, Sally pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound.

The cost for the first pound of taffy is $3.
The cost for the second pound of taffy is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. The total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400. So, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price. So, we calculate 80% of $1200:

\[ 1200 \times 0.80 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

First, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are considered ""more dangerous"" and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of these candles have this defect, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

The problem does not provide information about the percentage of candles that explode, so we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, based on the information given, we can only conclude that 2,500 candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Since the problem does not give us the percentage of candles that explode, we cannot provide a numerical answer for the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

Final numerical answer: 
\[ \text{Insufficient information to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of one discounted blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses. So, the total cost for 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \( x \).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute \( d \) in the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can find \( d \) using the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

Final numerical answer:

"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.

So, the total amount from the banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\) dollars.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get:
\[5000 + 12000 = 17000\]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has \(\boxed{17000}\) dollars in capital."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of this total from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means the savings from the tattered jeans is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 more than the sale price, so:

\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. So, we need to find the difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans:

\[ J - T = 24 - 28 = -4 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, we take the absolute value of the difference:

\[ |24 - 28| = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

2. The 6 minibusses can each hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards. The money he gets from selling these cards is \( \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash, which means the money he got from selling the cards minus the $100 for the ticket leaves him with $50. So, we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 - 100 = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = \frac{2}{3}x \times \frac{3}{2} = x \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ x - 100 = 50 \]

Adding 100 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog.

2. The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

4. Since there were only 54 hot dogs prepared, and 40 guests each wanted a second hot dog, we need to see how many of those second hot dogs can be provided:
   - 54 hot dogs - 40 hot dogs (first hot dog for each guest) = 14 hot dogs left for seconds

5. Since 40 guests wanted a second hot dog and only 14 were available, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
   - 40 guests - 14 hot dogs = 26 guests

So, the final numerical answer is:
26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. 

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the discount amount:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost before the discount to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
$132.00"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to determine how much money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora currently has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips, each costing 40 cents.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the remaining amount as:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can determine how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips and the remaining money from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

Final numerical answer:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Each person will get 7 oranges."
"To find the cost per serving, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Calculate the total cost of the soup.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount. So, he will use:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds of onions}
   \]

2. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00
   \]

3. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00
   \]

4. The total cost of the soup is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
   \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Now, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increase due to the oven is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) degrees.
3. After baking, the house's temperature is \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.
4. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, in 30 minutes, the temperature decrease is \(\frac{30}{10} \times 2 = 3\) degrees.
5. After closing the window, the house's temperature is \(55 - 3 = 52\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 52 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( x \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 4 * 12 = 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, Rozanne has a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make is 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is 10 / 5 = 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.

- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The remaining sneakers are \(48 - 17 = 31\). These were sold to a department store at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost is the cost of the entire case, which is $576. So, the profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[
\boxed{539}

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Super ticket + popcorn + soda (when buying the super ticket):
   - Super ticket: $20
   - Popcorn + soda: $1 extra
   - Total: $20 + $1 = $21

2. Regular ticket + popcorn + soda (when not buying the super ticket):
   - Regular ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket plus popcorn and soda.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 21 = 15 + x + 2 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 21 = 17 + x \]
\[ x = 21 - 17 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

5. Calculate the average speed:
   \[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She also gains 2 rubies from the trade:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.60 * 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, there are 78 cards of all mentioned colors."

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't make a fraction of a trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 60% of Frederick's plants
Toni's plants = 10 + 0.60 * 10
Toni's plants = 10 + 6
Toni's plants = 16

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7
Shondra's plants = 9

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To calculate the tip, we need to find 1/5 of the $15 pizza delivery cost.

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

So, the tip is $3.

Now, to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the cost of the pizza and the tip:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative position, we adjust this to the last place, which is 100. So, she is now in 100th place.
3. She moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she is now in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 + 3 = 101\). Again, since there are only 100 spots, we adjust this to the last place, which is 100. So, she is now in 100th place.
5. She jumped ahead 1 spot: \(100 - 1 = 99\). So, she is now in 99th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 99th place."
"Miss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of:

\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so she has a total of:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Adding the basketball and baseball cards together, she has:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, he gets 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

Starting shoes: 200
+ Monday's shoes: 10

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"To calculate the total cost of the trip, we need to consider the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel stay.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets (one for Tom and one for his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 \times 0.20 = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, the total price per day for the hotel is:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel stay is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total earned from the goal to find out how much more they need to earn:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on her player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to her player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."
"To find out the total amount of money Stetson gave up, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.
2. Determine the total amount of money given based on the number of oranges eaten.

Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 4 * 2 = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

"To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person for the venue and the food is already included, so the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. So we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Next, we solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 43 - 7\]
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each and then add them together.

First, calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, calculate the amount of yarn her grandma used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"Cherrie is buying gifts for 5 friends. 

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.
- Additionally, Cherrie decides to get 10 more random gifts.

Adding these together, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is:
10 (for the first 2 friends) + 6 (for the next 3 friends) + 10 (random gifts) = 26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can determine the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as:

Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]
\[ 2x = 7 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 4 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$144.00 \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week, so she takes a total of:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

Final numerical answer:
$2.00"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm only has 30 cows, so this statement is not relevant to the actual number of cows on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is 40 (from the farm) + 20 (from the zoo) = 60 animals.

60 animals"
"Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can determine how many Sophia bought by dividing these numbers by 4.

For onions:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

For potatoes:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. 

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

Step 1: Total calories to be burned
Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total calories to be burned is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Number of days
Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Daily calorie deficit
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to be burned by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day and worked for an entire week, which is 7 days. So, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Determine the total amount of water she needs based on the distance.

First, we calculate the total distance:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- Hannah runs 8 laps.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Next, we calculate the total amount of water:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- The total distance is 2 km.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Julie initially had $500.
2. She spent 20% of it on clothes. So, the amount spent on clothes is:
   \[
   500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 500 \times 0.20 = 100
   \]
   After buying clothes, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   500 - 100 = 400
   \]
3. She then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. So, the amount spent on CDs is:
   \[
   400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 400 \times 0.25 = 100
   \]
   After buying CDs, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   400 - 100 = 300
   \]

So, the amount of money Julie had left is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each for $4, so the total number of bags she bought is:

8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags

The total cost for the bags is:

40 bags * $4/bag = $160

She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is:

40 bags * $8/bag = $320

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

$320 - $160 = $160

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $160 on her bags."
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total number of punches based on his rate of throwing and the duration of the fight.

Joe throws 25 punches per minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total duration of the fight is:

5 rounds * 3 minutes/round = 15 minutes

Now, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total number of minutes in the fight:

25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches

So, Joe threw 375 punches in total."
"Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so:

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Final numerical answer:
18"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars. This leaves Ali with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

Subtracting the amount used for dinner from the remaining money, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is 29."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

After selling 132 loaves, the number of loaves left would be:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves.

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so the total number of loaves left would be:

3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption after adding the new device will be:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days * 2 = 10 days).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the number of days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people working together would be 5 times as fast as one person, it would take them 10 days / 5 = 2 days to paint a whole house.

To convert the number of days into hours, we multiply the number of days by the number of hours in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Given that Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:

Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 22

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:

Jenna's chairs = 3 * Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 * 22
Jenna's chairs = 66

Since Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas as chairs, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has:

Jenna's sofas = Jenna's chairs
Jenna's sofas = 66

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Total sofas = Ophelia's sofas + Jenna's sofas
Total sofas = 20 + 66
Total sofas = 86

Total chairs = Ophelia's chairs + Jenna's chairs
Total chairs = 22 + 66
Total chairs = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs = Total sofas + Total chairs
Total number of sofas and chairs = 86 + 88
Total number of sofas and chairs = 174

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one CD:
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} \]
\[ \text{Number of CDs} = 12 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 12 CDs. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and he worked out for 5 hours for two consecutive weeks and 6 hours for one week, he worked out for 4 hours in \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

So, the total hours for the 5 weeks is:
\[5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}\]

Next, we add the hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\]

And the hours for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Now, we sum all these hours together:
\[20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine Jame's current age:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. Determine Jame's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

4. Determine the cousin's current age:

"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find the cost of the printer. Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \$1,100 - \$400 = \$700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of the monitors:
\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the printer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = \$2,400 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \$1,100 + \$700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = \$2,400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ \$1,800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = \$2,400 \]

Subtract $1,800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of the monitors:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = \$2,400 - \$1,800 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = \$600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{\$600}{2} = \$300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the number of seashells each girl brought is:

60 (shells brought by the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times the number of shells brought by the boys) = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

Each girl brought 300 seashells."

"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer: Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

18 vlogs"
"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill, you will pay your share of the total bill, which is half of $60.

\[ \text{Your share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much each boy initially gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, each boy initially gets $6.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   Now, he has $11.

3. The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   Now, he has $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13
   \]
   Now, he has $13.

5. He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39
   \]
   So, he now has $39.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount saved in the first half of April is \( 15x \).

According to the problem, in the second half of April, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half. The total amount saved in the second half of April is \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the amounts saved in the first and second halves, which should equal his target of $1125. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half, he will save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Jairus gets for 20 tasks.
2. Calculate the total amount Jenny gets for 20 tasks.
3. Subtract the amount Jenny gets from the amount Jairus gets.

Step 1: Jairus's total amount
Jairus gets $0.8 for each task. For 20 tasks, he gets:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Jenny's total amount
Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. For 20 tasks, she gets:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 3: Difference in their amounts
The difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total amounts is:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day, which is a total of 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, making it 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week would be:

"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we can use the concept of exponential growth.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 3^2 = 9\) families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 3^3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 3^4 = 81\) families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and then add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight was:
70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2

   \[
   x = 398
   \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total amount Daniel has to spend, we first need to find the cost of each item he wants to buy, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he swims a mile in \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes on a hot day.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions.

On a cold day, the time for 3 miles is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

On a hot day, the time for 3 miles is \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his daily earnings are:

1. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with two holes.
2. Calculate the number of holes in the buttons with four holes.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes in these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( x \).
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups.
4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which means \( x = 4 \).

Now, we need to find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. Currently, Juan drinks \( 5x \) cups, and he needs to reduce it to 4 cups. So, the reduction needed is:

\[ 5x - 4 \]

Since \( x = 4 \):

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angle the sun makes with the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun relative to the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. After 10 hours, the sun will have moved \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

\[32 + 50 = 82\]

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

Final answer:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of pages she read in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

So, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth were $1.00 each, half of that is $0.50. So, for the last two teeth, that's 2 teeth * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days).
2. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 per day.
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. That's 4 days.
4. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10/day * 4 days = $40.
5. The number of wooden action figures he buys is $40 / $5 = 8 action figures.
6. After Wednesday, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left to spend.
7. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. That's 4 days.
8. The total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is $30.
9. The number of plastic action figures he buys is $30 / $2 = 15 action figures.

3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The final numerical answer is:

$308"
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied in a month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, the total number of roses he grows in a month is:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years and then calculate the total amount removed from the account.

1. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months.
2. Katina removes $100 from the account every month, so over 24 months, she will remove \(24 \times 100 = 2400\) dollars.
3. Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account: \(3000 - 2400 = 600\).

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

600"
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Net profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Total cost per sandwich
   - Net profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Net Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the net profit for 10 sandwiches is 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

- There are 3 boxes of crayons.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.

So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make. She uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \]

So, Kate can make 24 crayon muffins.

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kate can make $36."
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of installation} = 216 \text{ square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of new carpet} + \text{Cost of padding} + \text{Cost of removal} + \text{Cost of installation}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$2592 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is **$11232**."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds:

50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 300 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

300 birds / 7 days = 42.857142857142854 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is approximately 43 birds per day.

Average number of birds Mack saw in a day: 43"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number is calculated. Since the number is the starting value itself (20), half of 20 is 10. So, the expression becomes \(20 + 10 = 30\).
3. This resulting value (30) is then divided by 5, which gives \(30 \div 5 = 6\).
4. The resulting value (6) is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so \(20 - 12 = 8\). Therefore, the expression becomes \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

The final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let's denote the correct temperature setting as \( T \). Then:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of the price of Herb's house and then subtract that from the price of Herb's house.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

120"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts (assuming each contact is a single use and not a pair) is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speed measurements, we first need to determine the third measurement. 

Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed once more by 5 WPM, his new speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have the three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add these three measurements together and then divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and eating Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the people:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

So, Alex will need 318 seats."

\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on the daily amount.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, his daily protein intake is 6 grams. To find out how much protein he consumes in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, the cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[
   \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Final answer:

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed of the plane = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Using the speed we calculated:
Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final answer:
5 hours"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together, the total amount of chocolates they made together is:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:

\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:

\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate the earnings from each period separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}\).
- Over four hours, the total earnings were \(4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00\).

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour were \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}\).
- Over two hours, the total earnings were \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00\).

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

First, we know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation group}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/rotation group} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rotations per tire in a year (12 months):
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 20 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, we need to find the cost per single pump, so we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{2} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{30}{100} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking for the remaining amount if Joe could somehow manage to buy the items (which is not possible with the given budget), we would subtract the total cost from the amount Joe has:

\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since Joe cannot afford the items, the correct interpretation is that he will be short by $2.50. But if we are to provide the remaining amount as if the purchase was made (which is not feasible), the answer would be:

\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

So, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the previous month.
   - The cost for the 6th month is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - The cost for the 7th month is \(150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000\).
   - The cost for the 8th month is \(225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500\).
   - And so on...

To find the total cost for the remaining 5 months, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

Here, \(a = 150,000\), \(r = 1.5\), and \(n = 5\).

\[ S_5 = 150,000 \frac{1 - 1.5^5}{1 - 1.5} \]
\[ S_5 = 150,000 \frac{1 - 7.59375}{-0.5} \]
\[ S_5 = 150,000 \frac{-6.59375}{-0.5} \]
\[ S_5 = 150,000 \times 13.1875 \]
\[ S_5 = 1,978,125 \]

3. **Total cost:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: $1,978,125

\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 1,978,125 = 2,078,125 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $2,078,125."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding up the meat consumed:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

93000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry 52 * 2 = 104 times.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, Gary spends 2080 * $0.15 = $312.

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the cost of each item she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. 

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators:

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Multiply by the number of intersections to get the total number of street lights.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to get the number of functioning street lights.

Step 1: Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection.
Total street lights at one intersection = 4 street lights/pole * 6 poles = 24 street lights

Step 2: There are 4 intersections.
Total street lights for all intersections = 24 street lights/intersection * 4 intersections = 96 street lights

Step 3: 20 street lights are not working.
Functioning street lights = Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights
Functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76

The total number of functioning street lights is 76."

644 + 865 = 1509

Both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"To find the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours:

- John went to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- He went for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, for 6 weeks, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- The total number of hours is 24.

So, the total cost is:

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is:
\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

Now, subtract the total gum chewed from the initial amount:

- Remaining gum after school and after dinner: \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- Gum given to his sister: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces

Finally, subtract the gum given to his sister from the remaining gum:

- Remaining gum at the end of the day: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we first need to calculate the total amount each coach spent.

For the baseball coach:
- Number of baseballs bought: 9
- Cost per baseball: $3
- Total cost for baseballs: 9 * $3 = $27

For the basketball coach:
- Number of basketballs bought: 8
- Cost per basketball: $14
- Total cost for basketballs: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost for the baseballs from the total cost for the basketballs:
- Difference in cost: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. 

There are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for the first three days, so for those three days, it towed:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

On each of the remaining four days, it towed four fewer cars than the ten cars it towed each of the first three days, which means it towed:

\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

For the remaining four days, it towed:

\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week:

\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars it towed that week is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}

"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if Manny misses a certain number of classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, so the cost per class is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

Simplifying the left side:

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Sum the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel:
\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
1050"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost of 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these amounts together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we add the bonus to the new monthly salary to get the total monthly earnings:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply the total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\$378,000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add these times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand:
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = $1 \).

So, the more expensive brand costs \( $5 + $1 = $6 \) per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee.

The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times $6 = $42 \).

He also buys himself a donut for $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\( $42 + $2 = $44 \).

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we have the amounts of money for each person:
- Aurelia: $120
- Kassidy: $90
- Rayna: $150

To find out how much money they would each have if they decided to share their money equally, we first need to find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

Since there are 3 people, we divide the total money by 3 to find out how much each person would have:

- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the last 6 days: 3 (good, neutral, good, good)

Total good days = 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (last 6 days) = 11

Since Christina had a total of 12 good days over the past thirty days, the number of good days left in the month is:

12 (total good days) - 11 (good days already counted) = 1

So, the number of good days left in the month is 1."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final answer:
Sally has 9 books."
"To find out in how many days the bamboo will reach 600 inches in height, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the necessary height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
The current height is 20 feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the current height in inches is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
The target height is 600 inches. The current height is 240 inches, so the height increase needed is:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the necessary height.
The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total height increase needed by the daily growth rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in \boxed{12} days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12.
3. James needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.
4. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24.
5. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is 24 - 3 = 21.
7. Since 3 dogs are gone, he no longer needs those 3 toys.

Now, let's calculate the total number of toys James needs:

- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 8 more toys, so he had 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
- He then bought 12 more toys, so he had 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
- Since 3 dogs are gone, he no longer needs those 3 toys, so he needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys in total.

Final numerical answer:
21"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The initial total investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. Frances invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]

5. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. Skyler's investment is the rest of the remaining amount:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we first need to find out how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $20 per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:
$20/hour * 3 hours/day = $60/day

Over two days, Karen's earnings are:
$60/day * 2 days = $120

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
6x = 96 \times 36
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} = 16 \times 36 = 576
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group of adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults (Jack and 8 other adults).
2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of the adults to find the excess weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults.
- Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- There are 9 adults in total (Jack + 8 other adults).

Total weight of the adults = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

Step 2: Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of the adults.
- The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg.

Excess weight = Total weight of the adults - Maximum load of the elevator
Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The final numerical answer is:
20 kg"
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times together to get the total time:

Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we add the time they have already spent and subtract that from their total time:

6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is \(90 - 10 = 80\).

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is also \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the 3 hours he has before he has to eat dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time John spends on his homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Finally, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we first need to determine the cost of one candy.

From the information given:
- Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20.
- Each lollipop costs $0.40.

First, we calculate the total cost of the five lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the four candies:
\[ \$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20 \]

Now, we find the cost of one candy:
\[ \frac{\$1.20}{4 \text{ candies}} = \$0.30 \text{ per candy} \]

Now that we know the cost of one lollipop and one candy, we can calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.30 \text{ per candy} = \$3.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \$7.00 \]"
"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have saved after ten years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month.
2. Calculate the number of coins Neil saves per month.
3. Determine the total number of coins each has saved over ten years.
4. Sum the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil.

First, Rong saves 20 coins per month. 

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left(20 \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil after ten years is:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from the previous equation into the total bill equation:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). So, we have:
   - \( T = 40 + 0.6T \).

7. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.6T = 40 \),
   - \( 0.4T = 40 \),
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.4} \),
   - \( T = 100 \).

So, the total bill is $100.

8. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

1. **Cost of bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

So, Gerald received 3 parts, which is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia received 2 parts, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the speed of Martha's turtle.

Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat can run at 15 feet/second, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise.

2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

Step 1: There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Step 2: Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is \(12 \times 14\).

Now, let's calculate the total charge:

\[12 \times 14 = 168\]

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we first need to determine the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, let's assume the factory produces ice cream continuously for 48 hours. We can calculate the total production for each type of ice cream in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts of ice cream = 2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. So, for 4 scoops, she would get 2 scoops free (since 4 scoops / 2 = 2 free scoops).

Therefore, with the deal, Erin can get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream:
\[ 4 \text{ (bought)} + 2 \text{ (free)} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream.

"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."

"To calculate how much James saved, we need to determine the total cost of picking the blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking the blueberries:**
   - Base cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds picked: 30

   Total cost for picking = Base cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost for picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost for picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying the blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds picked: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds picked
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost for picking

"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

For 3 minutes with her arms down:
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

For 2 minutes with her arms raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum up the taps for both feet:

The restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Bryce and his four friends ordered a total of 5 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people (Bryce and two friends) who ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches, and then use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
   - Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches.
   - Adding the 4 inches, Topher's shoe length is \(96 + 4 = 100\) inches.

2. Use the given relationship to find the length of Bobby's shoe:
   - The length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.
   - Let \(x\) be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.
   - The relationship can be written as: \(100 = 9x + 10\).

3. Solve for \(x\):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \(100 - 10 = 9x\)
   - Simplify: \(90 = 9x\)
   - Divide both sides by 9: \(x = \frac{90}{9} = 10\)

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Let's start with step 1:
- Number of students who like to bake = 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball = 5

Total number of students who like to bake or play basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, step 2:
- Total number of students in the class = 50
- Number of students who like to play video games or play music = 50 - 15 = 35

For step 3, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
- Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
- Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

3. Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class to find the number of boys.

Step 1: Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same amount of students, we divide 80 by 2:
\[ \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Step 2: In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
\[ \text{Number of girls in each class} = 40 \times \frac{40}{100} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \]

Step 3: To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
\[ \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs she has.

- Dogs to be bathed: 8
- Cats to have their nails clipped: 5
- Birds to have their wings trimmed: 3
- Horses to be brushed: 12

Total grooming jobs = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day.

28 ÷ 7 = 4

Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total value of the cards he received.

1. **Total cost of the packs:**
   Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each.
   \[

"To find out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

For the first amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $26 per adult
- Cost for children: $12 per child
- Number of adults: 2
- Number of children: 2

Total cost for the first amusement park = (2 adults * $26) + (2 children * $12)
= $52 + $24
= $76

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $14 per adult
- Cost for children: $10 per child
- Number of adults: 2
- Number of children: 2

Total cost for the second amusement park = (2 adults * $14) + (2 children * $10)
= $28 + $20
= $48

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs to determine the savings:
Savings = Total cost for the first amusement park - Total cost for the second amusement park
= $76 - $48
= $28

So, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7).

First, let's find the daily savings:

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so his daily savings are 500 * $0.10 = $50.

Now, let's find the weekly savings:

- There are 7 days in a week.
- His weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we can determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have based on the relationships provided.

1. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean.
   - Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles = 2 * 56 = 112 marbles.

2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   - Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles = 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.

To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 3 small stickers left (30 - 27).

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 20 large buttons and 20 large stickers left (40 - 20).

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 60 small buttons and 27 small stickers from the first trade, so she has a total of 87 small buttons (60 + 27).

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 27 large buttons and 87 small buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. So, the total number of Pomeranians is \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If the total number of Pomeranians is 18, then these 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies. Let's denote the total number of Jana's puppies by \(P\). So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}P = 18
   \]
4. To find \(P\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. Since the number of cases is typically a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:

\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"

"Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which sums up to 12 hours in total for the weekend.

First, we subtract the time she spends reading:
- Time spent reading: 3 hours
- Remaining time: 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Next, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining time:
- Time spent playing video games: 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
- Time spent playing soccer: 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
- Henry needs to assemble 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Total wheels for cars = 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs to assemble 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Total wheels for motorcycles = 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
- Total wheels required = 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels required from the number of wheels in the box:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Cost for series: $1200
- Cost for older movies: $800

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by both driving and hiking. We know the time spent hiking and the average hiking speed, as well as the total time spent traveling and the average driving speed. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. The driving speed is 50 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Hiking speed} = \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent driving:**
   The total travel time is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking.
   \[
   \text{Time spent driving} = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance driven} = 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot:**
   The total distance is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{255}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level as \( T_e \).

For Ava, the number of enemies she jumps on is \( E_e + 8 \), the number of berries she collects is \( B_e + 3 \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when she finishes the level is \( T_e + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ 215 \]"
"The total cost of the four pizzas is $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total. To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we first need to determine the remaining amount for the other two pizzas.

The remaining amount is:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining amount by 2:
\[ \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

Final numerical answer:

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, and twice the usual times (which is 3 * 2 = 6 times) on 2 other days.

So, for the 5 days they ride thrice a day:
5 days * 3 rides/day = 15 rides

For the 2 days they ride twice the usual times:
2 days * 6 rides/day = 12 rides

Adding these together gives the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.
2. Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the fuel used.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week.**

Andy travels 5 miles one way to work, so the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days a week.

Total distance per week = 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used for this distance.**

Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG). So, for 50 miles, the amount of fuel used is:

Fuel used = Total distance / Fuel efficiency = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel used.**

The current price for regular gas is $3 per gallon. So, the cost of the fuel used per week is:

Cost = Fuel used * Price per gallon = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15/week

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week on gas for his commute to work."
"Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of money she received:

- The total amount from the twenties is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- The total amount from the quarters is \(140 \times 0.25 = 35\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she received is \(200 + 35 = 235\) dollars.

Next, we need to calculate how much she spent:

- She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties, which is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120\) dollars.
- She spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars.

So, the total amount she spent is \(120 + 35 = 155\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:

155

155 dollars."
"Ricardo can get 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes from his tomato plants.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we can calculate the number of smart TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Next, one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so the number of analog TVs sold is:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 25 \]

So, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John still needs to raise.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he still needs to raise.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school's contribution is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
3. The amount John still needs to raise is the total cost minus the school's contribution:
   \[
   300 - 150 = 150
   \]
4. John already has $50, so the amount he is still missing is:
   \[
   150 - 50 = 100
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}

"To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature inside the house needs to be at least 32 degrees. 

During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. During the night, it is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the temperature at night would be:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, we calculate the difference in temperature and then divide by the temperature increase per log:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells:

\[ \text{Number of groups that brought seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, so the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial workforce is 200 employees, and with the new hires, the total workforce after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the total monthly salary by 3:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.68 \times 100 = 68\%

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after ordering more and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Total candies after ordering more: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200 candies
2. Candies sold: 150

Now, subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies:

200 (total candies) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the additional number of students that joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals she initially has:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Next, she drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals she initially had:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used or lost is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Since they want to make S'mores with the remaining marshmallows and they are sharing equally, each kid can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time is 240 minutes.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

2. **First Friend's Game Time:**
   - This friend can play for half as long as Jack, so 10 minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for this friend is \( \frac{240}{2} = 120 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters this friend uses is \( \frac{120}{10} = 12 \) quarters.

3. **Second Friend's Game Time:**
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so 30 minutes per quarter.
   - The total game time for this friend is \( \frac{240}{1.5} = 160 \) minutes.
   - The number of quarters this friend uses is \( \frac{160}{30} \approx 5.33 \) quarters. Since you can't use a fraction of a quarter, we round up to 6 quarters.

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - The first friend uses 12 quarters.
   - The second friend uses 6 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 12 + 6 = 30 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 30 quarters."
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil used:
\[ \text{Oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil."
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. 

The total cost for the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

The total cost for the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

The total amount of money John spent is:

"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\) dollars."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes:
720"
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Total earnings for the week
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from both games: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins.
\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the original cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The original cost of the book is $32.
   - The net loss is the original cost minus the refund plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from the amount of money she has gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Monthly recording time = 288 minutes.
- Monthly writing time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Monthly makeup time = 360 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok in a month = 288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This cost is $129.00.

2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. Since the base installation already includes 4 mirrors and 1 chandelier, we need to calculate the additional items:
   - Additional mirrors: 6 - 4 = 2 mirrors
   - Additional chandeliers: 2 - 1 = 1 chandelier
   - Additional pictures: 20 - 10 = 10 pictures

3. The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item. So, we calculate the cost for the additional items:
   - Cost for additional mirrors: 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
   - Cost for additional chandeliers: 1 * $15.00 = $15.00
   - Cost for additional pictures: 10 * $15.00 = $150.00

4. Adding the base installation cost and the cost for additional items:
   - Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela to have her items installed/hung is $224.00."
"Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved:

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]

Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of four turtles}} \]

Since the speed of four turtles is \(4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v\), the time \(T\) is:
\[ T = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it will take four turtles to cross the highway is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, which totals $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika now needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is $400 - $50 = $350.
5. To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the $230 she has from other sources from the total amount she has, which is $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
\[ 15 \]"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:

10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

Final numerical answer:
180"
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 8 (students good at English only) = 12 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (students good at math only) + 12 (students good at both math and English) = 17 students good at math.

Final numerical answer:
17"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups to perform = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform by dividing the available time by the time each group takes:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest rate and then apply it to the principal amount over the given period.

The annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which means:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical for simple interest calculations, as it would imply an unrealistic scenario. Typically, interest rates are expressed as a decimal, and 225% would be 2.25 in decimal form. Assuming this is the correct interpretation, we can proceed with the calculation.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal = $300
- Rate = 2.25 (225% as a decimal)
- Time = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - Half of the 40 white shirts have collars.
   - So, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

2. **White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 have collars, the remaining white shirts have no collars.
   - So, \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts have no collars.

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts with No Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 have buttons, the remaining floral shirts have no buttons.
   - So, \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts have no buttons.

5. **Difference between Floral Shirts with No Buttons and White Shirts with No Collars:**
   - We need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars.
   - So, \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

**Final Answer:**

"The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs / 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

If he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total earnings will be:

30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sold 2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

Step 1: James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Step 2: James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - So, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

"Let's denote your age as \( A \), your brother's age as \( B \), and your sister's age as \( S \).

From the information given, we can write the following equations:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \)
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \)
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \)
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \):

From equation 1: \( B = A + 3 \)
From equation 2: \( S = A - 2 \)

Now, substitute \( B \) and \( S \) into the sum equation:

\[ A + (A + 3) + (A - 2) + (3(A + 3) - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ A + A + 3 + A - 2 + 3A + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6A + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 6A = 78 \]

Divide by 6:

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
Mr. Jackson has 27 students and wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks per pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7. This will ensure he has enough glue sticks and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of newly infected people doubles every day in terms of the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, after three days, the total number of people infected is **3430**."

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180

Next, we know that he plans to sell these chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost price of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[
\text{Cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses Mitchell sold.

The total number of glasses sold by Julie and the boys is 32. Subtracting the 14 glasses sold by Julie, we get:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell together.

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses each of them sold:

18 / 2 = 9 glasses sold by each of Micah and Mitchell.

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure, so the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. She spent 3/4 as much as the manicure on a pedicure, so the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah is selling:
   - The rope is 20 meters long.
   - The price per meter is $2.
   - Total cost = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

2. Calculate the cost of the new rope Sarah plans to buy:
   - The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
   - Since Sarah is using the profit from selling the rope to buy the new one, we need to know the length of the new rope. However, the problem does not specify the length of the new rope. For the sake of this problem, let's assume Sarah buys a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.
   - Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

3. Calculate the profit Sarah makes from selling the rope:
   - Profit = Total cost of the rope - Cost of the new rope.
   - Profit = $40 - $30 = $10.

So, after Sarah buys the new rope, she will have $10 left over."
"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( y \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."

"To find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones were actually paired.
3. Divide the number of paired microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs.

Let's start with step 1. The singer has 50 microphones, and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Next, we move to step 2. We subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total 50 microphones:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, 40 microphones were actually paired.

Finally, for step 3, we divide the 40 microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage."

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, let's denote the payment per lawn mowing as \( p \).

From the information given, we know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since Joe's lawn was mowed \( x \) times, we can write:
\[ x \cdot p = 6 \]

Now, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ (3x + 5x) \cdot p = 8x \cdot p \]

Since \( x \cdot p = 6 \), we can substitute \( 6 \) for \( x \cdot p \):
\[ 8x \cdot p = 8 \cdot 6 = 48 \]

So, Tasha made $48 from mowing lawns. Since she made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $32 from lemonade sales."

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup in total, and he needs to serve 2 child bowls for lunch. This leaves him with 2 child bowls of soup as leftovers.

Since there are 2 children, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we sum the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then determine the initial amount each girl had.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since 2 balloons cost $0.5, 12 balloons would cost \(12 \div 2 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Total revenue = 300 lollipops * $0.8/lollypop = $240.

Step 3: Total cost of buying the lollipops
- Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
- Total cost = 300 lollipops * $0.5/lollypop = $150.

Step 4: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $240 - $150 = $90.

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby can eat 2 slices a day. Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, which means Josh can eat 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in a day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years, starting from her 5th birthday. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday.

From her 5th to her 10th birthday is a span of 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected:

60 shells

"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the 9 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. The total calories from all the pastries are:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:

- Balloons given by Maria: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Balloons given by her mom: 15

Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15 = 24

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"To find out how many new tables the charity group needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of boxes donated by the 10 people:

   \]

2. Add the 10 boxes they already have:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Determine how many tables are needed to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables}
   \]

The charity group needs \(\boxed{15}\) new tables."
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these two totals.

- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets produced by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per month: 43,200
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per month: 32,400
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he wants to deposit $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he spends $10 on 5 pencils:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours
3. The parts charge: $60

First, we calculate the labor charge. Since the charge is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, we multiply:

\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Next, we add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge:

\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, the total charge for the job is:

\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 CDs:

He initially spent $90 and then sold 5 CDs for a total of $200, so he gained $200 - $90 = $110 from selling the CDs.

Therefore, the net amount James was out is the initial cost minus the money he gained from selling the CDs:

$90 - $110 = -$20

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $20, not that he was out any money. However, if the question is asking how much money he was out in a negative scenario (like if he had to buy back the CDs), the answer would be $20.

Final numerical answer:
$20"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
5. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to swim that distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Sum up all the times to get the total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of paper thickness. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, one sheet of paper contributes to two pages in the book.

To find the total number of pages, we can multiply the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages per inch and then multiply by 2 (because each sheet of paper has two sides):

\[ \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total pages} = 300 \]

So, the book has 300 pages."
"To find out how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert 15 hours into 15-minute intervals. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the number of 15-minute intervals in 15 hours by dividing 15 hours by 0.25 hours (since 15 minutes is 0.25 of an hour):

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \div 0.25 \text{ hours/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Now, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, to find the total number of reports he stapled, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before sleepwalking:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
   - Her usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(38 - 15 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Total time asleep = Time awake before sleepwalking + Time asleep after sleepwalking
   - Time asleep after sleepwalking = Total usual sleep duration - Time sleepwalking
   - Time asleep after sleepwalking = \(480 - 23 = 457\) minutes
   - Total time asleep = \(475 + 457 = 932\) minutes

5. **Calculate the time Kim slept on her bed:**
   - Time slept on her bed = Total time asleep - Time sleepwalking
   - Time slept on her bed = \(932 - 23 = 909\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 909 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. Since he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has:

\]

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons remaining}
\]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils}
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is:
\[ 2 \]

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the pirates dug \(\boxed{11}\) holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure."
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the others. So, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person received:

\[ 70 + 70 + 85 \]

\[ = 140 + 85 \]

\[ = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office party) + 48 (from surprise party) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over from the entire day is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten during the surprise party) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

**Total age: 30**"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the total time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones gives us the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. Since the total number of cherries is 60, the number of cherries that Jerry has is \(60 - 50 = 10\).

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday:
- Apple pie sold on Saturday: 15 (Sunday) - 4 = 11 boxes.

**Total sales for each day:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

**Calculating earnings:**
- Gingerbread cost: $6 per box
- Apple pie cost: $15 per box

**Saturday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

**Sunday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to cover that amount.

First, let's find out how much sunscreen Pamela uses in one day. She reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and is outside for 4 hours a day. So, the amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen she will use over 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen. We do this by dividing the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. Therefore, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 - 6 = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size \(5 \times 5 = 25\) boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in inches, we'll convert the length of the flower bed to inches as well.

1 foot = 12 inches
111 feet = 111 * 12 = 1332 inches

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (or 18 inches) between each plant. So, the total space taken by one plant and the space between it and the next plant is:
12 inches (plant) + 18 inches (space) = 30 inches

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 1332 inches of the flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up:
1332 inches / 30 inches per plant = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means 44 plants can fit in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
44 - 17 = 27

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
27 * $6 = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week, there are 7 days, so his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels in a week} \]

Final numerical answer:
63"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for all 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3 roses"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs each month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy every 2 months by the number of 2-month periods in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp as follows:

\[ \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. We know that she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, the rate at which she sautés shrimp is:

\[ \text{Rate of sauté} = \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ shrimp/minute} \]

To find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp, we use the rate of sauté:

\[ \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on low: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)

2. The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling on high: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)

3. Afterward, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

4. Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Final answer:
14 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, we can use this information to find out when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the second time Bill saw the Comet would be 75 years after his dad saw it. So, if Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the Comet, Bill saw it 75 years later.

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Since Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it, we can find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time by subtracting 75 years from 90 years.

So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes \(\boxed{52}\) checks per year."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means that the remaining one-quarter of the flights are split equally between France and Germany, so each of these destinations gets one-eighth of the total flights.

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{1}{2} F \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

Now, we know the first plane makes 88 flights in one day. The number of flights to France is one-eighth of the total flights:
\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

So, \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam's mother gave him $6.
- Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = $12\).
- The total cost of the trousers is $30.

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to add the amounts given by his mother and father and then subtract this total from the cost of the trousers.

So, the total amount given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = $18\).

Now, subtract this from the cost of the trousers: \(30 - 18 = $12\).

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \( H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \).

First, substitute the known values of \( A \) and \( B \) into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, substitute the known values of \( A \), \( B \), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4} \]
\[ 4H = 14 + 2H + 2W \]
\[ 2H = 14 + 2W \]
\[ H = 7 + W \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( H + W = 13 \)
2. \( H = 7 + W \)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[ (7 + W) + W = 13 \]
\[ 7 + 2W = 13 \]
\[ 2W = 6 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

The amount collected from neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. So, the total amount collected from these sources is:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Walter's friend is going to give him an additional $200. So, the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2200. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be:

\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

So, the lawyer is going to contribute:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of one adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent on inpatient rounds:
   - He has 9 inpatients.
   - Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

2. Time spent on appointments:
   - He has 10 appointments.
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

3. Convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to hours:
   - Total time for inpatient rounds = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
   - Total time for appointments = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

4. Calculate the total time spent on all activities:
   - Total time spent = 3 hours (inpatient rounds) + 5 hours (appointments) = 8 hours.

5. Subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available:
   - Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up the total time required for each step and then subtract that from the desired completion time of 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time required = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready to serve at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."

2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 55.8\% \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final numerical answer:

"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces. 

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 78 \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia had, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pictures are in each album.
2. Calculate the total number of selfies.
3. Calculate the total number of portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums with the same number of pictures in each album. So, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits. So, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkout: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkout: 76 - 15 = 61
- Guests after afternoon check-in: 61 + 30 = 91
- Guests after dinner check-in: 91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 12."
"The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in one week (7 days), he eats \(5 \times 7 = 35\) sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in one week, she eats \(4 \times 7 = 28\) sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in one week, he eats \(2 \times 7 = 14\) sandwiches.

To find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week, we add the amounts together:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - If the normal teacher gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 0%

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - If Marcus does not get a personal extension, he has to turn in his homework.
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

0.5 (substitute teacher) + 0.2 (normal teacher with extension) + 0.24 (normal teacher without extension, no personal extension) = 0.94

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 94%.

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the number of bottles is one more than the number of intervals:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it will take Richard to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- So, the total cost is \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money Amor will have left:
- Amor starts with $50.
- She spends $40 on cheese.
- So, the money left is \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is $10."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take for him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to find out how long it would take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 he would have earned without college.
   - Total amount to be earned = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

4. **Calculate the time it would take to earn the total amount:**
   - Annual income with college degree = $75,000.
   - Time to earn $300,000 = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet of fabric} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. Now, we sum up the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total number of people living in these cities.

Step 1: There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Step 2: Each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To calculate the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
- There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
- So, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
- The painters worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- So, the number of hours worked per day by the team is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9\) hours.
- Over 21 days, the total hours worked by the team is \(21 \times 9 = 189\) hours.

Step 3: Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.
- There are 4 painters.
- So, the hours each painter worked is \(\frac{189}{4} = 47.25\) hours.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms and eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

Half of them are written in English, so there are \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) English books.

10% of them are written in German, so there are \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \) German books.

The rest are written in Spanish. So, the number of Spanish books is \( 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \).

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Tank top: $10
2. Running shorts: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. Tennis shoes: originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. Athletic socks: $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles are required to cover the 200 square feet area and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is 1 square foot. Therefore, to cover 200 square feet, you would need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost would be:

200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new tiles would be $2400."
"First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident.

The normal cost is $120 a month. The insurance cost increased by 60%, so we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is $192.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads for the twin sheets.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load for the king sheet.

So, Greg does 8 + 1 = 9 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, took:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down the charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, so the total cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the total cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."

"To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate.
2. Calculate how many pizzas the football team ate.
3. Subtract the number of pizzas eaten by both groups from the total number of pizzas ordered.

First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them.
- 70% of 20 is \( 0.70 \times 20 = 14 \) pizzas.

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) pizzas.
- They ate 80% of them.
- 80% of 40 is \( 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \) pizzas.

Now, let's find out how many pizzas are left:
- The glee club ate 14 pizzas, and the football team ate 32 pizzas.
- Together, they ate \( 14 + 32 = 46 \) pizzas.

"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of $245 on postage."

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons."
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets a second pound at half the price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound. So, for the first pound, he pays $4.00, and for the second pound, he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Therefore, for every 2 pounds of butter, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

- For the first 2 pounds, he pays $6.00.
- For the next 2 pounds, he pays another $6.00.
- For the last 2 pounds, he pays another $6.00.

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $6.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $18.00.

"To determine the cost of Kayla's party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who couldn't come.
3. Determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the rental fee and the additional guests.

Let's start with the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the number of guests who couldn't come:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional guests there are beyond the initial 20:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the theater rental is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each of the 21 additional guests. So, the cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Finally, we add the rental fee to the cost of the additional guests to get the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.
3. There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
- Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write the equation as:

\[7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315\]

Simplify the equation:

\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[24 + x = 45\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can find the cost of a single rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the cost of 15 roses by multiplying the cost of one rose by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change she should receive is the difference between the amount she brought and the cost of the roses:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

Final answer:
\[ 25 \]"

2. Burger platters: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
3. Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

Now, we add all the amounts together:

$33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs after 30 minutes (10 minutes arrival + 20 minutes stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs, which is 60 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 minutes / 4).
   - Departs after 65 minutes (60 minutes arrival + 5 minutes stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the second train departs, which is 130 minutes after the first train arrives.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 130 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 150 minutes after the first train arrives.

Paul will board the fourth train at 150 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 150 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
150 minutes"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to collect is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks."
"To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount from the original price.

**Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.**

The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.**

Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

**Step 3: Determine the discount from the original price.**

The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend bought it for $1800. The discount is the difference between the original price and the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid.

\[ \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To find out how many jellyfish 5 springs would create in 4 hours, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. First, determine how many seconds are in 4 hours.
2. Then, calculate how many jellyfish one spring would create in that time.
3. Finally, multiply the number of jellyfish one spring creates by the number of springs.

Let's start with step 1:

1. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 4 hours in total.
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. Since every second a new jellyfish is created by one spring, in 14400 seconds, one spring would create 14400 jellyfish.

3. Now, we multiply the number of jellyfish one spring creates by the number of springs (5):
   \[
   14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} \times 5 \text{ springs} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
   \]

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference in cost between buying individually and buying in bunches:
- The cost of buying individually is $32.
- The cost of buying in bunches is $30.
- The savings is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**

   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Half of them were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
   - 15% were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
   - The rest were MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**

   - Price of one MTB: $500
   - Price of one BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Price of one Trekking: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

3. **Sum up the earnings to get the total:**

   - Total earnings: \( 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \)

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer will make:

\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up:

\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field is:

12"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time:
\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 + 200 = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its initial height:
\[ \text{Height after first bounce} = 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce:
\[ \text{Height after second bounce} = 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Converting \(\frac{32}{3}\) to a decimal gives approximately 10.67 feet.

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we first need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

The orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas and shakes 3 of them.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 sodas in total.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets one of the 2 shaken sodas out of the remaining 7 sodas.

The probability is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{7} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{7} \times 100 \approx 28.57\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 28.57%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off.
3. Calculate the number of days he works.
4. Calculate the total number of people he helps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days he works.**

- Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - The amount saved each year is $20,000.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years.

\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total school population, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total school population by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total school population is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to calculate the number of days in June and then determine how many miles she needs to hike each day to meet her goal.

June has 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to walk:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

To find out the total miles she plans to walk in June:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Soledad's goal is to walk 9,300 miles, but her current plan only allows her to walk 7,500 miles. The difference is:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from red balls:
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. Calculate the revenue from blue balls:
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. Calculate the revenue from green balls:
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls:
   - Total revenue: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

So, James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became:

-6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how much each of the books cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount spent so far: $4
3. Amount left in the budget: $2
4. Number of books bought: 2
5. Cost of each book: Let's call it \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much Anna spent on the books today. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from the total amount she had after her initial spending:

\[ \text{Amount spent on books today} = \text{Initial amount spent} - \text{Amount left} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on books today} = 4 - 2 = 2 \]

Since she bought 2 books and spent a total of $2, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books:

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent on books today}}{\text{Number of books}} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

So, each book cost $1.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, we add this increase to the original number of students:

50 + 10 = 60

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

We need to find the time it takes for 459 blinks.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we use this rate to find the time for 459 blinks:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's garden pond, and then add the new ones he buys.

- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

**Total Male Fishes:**
- Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 6 + 5 = 11

**Total Female Fishes:**
- Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 8 + 8 = 16

**Difference Between Female and Male Fishes:**
- Female fishes - Male fishes = 16 - 11 = 5

**Final Answer:**
Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes."
"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours. So, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours. So, Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours to do the laundry (since ""over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, and we can assume the minimum of 5 hours for the calculation).

To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we add up the time each person took:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{mph} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives a total of 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by the first four workers, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

105 pounds"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Let's say Seth had \( x \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{x}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers. This means Luis gave the rest to Kris, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
4. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
5. Since Kris received \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{4} = 16 \).
6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

Final numerical answer:
64"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day to find the number of days.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get the total weight in ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we have:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree:

\[ 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be cut from the 64 feet of usable wood:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, John cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from all the logs is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

If he sells each plank for $1.2, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2/\text{plank} = \$96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$96 \]"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Since Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

The combined salary of Valerie and her brother is $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

Final numerical answer:
45000"
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of her walk is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, we have:

\[ 2 \text{ miles} = v \times 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk portion of her walk is 1 mile. Using her speed on the sidewalk, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\)

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\)

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Now, we add these results together to get the total number of blue birds:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final answer is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of cows added:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- There are 7 days in a week, so in three weeks, there are \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
- Therefore, the total number of cows added is \(20 \times 21 = 420\).

Now, let's calculate the number of chickens added:
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- In three weeks, there are 21 days.
- Therefore, the total number of chickens added is \(10 \times 21 = 210\).

Next, we add the initial number of animals to the number of animals added:
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20
- Total number of cows after three weeks: \(50 + 420 = 470\)
- Total number of chickens after three weeks: \(20 + 210 = 230\)

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
- Total number of animals: \(470 + 230 = 700\)

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs will cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell will get in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write the proportion as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiply to get \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - This simplifies to \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 27\).

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of passengers:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]

Where \( x \) is the common multiplier for the ratio. Simplifying the equation:

\[ 14x = 84 \]

Dividing both sides by 14:

\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men: \( 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the individual sunflowers.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the bouquets.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day.
4. Multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by 3 to get the total for 3 days.

Let's start with the individual sunflowers:

- Faraday earns $2 per sunflower.
- He earns $26 per day from individual sunflowers.
- Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

Next, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets:

- Faraday earns $8 per bouquet.
- He earns $56 per day from bouquets.
- Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.
- Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

Now, let's find the total number of sunflowers sold per day:

- Total sunflowers sold per day = 13 (from individual sunflowers) + 84 (from bouquets) = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:

- Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = 97 * 3 = 291 sunflowers.

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

1. For large-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. For medium-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. For small-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum up the days required for each size of picture scene:
- Total days = 9 (large) + 6 (medium) + 7 (small) = 22 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Final numerical answer: 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning with the second ticket. 

Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60 or 60%.

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of each ticket winning. So, we multiply the probability of the first ticket winning (0.20) by the probability of the second ticket winning (0.60):

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing 0.12 as a percentage, we get 12%.

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which means he sells each device for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price
Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so he bought a total of:
2 + 4 = 6 devices

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
Total profit = Profit per device * Number of devices
Total profit = $20 * 6 = $120

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
50%"

The IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total amount from selling the remaining land is 30 * $3 = $90.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find Geb's age, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let Geb's age be \( G \) and Haley's age be \( H \).

According to the problem, Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. So, we can write:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Given that Haley is 26 years old (\( H = 26 \)), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10 \]

Now, we can calculate the value:

\[ G = 13 - 10 \]
\[ G = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\(36 - 27 = 9\) eggs.

"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old doesn't produce any fruits.
- A 10-year-old produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 2450."

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second relationship:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we can substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third relationship:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

2. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
   \[ 15 - x \]

4. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. So we can set up the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

5. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

7. Now, we know that both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so the yellow paint uses 6 pints (12 pints / 2 = 6 pints).
3. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple.

Since the remaining paint is 12 pints - 6 pints (yellow) = 6 pints, and this is equally divided among red, white, and purple, each of these colors uses 2 pints (6 pints / 3 = 2 pints).

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is 2 pints."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he uses to pay for the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}

   - 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).
   - After each day, the remaining chalk is 80% of the previous day's remaining chalk.
   - So, \( C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \).

3. **Find the number of days \( n \) when the chalk is smaller than 2 inches:**
   - We need to solve \( 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \).
   - Dividing both sides by 2.75, we get \( (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \).
   - Simplifying the right side, \( \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{8}{11} \approx 0.7273 \).
   - So, \( (0.8)^n < 0.7273 \).

4. **Solve for \( n \) using logarithms:**
   - Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get \( \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln(0.7273) \).
   - Using the property of logarithms, \( n \ln(0.8) < \ln(0.7273) \).
   - Since \( \ln(0.8) \) is negative, we divide both sides by \( \ln(0.8) \) and reverse the inequality: \( n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.8)} \).
   - Calculating the values, \( \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.317 \) and \( \ln(0.8) \approx -0.223 \).
   - So, \( n > \frac{-0.317}{-0.223} \approx 1.42 \).

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine how many girls and boys are on varsity.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys.

Now, we can calculate the number of students not on varsity:

- Girls not on varsity: \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) girls.
- Boys not on varsity: \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) boys.

Adding these together gives us the total number of students not on varsity:

- Total students not on varsity: \( 8 + 9 = 17 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

Final numerical answer:
50%"
"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
2. Calculate the refund based on the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of it had passed the expiry date.
\[ \text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Calculate the refund.
The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the refund amount is:
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, Bob can buy \(\boxed{1800}\) books per school."
"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton has 1 apple in his hand.
2. Newton picked up the two apples, putting one in his pocket and throwing the other one into the tree, which caused 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 (in his pocket) + 5 (picked up) = 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 (in his pocket) + 6 (picked up) = 7 apples.
4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie. Since he threw one apple at the tree, he now has 7 apples.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 7."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by her friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since a cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

And since a pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs built per hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs melting per 15 minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net gain of snowballs per hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target number of snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time to reach 60 snowballs**: To find out how many hours it will take to get 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour: \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages left, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have used some bandages from the initial stock to balance the difference.
   - Therefore, the initial stock must have been \(109 - 31 = 78\) bandages (since 109 - 78 = 31).

So, the nurses started with \(\boxed{78}\) bandages on the first day."

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

Step 1: Number of days Jen works in April
Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10:

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \frac{792}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed from the air, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum them up.

1. **Low setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting = 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.

2. **Medium setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting = 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.

3. **High setting:**
   - Removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting = 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we sum up the water removed at each setting:
- Total water removed = 3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters.

The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we first need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with and then subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
   - Each pack has 30 balloons.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.
   - Total balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left
   - Total balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of medicine in one dose.

For one dose:
- Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She combines 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in one dose is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's school is given as 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe his sister is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Jordan's 2 children require a total of 5 diapers each per day, so that's 2 children * 5 diapers/child = 10 diapers per day.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 diapers / 2 = 5 diapers.

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the effective volume is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
3. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
5. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
6. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
7. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of remaining spaces on the bus is:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   The cost of one visit increased by 150%. To find the new cost, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = \text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Initial Cost} \times 150\%) = 2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   So, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.

3. **Number of Visits:**
   Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Over 8 years (5 years + 3 more years), the total number of visits is:
   \[
   \text{Total Visits} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

4. **Cost of Visits Before and After the Increase:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for First 5 Years} = 3 \times 5 \times 2 = 30
     \]
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5. So, the total cost for the next 3 years is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Next 3 Years} = 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 45
     \]

5. **Total Cost:**
   Adding the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years, we get:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30 + 45 = 75
   \]

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and then figure out how many sessions are required given that 8 students can participate in each session.

1. There are 4 grades (4, 5, 6, and 7) and each grade has 10 students.
2. Therefore, the total number of students is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Since 8 students can participate in each session, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per session:

\[
\frac{40}{8} = 5
\]

So, it will take 5 sessions for all 40 students to try the escape room. Since each session takes 45 minutes, the total time required is:

\[
5 \times 45 = 225 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately and then add them together.

For the wooden tables:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total width of the windows.
2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric Luke needs.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the windows.
- There are 5 windows.
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- So, the total width of the windows is \(5 \times 35 = 175\) inches.

Step 2: Multiply the total width by 2.
- Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.
- So, the amount of fabric he needs is \(175 \times 2 = 350\) inches.

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.25/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

For the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes), the cost is $0.20 per minute:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.20/\text{minute} = \$4.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers (10 nails for the manicure and 10 nails for the pedicure).
3. Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure:
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure:
Total discounted price for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers:
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- There are 10 nails for the manicure and 10 nails for the pedicure, so a total of 20 nails.

Cost of nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Finally, let's add the total discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art:
Total cost: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

So, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues per magazine. So, we need to consider the number of magazines as given in the problem statement:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

Final numerical answer:
\(\boxed{5}\)"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's number of paintings:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]
So, the new price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the discounted price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]
So, the price in January after the discount is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.

4 lessons * $80/lesson = $320

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with the veteran. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate.

75% of $80 = 0.75 * $80 = $60

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 2 1-hour lessons with the veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.

2 lessons * $60/lesson = $120

Finally, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to get the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day.

$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's calculate how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after eating:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36:

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples he had left after giving some to his sister:

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."

"To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) Michael has covered. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Distance covered}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60 minutes

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day
Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of these hats are red, so:

Red hats = 100 / 2 = 50 hats

This leaves 50 hats that are not red. Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue:

Blue hats = (3/5) * 50 = 30 hats

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total:

White hats = Total hats - Red hats - Blue hats
White hats = 100 - 50 - 30
White hats = 20

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. With a $3.00 discount, the bag now costs $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the cost per stick in cents, we first calculate the cost per stick in dollars and then convert it to cents.

Cost per stick in dollars = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:

Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100 cents = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions she has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. Each game she scores 21 points. 

To calculate the total number of points she has scored, we can multiply the number of games per year by the number of years and then multiply that by the points scored per game.

Total points = (Number of games per year) × (Number of years) × (Points per game)
Total points = 40 × 4 × 21

Now, let's calculate the total:

Total points = 40 × 4 × 21
Total points = 160 × 21
Total points = 3360

So, Ara has scored a total of 3360 points in the four years."

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights.
2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and there are 2 flashlights for each room, so there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
3. In total, there are \(4 + 16 = 20\) flashlights.

For the candles:
1. There are 4 small candles each for half the rooms. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms. So, there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
2. There are 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms. Again, half of the rooms is 4, so there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
3. In total, there are \(16 + 20 = 36\) candles.

Adding the flashlights and candles together:
- Flashlights: 20
- Candles: 36

The total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each of these takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

So, the Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones in one day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in one day.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Convert the hours spent at work into minutes.
Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day.
It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. So, the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week.

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with the new varnish - Total drying time with the old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts and then sum up the total.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
   \(4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\) cups

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
   \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we need to find out how many plants are left:
   Total plants = 20
   Plants needing half a cup = 4
   Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   Plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8
   So, for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups

\(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \). We know that \( 2x = 20 \), so we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones to get the total cost of the whole phone plan:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

The whole phone plan costs $60."

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days in this period, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds.

So, the total weight is:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular backyard fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the daily feed consumption for one pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, the daily feed consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption for all pigs is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the weekly feed consumption for all five pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption for all pigs is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining feed after a week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the remaining feed is:

4. Determine how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Packs needed = Additional hot dogs needed / Hot dogs per pack
   - Packs needed = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.

5. Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs:
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - Total cost = Packs needed * Cost per pack
   - Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."
"To find out how much money Frances has left, we need to calculate her total earnings and subtract her total expenses.

First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies:
- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, her total earnings are \(40 + 40 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her expenses:
- She buys five trays at $4 each, so her total expenses are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

Given that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find Aaron's speed in minutes per mile by dividing the total time by the distance:

\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is twice that of Aaron's:

\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time she took to complete her part of the race is:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:

"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues step by step.

1. **Number of Reservations per Night**: 6
2. **Number of Meals per Reservation**: 2
3. **Cost per Meal**: $5
4. **Cost of Wine per Reservation**: $5
5. **Number of Nights per Week**: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)
- Cost of wine per reservation: \$5
- Total cost per reservation: \(\$10 + \$5 = \$15\)

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations on one night:
- Total cost per night: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

Now, calculate the total cost for the restaurant being open 2 days a week:
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the restaurant makes a total of \(\$180\) a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

Now, we know that John had James when he was 19. So, James is 18 years old, which means John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Cost of labor
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, so 4 people in total):
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
