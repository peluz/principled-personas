"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we calculate 150% of the purchase price and add it to the purchase price.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. 

To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can multiply the number of sprints per session by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he does this per week:

3 sprints/session * 60 meters/sprint * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which is:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep} \]

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has:

\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep} \]

Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have:

\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \text{ sheep} \]

260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the size of the file and the download rate:**
   - Total file size: 200 GB
   - Download rate: 2 GB/minute

2. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB
   - Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - Time for the restart = 20 minutes

4. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = 0.60 * 200 GB = 120 GB
   - Time to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

5. **Add up all the times:**
   - Time to download 40% of the file = 40 minutes
   - Time for the Windows update restart = 20 minutes
   - Time to download the remaining 60% of the file = 60 minutes
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file, including the restart, is 120 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
   - Distance covered in 0.5 hours = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time of 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
   - Distance covered in 1.5 hours = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He has covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance remaining = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Now, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:

\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:

20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left:

20 students - 4 students = 16 students

Next, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance, which is 25% of the remaining 16 students:

25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

16 students - 4 students = 12 students

Finally, to find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

(12 students / 20 students) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final profit: $96**"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days.

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Final answer:
\[ 7 \text{ dozens} \]"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the remaining distance she needs to cover.
3. Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, let's find the total time Marissa has to complete the hike to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour. The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Using the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

We can rearrange this to find the total time:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles) walking. Therefore, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:

\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance she needs to cover is:

\[ \text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

6 miles per hour"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter of water.
   - Water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter.

4. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters - \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:
15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
3. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can find the number of boxes by dividing the total amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 / $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{\$16.00}\) on ice cream."
"Henry's first stop was after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. 

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance from his first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the 15 miles before the end.

The distance from the first stop to the end of the trip is:
60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles

Since his second stop was 15 miles before the end, he traveled:
40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours a day walking and taking care of each of his 10 dogs. 

So, the total time spent per day on all dogs is:
10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

70"

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, which means the total amount he spent on video games is:

$195 (total earnings) - $5 (leftover) = $190

Since he actually spent $160 on video games, the discrepancy is due to the leftover money. This means he didn't use all the money from selling the lego sets to buy the video games. 

To find out how many lego sets he still has, we need to determine how many sets he sold to get the exact amount he spent on video games. Since he spent $160 and each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets he sold is:

$160 / $15 = 10.6667

Since he can't sell a fraction of a lego set, he must have sold 10 lego sets to get $150, and then he had $45 left (since 10 * $15 = $150). With the $5 leftover after buying the video games, he had a total of $50 left after selling the lego sets. 

So, the number of lego sets he still has is:

13 (original number of lego sets) - 10 (lego sets sold) = 3

Final numerical answer:
3"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. So, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. If her skipping speed is half her running speed, then her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time distribution:
- One-third of the time is spent running.
- Two-thirds of the time is spent walking.

In six hours, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance traveled in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces initially was:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the difference between the initial number of pieces and the remaining pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.
2. Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.
3. Multiply the total number of articles by the average time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.**

\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles.**

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours spent is:
\[
26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

The equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Number of Post-it notes in the package} = (\text{Initial number of Post-it notes} + \text{Remaining Post-it notes}) - \text{Post-it notes used at work} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens produced per day as follows:

252 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 21 dozen eggs per day

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, his daily earnings from selling eggs are:

21 dozen eggs per day * $2 per dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week:

$42 per day * 7 days per week = $294 per week

Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to travel back.

If we assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles, then:

1. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.
2. The speed on the way back is 6 mph.

The distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight to be removed by toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so to find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 40 kittens.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.

28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie outing and then see how many such outings he can afford with his $42.

The cost of one movie ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is $7. Therefore, the total cost for one movie outing is:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this outing with his $42. We do this by dividing his total money by the cost of one outing:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the available weight for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the available weight by the weight of each box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to account for the 25% fee, the $3.00 delivery fee, and the $4.00 tip.

1. Calculate the 25% fee on the initial $40.00 bill:

120 + 67 = 187

Therefore, there are 187 raspberries in total."
"To find the number of good oranges, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Total oranges = 25
Bad oranges = 1
Unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
Sour oranges = 2

Now, let's subtract these from the total:

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)
Good oranges = 25 - 8
Good oranges = 17

The final numerical answer is:

"Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch. The total cost for these items is:

$500 + $800 = $1300

She then pays 10% of this total to get it insured. So, the cost for insurance is:

10% of $1300 = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

The final total amount she paid is the sum of the cost of materials, the cost of construction, and the insurance:

$1300 + $130 = $1430

Final numerical answer:
$1430"
"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the base pension of $50,000 per year. After 20 years, she starts receiving an additional 5% of $50,000 per year.

The additional pension she receives after 20 years is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her total annual pension is:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this increased pension for the remaining 10 years of her 40-year service period.

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service is:
\[ \boxed{52,500} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Charge for the first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year. A 10% reduction in the monthly charge means the new charge is 90% of $140:
\[ \text{New monthly charge} = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
\[ \text{Charge for the second half} = 6 \times 126 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the charges for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the mpg, we divide the miles driven by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank:

\[ \text{Distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

In 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, which means 2 teams per school.
2. Each team has 5 players, so each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players.
3. Each school has also sent a coach for each team, which means 2 coaches per school.
4. Therefore, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.
5. Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent is 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people.

Final numerical answer:
48"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 175 diamonds.
2. There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so the number of rubies is \(175 - 35 = 140\).
3. There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, so the number of emeralds is \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:

\[175 + 140 + 280 = 595\]

So, there are 595 gems in the chest."
"There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls, then there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

If 5 students to every teacher, then the number of teachers is 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

36 teachers"
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday and 8 classes on Saturday. There are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes she teaches in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} + 8 \text{ classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students she teaches in a week is:

\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

She charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is:

"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount to be paid.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Total cost of the cell phones before interest:**
   Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. **Total interest for the 3-month period:**
   A 2% interest is charged on the total cost for each month. So, the interest for one month is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest} = 750 \times \frac{2}{100} = 15
   \]
   Since the interest is charged for 3 months, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 15 \times 3 = 45
   \]

3. **Final amount to be paid:**
   Add the total interest to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 750 + 45 = 795
   \]

4. **Monthly payment:**
   Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
   \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{265}\) each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year will have 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining after the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will consume:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume a total of:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:

1. Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.00}

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the two girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

10 liters"

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of rings from each time it went off:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years:

1. After the first year (6th year of service):
   - New salary = Initial salary + 10% of initial salary
   - New salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New salary = $600 + $60
   - New salary = $660

2. After the second year (7th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New salary = $660 + $66
   - New salary = $726

3. After the third year (8th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New salary = $798.60

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad that the adults will eat.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 5 children will eat:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 20 adults will eat:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, then before the diet change, Gerald would have run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his original speed. To find his new time, we can calculate 10% of his original time and add it to his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 + 4 = 44 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

Total students = 200

Number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \)

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys = 200 - 80 = 120

Now, we know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout.

Number of girls in the girl scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \)

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes needed by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 25 \]

Further simplifying:
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]

Subtracting 15 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 10 \).

"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which gives her a total of:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

Yesterday, she received 18 more potted plants, so her total number of potted plants becomes:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ potted plants} \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Subtracting the 40 potted plants she will give away from her total, she will remain with:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ potted plants} \]

Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is:
\[ 60 + 10 = 70 \]

To find the total number of doorbell rings, we add the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

The doorbell made a total of 175 rings."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average each day for the remaining 4 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he has to read.

Total pages to read:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages to read are:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

He has 4 more days to complete his reading, so the average number of pages he needs to read per day is:
24 pages / 4 days = 6 pages/day

Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days."
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On the weekends, he still has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but he has a soda with dinner instead of water. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = 26 glasses of water.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then solve for \(x\):

\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
420 = 3x

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box, then calculate its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she ate:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he ate:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ roll-ups} \]

Now, we add the number of roll-ups they both ate to get the total:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \text{ roll-ups} \]

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, on average, they ate:
\[ 45 \text{ roll-ups} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this 80 feet. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- Sasha also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Sasha is selling the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- Sasha is also selling the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The new price is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[ 40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves: 60.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit, so we subtract 20 from the initial 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 30."
"Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.

In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May, so his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

To find the total expenditure for those two months, we add the expenditures together:

$500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used is 10 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

60 tickets"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\(41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

To find out how much he pays in a year, we first calculate the monthly cost and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

Monthly cost = 4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60

Annual cost = $60 per month * 12 months = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 20 - 5 = 15 video games right before the comparison.

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times Brian's current number of video games and then subtract 5.

3 * 15 = 45

45 - 5 = 40

Bobby has 40 video games.

Final numerical answer:
40"

"To calculate the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the subs.
2. Calculate the cost of the bags of chips.
3. Calculate the cost of the cookies.
4. Add these amounts to get the subtotal.
5. Calculate the delivery fee (20% of the subtotal).
6. Add the tip.
7. Add the delivery fee and the tip to the subtotal to get the total cost.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Cost of the subs: \(2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00\)
2. Cost of the bags of chips: \(2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00\)
3. Cost of the cookies: \(2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00\)

Now, add these amounts to get the subtotal:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, calculate the delivery fee (20% of the subtotal):
\[ 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Add the tip:
\[ \$4.00 + \$5.00 = \$9.00 \]

Finally, add the delivery fee and the tip to the subtotal to get the total cost:
\[ \$20.00 + \$9.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \$29.00 \]"
"Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Given that he had 8 hours to complete the test, he could have theoretically answered:

\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

However, the first test consisted of 75 questions. Since he could only answer 40 questions in the given time, he left:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \, \text{questions} \]

unanswered.

For the second test, Mark also worked at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Given that he had 6 hours to complete the test, he could have theoretically answered:

\[ 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{questions} \]

The second test consisted of 100 questions. Since he could only answer 30 questions in the given time, he left:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \, \text{questions} \]

unanswered.

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, we have:
\[ B = 12 \]
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Using the first relationship, we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Using the second relationship, we can express W in terms of B: W = 2B. Since B = 2Q, we can substitute to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now we can substitute W and B in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know the number of queens (Q), we can find the number of baby bees (B) and worker bees (W):
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. If he spent that time working instead, he would work 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

Since he earns $10 an hour, in one week he would earn 14 hours * $10/hour = $140.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

Tax = 10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:

10 dollars (non-food items) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:

- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

Total cost = 5 dollars (food items) + 11 dollars (non-food items including tax) = 16 dollars

The final numerical answer is:

16 dollars"
"Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients.

Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

The cost for bleach for one client is:
2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4

The cost for cloths for one client is:
1 pack * $5/pack = $5

So, the total cost for supplies for one client is:
$4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

For 8 clients, the total cost for supplies is:
8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
$92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, with 100 pineapples per hectare. He can harvest every 3 months, which means there are 4 harvests in a year.

First, calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per year:
100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year

Now, calculate the total number of pineapples for 10 hectares:
400 pineapples/hectare/year * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples/year

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave the hive, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive.

From the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours. So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the first 12 hours.

In the last 6 hours, these 15 bees return to the hive.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15.

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

\[
\boxed{48}

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Distance for one back and forth run = 100 yards (to the end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards.
- Total distance Blake runs = 15 runs * 200 yards/run = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Distance for one back and forth run to the 40-yard line and back = 40 yards (to the 40-yard line) + 40 yards (back) = 80 yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs = 34 runs * 80 yards/run = 2720 yards.

Now, we find the difference in the distances they run:
- Distance Blake runs = 3000 yards.
- Distance Kelly runs = 2720 yards.
- Difference = 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, the price will increase 18 times.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20. Therefore, after each increase, the new price is 1.20 times the previous price.

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs:

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together:
Sally Two (19 years) + Granny Red (16 years) + Sally Four (8 years) + Sally Thirtytwo (8 years) = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years.

The total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts each month, we first need to determine the total minimum monthly payment and then calculate 50% more than that amount.

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loans: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   - Total minimum monthly payment: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the total minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 is $1000 * 0.50 = $500
   - Total payment per month: $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total payment for a year:

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is equal to \( 300 \) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, \( 300 \) seconds is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for peeling and cutting:
- Time to peel: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Time to cut: \( 5 \) minutes.
- Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, let's calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- Therefore, the total amount of straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Now, we know that the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces. So, the straw used for the rabbits is:

- \(160 - 50 = 110\) pieces of straw for the rabbits.

Since the problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits, we can confirm that the remaining 110 pieces of straw are for the rats.

Now, let's find out how many rats there are in total:

- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- Therefore, the total number of rats is \(110 \div 6 = 18.333...\).

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and we know the rats are distributed equally among 3 cages, we can conclude that the total number of rats is 18 (as 18 is the closest whole number that can be evenly divided by 6 and fits the context of the problem).

Finally, to find out how many rats are in each cage:

- There are 3 cages, and 18 rats in total.
- Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(18 \div 3 = 6\).

So, the number of rats in each cage is 6.

160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.
6 rats are in each cage."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of tickets:**

   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese per omelet.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets: \(3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ omelets} = 9 \text{ slices}\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese: \(8 \text{ slices}\).

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:

- Slices for sandwiches: 14
- Slices for omelets: 9
- Slices for macaroni and cheese: 8

Total slices of cheese used: \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\).

**Final Answer:**

"Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which totals to:

22 + 10 = 32 pens

She then bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag, which adds:

6 * 9 = 54 blue pens

Additionally, she bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag, which adds:

2 * 6 = 12 red pens

Now, to find the total number of pens Janet has, we add all the pens together:

32 (initial pens) + 54 (blue pens) + 12 (red pens) = 98 pens

Final numerical answer:
98"
"To get an average of 93 over six tests, Brinley needs to have a total of \(93 \times 6 = 558\) points across her six tests, because the average is the total sum of scores divided by the number of tests.

Brinley's current total from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

To find out what she needs on the sixth test, we subtract her current total from the required total:

\(558 - 438 = 120\).

However, since Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average, Brinley should aim to remove the lowest score from her first five tests before adding the sixth test score. The lowest score among her first five tests is 71.

So, if Brinley removes 71 from her total, her new total becomes \(438 - 71 = 367\).

To get an average of 93, she needs a total of 558 points. Therefore, the score she needs on the sixth test is:

\(558 - 367 = 191\).

Brinley needs to score 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93, after removing her lowest score of 71."
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time for 4 weeks. So, the total distance for the first period is:

\[ 5 \text{ times/week} \times 25 \text{ km/time} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Then, he changed his routine and rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, the total distance for the second period is:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 60 \text{ km/time} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Adding the distances from both periods gives the total distance:

\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Micheal did a total of 860 kilometers."
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups would be \(240\) cups (since one dozen is 12).
   - Let the cost of one cup be \(x\).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(240x\).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, we can write the equation as:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times Sara mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have is $10 + $20 (from babysitting) + 4x (from mowing the lawn).

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the following equation:
\[ 10 + 20 + 4x = 70 \]
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

44"
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He uses these 25 pens, which means he now has 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he now has 5 empty pens from the new pens plus the 20 empty pens left from the original 25 pens (since 25 - 5 = 20). So, he has a total of 25 empty pens again.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   - 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."

"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day, he uses 15 minutes for a call with his boss. Over 30 days, he uses:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people.

So, the total minutes used this month is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of **$27,000**."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts.

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(30\) girls in total.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has \(20 - 15 = 5\) boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has \(20 - 12 = 8\) boys.
6. The total number of boys in the first and second classes is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
7. Since there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of cows in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall had 20 cows, and now each stall has 2 more cows, so each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8:

\[ 22 \times 8 = 176 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before termites ate any of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

From point 3, we know:
\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

From point 2, we know:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

$100 (Carmen) + $125 (Samantha) + $175 (Daisy) = $400.

The final numerical answer is:
$400"
"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time it took to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** 
   - Time to heat to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
   - Time to heat to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
   - Time to cook: 23 minutes
   - Total time: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.
- Therefore, the total cost for television ads is \( 75 \times 15 = 1125 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost for newspaper ads + Cost for television ads
- Total cost = \( 250 + 1125 = 1375 \) dollars.

The real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Finally, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

Final numerical answer:
30"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long.
- To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead: \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

There are two rows of 6 stars, so:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each 5-star row contributes 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, and his total remains 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household.
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Assuming each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the household consumes rice twice a day.
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (since 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds).

The final numerical answer is:
8 pounds"

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

- An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
- An extra leg is grown every 5 days.

First, we calculate the number of extra arms grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]
So, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

Next, we calculate the number of extra legs grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]
So, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
6 suits * $100/suit = $600

Next, the cost of the suitcases:
3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:
5 * $100 + $700 = $500 + $700 = $1200

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000.

Now, let's add up all the expenses and the amount he wants to save to find out how much he has in total:
$600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) + $2000 (savings) = $3950

The total amount Theo has is $6000, so the amount he has left to spend on gifts is:
$6000 - $3950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

1. In the family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
2. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Since Noah was 20 years old, the population of Chile six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Total invited: \(12 + 12 = 24\) people

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness

Now, we calculate the number of people who had previous commitments:

- \(1/4\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness: \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

- 8 (due to illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people show up:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\) people

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

"Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Solomon has now is:

50 (original marbles) + 20 (bought from Johanna) = 70 marbles

His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, the number of marbles given by his father is:

2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles

Adding the marbles given by his father to the total, we get:

70 (Solomon's marbles) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

78 marbles * 2kgs/marble = 156kgs

Total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store: 156kgs"
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of electric poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of electric poles}}{\text{Number of electric wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles. Then we have:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find \( P \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is:

15

The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must have been women (10 - 3 = 7).

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7, and since there were originally 15 women, the number of women who stayed is 8 (15 - 7 = 8).

The pen costs $1."
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. We don't need to know the exact number of pencils in each box to solve this problem, as we are only concerned with the total number of pencils.

Meg has 46 pencils.

Now, we add the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

To store all 72 pencils, we need to consider that Jam already has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. This means that the 3 boxes are already being used, and we need to find out how many more boxes are needed for the remaining pencils.

Since we don't know the exact number of pencils in each of Jam's boxes, we can assume that the 3 boxes are already full and we need to find out how many more boxes are needed for the remaining pencils.

The total number of pencils is 72, and we already have 2 loose pencils, so we need to store 70 pencils in boxes. If we assume that each box can hold the same number of pencils as the 26 pencils minus the 2 loose pencils (which is 24 pencils per box), then we can calculate the number of additional boxes needed:

70 pencils / 24 pencils per box = 2.9167 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which means we need 3 more boxes.

So, in total, Jam and Meg need:

3 (Jam's boxes) + 3 (additional boxes) = 6 boxes

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes added and then use that to find the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream.

First, we calculate the number of ice cubes added. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees, so the number of ice cubes added is:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the weakening effect from the ice cubes is:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Shannon also adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect is:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly pay is:

\[ \text{Monthly pay for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

We are given that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, to find out how long it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly rate: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can write these as equations:
\[ C + H = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:
160"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 - 2 = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 2 balls.

2 balls"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.

Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which means he should run:

\[ 5000 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 5000\right) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

June has 30 days, so if Tyson trains for a month in June, the total distance he would cover is:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies/week

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in a bag:
36 cookies (total) - 27 cookies (consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = $30 × 2 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 × $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."

"To calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs for food, treats, and medicine, and then multiply by the number of months in a year.

1. **Food Cost per Year:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for food is $25 * 4 = $100.
   - Over a year, the cost for food is $100 * 12 = $1200.

2. **Treats Cost per Year:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Over a year, the cost for treats is $20 * 12 = $240.

3. **Medicine Cost per Year:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Over a year, the cost for medicine is $100 * 12 = $1200.

4. **Total Cost per Year:**
   - Adding up all the costs: $1200 (food) + $240 (treats) + $1200 (medicine) = $2640.

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in savings from the cost of the phone.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate total savings after adding earnings to initial savings:
   - Total savings = $80 (initial savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate the amount still needed to save:
   - Amount needed = $400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total savings) = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we first find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the height of the tallest tree:
\[ 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (including herself) is:
$5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, we subtract this from her budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
$90 (budget) - $30 (Morgan's expenses) = $60

Each friend will need the same amount as Morgan for mini-golf, go-karts, and arcade tokens, which is $30. So, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
$60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. We know he spent half of his change on gumballs, and he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.

2. Calculate the cost of 40 gumballs:
   \[
   40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2
   \]

3. Since the $2 was half of his change, his total change after buying the candy was:
   \[
   2 \times \$2 = \$4
   \]

4. Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$4 = \$6
   \]

5. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation:

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days."

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[ 3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50 \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[ 31 + x = 50 \]

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the interest on the loan and the total amount to be repaid over the five months. 

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so the total distance Cho hiked is:
\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so the total distance Chloe hiked is:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since each cup is sold for $1:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Millie's total cost for supplies is $18. Therefore, her profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since it takes her 9 hours to sell all the lemonade, her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Final answer:
\[ \$2 \text{ per hour} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services he is getting.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost per month for both is reduced.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The original cost for both is $10 + $10 = $20.
- A 20% discount on $20 is 0.20 * $20 = $4.
- So, the discounted cost for both is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Total cost for streaming services = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find out how much Tim saves:
- Savings = $60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package."
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is 2 hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours (since 90 minutes = 1.5 hours)

Now, let's add up the total time spent:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100

"Mel originally uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts per hour. If he reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will only use it for 3 hours a day.

First, let's calculate the energy used per day before and after the reduction:

- Original daily energy usage: \( 8 \, \text{hours} \times 900 \, \text{watts} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \)
- Reduced daily energy usage: \( 3 \, \text{hours} \times 900 \, \text{watts} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \)

Now, let's find the daily savings in energy usage:

- Daily savings: \( 7200 \, \text{watts} - 2700 \, \text{watts} = 4500 \, \text{watts} \)

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily savings to kilowatts:

- Daily savings in kilowatts: \( \frac{4500 \, \text{watts}}{1000} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \)

Finally, to find the total savings over 30 days:

- Total savings in 30 days: \( 4.5 \, \text{kW/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kW} \)

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days."

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

First, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are considered ""more dangerous"" and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since 5% of these candles have this defect, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

The problem does not provide information about the percentage of candles that explode, so we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, based on the information given, we can only conclude that 2,500 candles have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \( x \).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\).

So, the total amount from the banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\).

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get:

\[5000 + 12000 = 17000\]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats carried away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\$256

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{tattered} \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price is $28, and the savings is $4, so:

\[ P_{tattered} - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_{tattered} = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{jogger} \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price is $22, and the savings is $2, so:

\[ P_{jogger} - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_{jogger} = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ P_{jogger} - P_{tattered} = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute value of the difference is:

\[ |24 - 32| = 8 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each: \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each: \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up all the capacities:

\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket for $100 and having $50 in spending cash, the remaining money is \( x - 100 = 50 \).

From the equation \( x - 100 = 50 \), we can solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 + 100 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
150"
"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog each.

So, the total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
\[ 18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and they all wanted a second one. So, they would need an additional 40 hot dogs.

The total number of hot dogs required for 40 guests, each having two hot dogs, would be:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since only 54 hot dogs were prepared, the number of hot dogs short is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Therefore, 26 guests did not get a second hot dog.

26 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the remaining amount:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can determine how much money George spent on candy bars:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} - 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \text{ candy bars} \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the cost per serving, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Calculate the total cost of the soup.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he will use:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
   \]

3. The beef stock is on sale for $2.00 a box, and he needs 2 boxes, so the total cost of the beef stock is:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
   \]

4. The total cost of the soup is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
   \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[
   \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving}

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final answer: 59 minutes"
"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance covered is \(32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
   - Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats \(16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8\) bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for 8 bails of hay is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills.
   - Therefore, he has \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the change after buying the hay:**
   - Michael spends $24 on hay.
   - Therefore, the change he has is \(30 - 24 = 6\) dollars.

   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost is the cost of the entire case, which is $576. So, the profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[
\boxed{539}

"To find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each type of packet and then add them together.

For the six packets with eight pieces each:
6 packets * 8 pieces/packet = 48 pieces

For the four packets with sixteen pieces each:
4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, we add the two quantities together:
48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21
2. Regular ticket: $12 + cost of popcorn + $3 for soda
3. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the super ticket.

The cost of the super ticket is $21. Since you saved $2, the cost of the regular ticket and the popcorn and soda together is $21 + $2 = $23.

The regular ticket is $12 and the soda costs $3, so the cost of the popcorn is:

$23 (total cost) - $12 (ticket) - $3 (soda) = $8

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost of filling 20 balloons on the first day was $900. Therefore, the cost of filling one balloon is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. For the first part of the trip:
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. For the second part of the trip:
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

3. Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

4. Total time taken = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

5. Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   15 \times 0.60 = 9
   \]
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 green cards.
3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   So, there are 39 yellow cards.
4. To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't make a fraction of a trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles each week. 

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

The order cost is $15.

The tip amount is 1/5 of $15:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the order cost to get the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Order Cost} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."

3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Adding the basketball and baseball cards together, she has:

\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards} \]

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. 

The total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * $0.45/apple = $9.00

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
$9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

The total cost before the discount is:
20 apples * $0.50/apple = $10.00

A 10 percent discount on $10.00 is:
10% of $10.00 = 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:
$10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total:
$9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

-30 / 3 = -10°F

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

$12 - $4 = $8

If he saves $2 daily, the number of days it will take him to save the remaining $8 is:

$8 ÷ $2/day = 4 days

It will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs.

First, calculate the total capacity of the 2 trays:
2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, subtract the total capacity of the trays from the number of eggs Jaime has:
64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

Sally spends $32 in all."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Heather is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after discounts / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

So, in four years, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old.

If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides over 14 days, the cost is:
14 days * $6/day = $84

For the afternoon rides over 14 days, the cost is:
14 days * $2/day = $28

The total cost for both morning and afternoon rides over 14 days is:
$84 + $28 = $112

Therefore, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes the food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions involving \(D\):
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. 

First, we need to find out how much yarn they used together in terms of a fraction of a skein:

\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can find out how many yards they used by calculating \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 364:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

Therefore, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"Cherrie is buying gifts for 5 friends. 

2 friends want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts.
3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.

"The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the width of the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug)

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.
5. She paid $7 in all.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$144.00 \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week, so she takes a total of:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the farm's count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

Total number of animals = 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

Total items Sophia bought: 4"
"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

Step 1: Total calories to burn
Andy wants to lose 30 lbs, and it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total calories to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

Step 2: Number of days
Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to the 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Daily calorie deficit
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of it on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving half to his sister, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \). The total cost equation is:

\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):

\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have $48. We need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $48. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $48 by $4:

\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, we know that for 6 out of the 8 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we account for the 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, there was 1 week where he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all these hours to get the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so the cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Currently, Jame's cousin will be 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.
- Therefore, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:
- Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
- $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Simplifying the equation:
- $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
- 2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2:
- Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."

"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the total bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill:

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total Bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill, you will pay your share of the total bill, which is half of $60:

\[ \text{Your Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   So, he now has $11.

3. The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   So, he now has $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13
   \]
   So, he now has $13.

5. He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, the daily savings in the second half is \( 2x \).

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half of the month:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half of the month:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To calculate the total cost of the items Daniel wants to buy, we first need to find the cost of each item without the discount, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount.

1. Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
2. Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
3. Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Now, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00 \]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

3. Cost of 4 broken vases: $12 each, so 4 * $12 = $48

Now, we add these amounts together:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

The final numerical answer is:
$308"
"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per month.
4. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
5. Find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: Now, we find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Final numerical answer:
100"
"To calculate how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we need to determine how many months are in 2 years and then calculate the total amount removed from the account.

1 year = 12 months
2 years = 2 * 12 = 24 months

Katina removes $100 from the account every month. So, over 24 months, she will remove:

$100 * 24 = $2400

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount in the account:

$3000 - $2400 = $600

After 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Net profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Total cost per sandwich
   - Net profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Net Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - If they sell 10 sandwiches, the net profit is 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
3. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). In this case, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the starting value.
\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Step 2: Add this value to the starting value and then divide by 5.
\[ \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12.
\[ 6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the value of Juan's house as follows:

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts (assuming a pair is two contacts) is:
\[ 1.00 \times 2 = 2.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for each person. Since they are paid $10 per hour:

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"Jared's initial typing speed is 47 WPM. After some lessons, it increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed by 5 WPM once more, his new typing speed will be:

52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we have three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and divide by 3:

(47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52 WPM

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain twice as much protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so in a week (7 days), he would consume:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

- Each implant costs $2000, and George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is:
  \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

- For one of the implants, he wants a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
  \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

- George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
  \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

- George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
  \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, but we only need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 8 quarters = 8 * 5 = 40 nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 dime = 2 nickels, 6 dimes = 6 * 2 = 12 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in the form we need.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 nickel = 5 pennies, 15 pennies = 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
40 (from quarters) + 12 (from dimes) + 14 (from nickels) + 3 (from pennies) = 69 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in an hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total amount they can make in one hour by 12:

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total earnings from the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total earnings from the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to get the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 400 miles a month and the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Now, for 400 miles:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year:
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in **6 years**."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 20 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, we need to find the cost per single pump, so we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{2} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the discount on the shirt:**
   - The original price of the shirt is $25.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).
   - The sale price of the shirt is \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts:**
   - The sale price of the shirt is $17.50.
   - The price of the shorts is $35.
   - The total cost before tax is \( 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \).

3. **Determine if there is enough money to cover the purchase:**
   - Joe has $50.
   - The total cost is $52.50.
   - Since $52.50 is more than $50, Joe does not have enough money to make the purchase.

4. **Calculate the shortfall:**
   - The shortfall is \( 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \).

Since the problem states that sales tax is included, and Joe does not have enough money to cover the purchase, the final numerical answer is:

Joe will be short by $2.50."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so the total duration of the research is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

93000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:
   \[
   \text{Total seats} = 4 \text{ rows} \times 18 \text{ seats per row} = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. Determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. Determine the number of seats occupied by the parents:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

5. Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students:
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}
   \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Final numerical answer:
76"

2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces of gum are left before he gives any to his sister:

- Remaining gum: \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- Gum given to sister: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces

Finally, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day:

- Remaining gum after giving to sister: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces

So, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day."

"Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. 

First, we calculate the total number of flowers planted:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Currently, only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. So, we calculate the number of bloomed flowers:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

1. First, convert kb/s to Mb/s:
   \[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

2. Then, convert Mb/s to Mb/h:
   \[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for the first three days, so that's 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

For the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars each day than the first three days, which means it pulled 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars each of those days.

So for the remaining four days, it towed 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.

Adding the cars towed over the entire week, we get 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.

Total number of cars towed that week: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}

"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders can stay upright} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women can stay upright} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to first calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, so the cost per class is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10, and remember to reverse the inequality sign:

\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, \( x \leq 4 \). This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these amounts together:

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we add the bonus to the new monthly salary to get the total monthly earnings:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply the total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental cost: $5000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"If it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork.

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.

Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook beans.

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 (rice) + 50 (pork) + 40 (beans) = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand:
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = $1 \).

So, the more expensive brand costs \( $5 + $1 = $6 \) per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times $6 = $42 \).

He also buys himself a donut for $2.

The total cost for everything is \( $42 + $2 = $44 \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$44"
"Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

Let's calculate the total cost of the items we know:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars
- 1 bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda: $1.00

Adding these up: \(4 + 8 + 1 = 13\) dollars

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can find the cost of the apple pie by subtracting the total cost of the known items from the total amount spent:

\(20 - 13 = 7\) dollars

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to A + Newspapers to C)

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)

Now, let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and it lasts for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers, so:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 360 \text{ hours} \]"
"Given that Aurelia has $120, we can determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna's money is:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money of Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the first three quarters is:

3 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 36 minutes

In the last quarter, there was a tie, and the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes. So, the last quarter lasted:

12 minutes + 5 minutes = 17 minutes

Adding the time for the first three quarters and the extended last quarter gives us the total game time:

36 minutes + 17 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."

30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they share equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, if they share this candy equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:

12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
$15 - $11 = $4

Therefore, Adam got $4 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. 

Given that her first 8 days were good, her next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral, we can calculate the number of neutral days as follows:

Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = Neutral days
30 - (12 + 8) = 10 neutral days

This means that out of the 8 neutral days in the third segment, there are actually 2 more neutral days in addition to the 8 already accounted for.

Now, if the next three days were good, neutral, and good, we can update the count of good days:

Good days + 2 more good days = 12 + 2 = 14 good days

So, the number of good days left in the month is 14."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:

\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days needed = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Final answer:
12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. This means James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

24"

"To find out by how much the group of people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator from this total.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight of 9 adults = 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:
   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group of 9 adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the time they have already spent is:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is also \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from step 3 into the equation for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's solve for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill}
   - Total Bill - 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill} = $40
   - 0.4 \times \text{Total Bill} = $40
   - \text{Total Bill} = $40 / 0.4
   - \text{Total Bill} = $100.

7. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27."
"Greta puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

She uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

To find out how much money she has left to spend, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and her car payment from her total paycheck:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend."

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with step 1:

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Next, step 2:

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display is:
\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Now, step 3:

Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Finally, step 4:

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks she sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

So, Gerald received 3 parts, which is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia received 2 parts, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised in the first 3 hours. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, the amount raised per hour is:

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Total hours needed to fundraise to reach the goal: 6 hours

Therefore, they need to fundraise for a total of 3 (initial hours) + 6 (additional hours) = 9 hours to reach their goal."
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

"To calculate how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in 2 weeks.
2. Multiply the number of days by the daily rate.

There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are:
\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Alex charges $12 per day, so for 14 days, the total charge is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168 \]

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 1 free (since 4 is more than 3 but less than 6, which would give her 2 free scoops). 

So, if she buys 4 scoops, she will have a total of 5 scoops (4 bought + 1 free).

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream.

4 scoops"
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces, so after two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden would need, we can follow these steps:

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Each ounce of cheese is 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Each ounce of ham is 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories

The final numerical answer is:

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, candidate A received:

\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes. So, candidate B received:

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes."
"Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples.

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have \(100 - 10 = 90\) apples, and Beck will have \(77 + 10 = 87\) apples.

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples: \(90 - 87 = 3\).

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
3. Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Let's start with step 1:

- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5

Total number of students who like to bake or play basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, step 2:

Total number of students in the class = 50

Number of students who like to play video games or play music = 50 - 15 = 35

For step 3, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

"To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children.

Total cost for adults in the first park: \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \)
Total cost for children in the first park: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

Total cost for the first amusement park: \( 52 + 24 = 76 \)

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children.

Total cost for adults in the second park: \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \)
Total cost for children in the second park: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

Total cost for the second amusement park: \( 28 + 20 = 48 \)

Now, we find the difference between the total costs of the two parks to determine the savings:
Savings: \( 76 - 48 = 28 \)

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times $0.10/\text{tomato} = $50/\text{day} \]

Now, to find the weekly savings, we multiply the daily savings by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ $50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = $350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for 1/3 of a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 9 = 49 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = 0.5 * 49 = 24.5 large stickers.
   - Since we can't have half a sticker in this context, we'll assume she trades 24 large stickers for large buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has 49 - 24 = 25 large stickers left and 24 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 25 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 25 large stickers = 25 * 3 = 75 small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has 75 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 9 large buttons from the small stickers trade and 24 large buttons from the large stickers trade, totaling 9 + 24 = 33 large buttons.
   - She also has 75 small buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 33 large buttons + 75 small buttons = 108 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

"To find the final price after a 5% discount on a $140 bag, we first calculate the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price.

1. Calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 7 \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final price:
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 133 \]

So, after the 5% discount, you will pay $133."

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, let's find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we can determine how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = 71.42857142857143 \]

Since the third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, we calculate:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 71.42857142857143 = 142.85714285714286 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the third house will need 143 cases of shingles.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Total wheels needed:
228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Now, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels available in the box:

650 wheels (available) - 374 wheels (needed) = 276 wheels

Final numerical answer:
276 wheels will be left."
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

The total cost is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:
4400"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for a certain number of hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Let's denote the time spent driving as \( t_d \) hours.
   - The distance driven is \( 50 \times t_d \) miles.

2. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
   - The distance hiked is \( 20 \times 1.5 \) miles.

3. **Total time spent traveling:**
   - The total time spent traveling is 6 hours, which is the sum of the time spent driving and hiking.
   - So, \( t_d + 1.5 = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( t_d \), we get \( t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Distance driven: \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.
   - Distance hiked: \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.
   - Total distance: \( 225 + 30 = 255 \) miles.

The total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \), and the time she finishes the level as \( T_e \) seconds. For Ava, we'll use \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_a = T_e + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30(T_e - T_e) = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30(T_e - (T_e + 4)) = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(-4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is -25."
"The total cost for four pizzas is $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total. To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we first subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:

$64 - $30 = $34

This $34 is the total cost for the remaining two pizzas. Since the two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:

$34 / 2 = $17

Each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, and twice the usual time (which is 3 times) on 2 other days.

First, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days:
3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 2 special days:
2 * 3 rides/day * 2 days = 6 rides

Now, add the number of rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 6 rides = 21 rides

So, they ride their bikes 21 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have the equation:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

Let's solve the second equation for \( O \):

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

Now substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the first equation:

\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 5 + 2W \):

\[ O = 5 + 2(4) \]
\[ O = 5 + 8 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the total number of fish and the ratio of orange to white fish:

- Total fish bought: \( O + W = 13 + 4 = 17 \)
- Orange fish after buying: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- White fish after buying: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Ratio: \( 16 : 8 = 2 : 1 \)

The solution is correct. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

Given that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, we can calculate the number of smart TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Given that one-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, we can calculate the number of analog TVs sold as follows:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) \]
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) \]

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100 or 0.8. Therefore, 0.8 * 400 = 320 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 680
- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

"To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we need to first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students and then add the remaining tea to find the initial amount.

1. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the four students:
   - Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts.
   - Total for four students: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

2. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the sixteen students:
   - Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts.
   - Total for sixteen students: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

3. Calculate the total amount of tea consumed by all the students:
   - Total consumed: \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.

4. Add the remaining tea to the total consumed to find the initial amount of tea:
   - Remaining tea: 10 quarts.
   - Initial amount: \(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts.

5. Convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons (1 gallon = 4 quarts):
   - Initial amount in gallons: \(48 \div 4 = 12\) gallons.

Final numerical answer:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after ordering more and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Initial candies: 100
2. Sold candies: 150
3. Ordered more: 100

Total candies after ordering more: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they made 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

Starting with 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

With 14 marshmallows left, and assuming they want to make an equal number of S'mores, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Final numerical answer:
7 S'mores each."

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance used is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar used is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ s + s + z + z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( z = 1 \) back into \( s = 2z \), we get:
\[ s = 2 \]

The amount of oil used is \( 2s \), so:
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Robert has 20 cars. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, the number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

The total number of cars Joe gives away and sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Joe remains with 16 cars."
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time she walked in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the amount he earns in a day.
3. Calculate the amount he earns in a week.

Step 1: Number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the number of tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Step 2: Earnings per day
Each task pays $1.20.
So, the earnings per day = 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day.

Step 3: Earnings per week
John works a full 7-day week.
So, the earnings per week = $180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week.

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Cindy had 5 green eggs.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the original cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The original cost of the book is $32.
   - The net loss is the original cost minus the refund plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Time spent per week on recording videos = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on recording videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Time spent per month on writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Time spent per week on doing makeup = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on doing makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Time spent on recording videos: 288 minutes
- Time spent on writing songs: 8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]

Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then the distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

The time \(T\) it takes for one turtle to cross the distance \(D\) is:

\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle}} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2}} = 54v \times \frac{2}{v} = 108 \text{ hours} \]

Since all four turtles are traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance simultaneously, the time it takes for all four turtles to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes for one turtle.

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

\[ \boxed{108} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gives her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means the total amount she has now is $400 - $50 = $350.
5. To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has from her job and her mom from the total amount she has: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

In total, Adam has:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow. With 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Final numerical answer:

"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 8 (students good at English only) = 12 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (students good at math only) + 12 (students good at both math and English) = 17 students good at math.

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such intervals fit into the total concert time minus the intermission.

Each group takes:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert is 2 hours long, which is:
2 * 60 = 120 minutes

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for the groups to perform is:
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes:
110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11

11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then multiply it by the number of years.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it accumulates at the same rate each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs / 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

If he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total earnings will be:

30 trays * $2.5/tray = $75

The farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, so he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Altogether, the number of goats left in the two farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- Add the cost of the green food and the red food together: \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( C \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( C = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = C - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( C + A + B + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( A \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( A = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
- \( M = 3B - 1 \).

Now, substitute these expressions into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ C + A + B + M = (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, we can find the ages of the other individuals:
- \( C = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).
- \( A = B - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \).
- \( M = 3B - 1 = 3 \cdot 16 - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \).

So, you are 13 years old.

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number.
- Therefore, he needs 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all students and some extra.

Final numerical answer:

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
1 badge/month * 12 months/year = 12 badges/year

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 1/2 badge. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
(1 badge/month / 2) * 12 months/year = 6 badges/year

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
3 * 12 badges/year = 36 badges/year

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges:
36 badges/year (Wendy) - 6 badges/year (Amber) = 30 badges

Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), the number of books Anne has as \( A \), and the number of books Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we have:
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Substituting \( A \) in the second equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now, substituting \( S \) and \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. Iris spent $400 on her hair.
2. She spent 1/4 as much on a manicure, so the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. She spent 3/4 as much as the manicure on a pedicure, so the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[
\boxed{575}

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
- The rope is 20 meters long.
- The price per meter is $2.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah will get is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
- The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
- Since Sarah is buying a rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost of the new rope is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30\).

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope.
- The money Sarah has after selling the rope is $40.
- The cost of the new rope is $30.
- Therefore, the money Sarah will have left over is \( \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \).

"If in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can determine her current age by subtracting 10 from 18. So, Melanie is currently 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

Let's denote the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be three times her current age as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, Melanie's age will be \( 8 + x \).

We want to find \( x \) such that Melanie's age in \( x \) years is three times her current age. So, we set up the equation:

\[ 8 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is $2 * 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 * 6 = $24.

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 * 3 = $12.

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Total cost of bacon: $10
- Total cost of chicken: $24
- Total cost of strawberries: $12
- Total cost of apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

$65 - $60 = $5

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, let's denote the payment per lawn mowing as \( p \).

From the information given, we know that:
\[ 6 = px \]

So, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ px + 3px + 5px = 9px \]

Since \( px = 6 \), we can substitute to get:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

So, Tasha made $54 from mowing lawns.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."

"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel did not read any pages today, so his total remains 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults.

This leaves us with:
- 4 - 2 = 2 adult bowls worth of soup remaining
- 8 child bowls of soup

Since each child bowl is equivalent to half an adult bowl (because 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls, so 1 child bowl = 1/2 adult bowl), we can convert the remaining 2 adult bowls into child bowls:
- 2 adult bowls * 2 (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls) = 4 child bowls

Now, Calvin has 4 child bowls of soup left after the adults have eaten. There are 2 children, so we divide the remaining soup equally between them:
- 4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Adding the material needed for both types of masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

12

So, the final numerical answer is:

12"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget after accounting for the expenses he has already made and the expenses for the current day.

1. **Initial Monthly Budget**: $150
2. **Expenses so far**:
   - Movies: 5 (Fridays or Saturdays) + 8 (other days) = 13 movies
     - Cost per movie on Fridays or Saturdays: $10
     - Cost per movie on other days: $7
     - Total cost for 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: 5 * $10 = $50
     - Total cost for 8 movies on other days: 8 * $7 = $56
     - Total cost for 13 movies: $50 + $56 = $106
   - Popcorn: 2 tubs at $8 each
     - Total cost for popcorn: 2 * $8 = $16
   - Candy: 4 boxes at $2 each
     - Total cost for candy: 4 * $2 = $8
   - Total expenses so far: $106 + $16 + $8 = $130

3. **Remaining Budget**: $150 - $130 = $20

4. **Current Day Expenses**:
   - Movie: It's a Friday, so the ticket costs $10.
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Candy: $2
   - Total for the current day: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

5. **Remaining Budget After Current Day Expenses**: $20 - $20 = $0

Since Colby's remaining budget is $0 after accounting for the current day's expenses, he cannot see any more movies.

**Final Answer: 0**"
"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"The bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Maria invited 4 friends, and each friend received 2 water balloons at the start, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 additional balloons.

Now, let's add all the balloons together:

8 (initial balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) + 15 (additional balloons) = 24 total balloons.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed - Tables they already have = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average of these two totals:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles of apple juice from the coupons is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs:

$90 (total cost) - $200 (money from selling 5 CDs) = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110 from the transaction. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. In this case, he was not out any money; instead, he gained $110.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims initially.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the resting time.
4. Determine the remaining distance and the new swimming speed.
5. Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance.
6. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance and new swimming speed:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times sales.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, for the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Adding the two amounts together gives the total commission:
\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

We can use the second and third equations to express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."

"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

First, we calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:
- From 10 p.m. to 2:15 a.m. is 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 255 minutes.
- From 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 17 minutes, which is 197 minutes.
- Adding these two periods together gives us the total time she was asleep: 255 + 197 = 452 minutes.

Next, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she was asleep:
- 452 minutes (total asleep) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 429 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 429 minutes that day."

   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Two-thirds of the remainder are sent to family, so:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails

One-third of these other emails are sent to her boyfriend, so:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is \( 7J \) and we know that \( 7J = 7 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

7"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes dug

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is 2.

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
31 (holes dug) - 2 (holes filled) = 29 holes

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes dug. So, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes by the end of the third day from the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
40 (holes by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (holes by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got:

\[70 + 70 = 140\]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so Collins got:

\[70 + 15 = 85\]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[140 + 85 = 225\]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

225"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so we can express the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final answer: Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she arrived home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over is:
66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

The total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes = 1/4 of the total boxes

To find the total number of boxes, we can set up the equation:
8 boxes = 1/4 * Total boxes

Solving for the total number of boxes:
Total boxes = 8 boxes * 4 = 32 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:
32 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 640 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 640 oranges = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept:
640 oranges - 160 oranges = 480 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 480 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Richard and Robert have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:

60 - 30 (Robert's cherries) - 20 (Richard's cherries) = 10 cherries for Jerry.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

30 (Robert's cherries) - 10 (Jerry's cherries) = 20 cherries.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Over 8 days, she will use:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle:

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. Therefore, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. Therefore, his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can calculate this as:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."

- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
- The total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

1. Calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. Calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.

4. Calculate the remaining soil for planting roses:
   - Total soil available = 30 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

5. Calculate the number of roses that can be planted:
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

$500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month with the amount she sets aside.

Now, we need to calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. Since she can't buy any pairs of shoes each month, the total number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

Net change in temperature: \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and the Comet orbits every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the Comet would be 75 years later. So, Bill's dad would be:

\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting for Bill is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (4 checks per year)

Now, let's calculate the total:

- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Church: 24 checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months)
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (1 check/quarter * 4 quarters)

Total checks per year = 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks

Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. The first plane's trips are split as follows:
   - 75% of the trips go to Greece.
   - The remaining 25% of the trips are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

3. Calculate the number of trips to Greece:
   \[
   0.75 \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips to Greece}
   \]

4. Calculate the number of trips that are not to Greece:
   \[
   88 - 66 = 22 \text{ trips}
   \]

5. These 22 trips are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, so:
   \[
   \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ trips to France}
   \]

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

\(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which means his father gave him $6 * 2 = $12.

The total cost of the trousers is $30. 

So, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost minus the amount given by his parents: $30 - ($6 + $12) = $30 - $18 = $12.

Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's express the total age equation with the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we can substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Total time spent on inpatients and appointments: 1.5 hours + 5 hours = 6.5 hours

Time left to update records: 9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Final numerical answer:
2.5"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- There are 10 students.

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:

- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- The total cost per session is $40.

So, the total cost per day is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:

- The studio is rented 3 days a week.

So, the total cost per week is:
\[ 120 \times 1 = 120 \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:

- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks.

So, the total cost per month is:
\[ 120 \times 4 = 480 \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(\boxed{1490}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:

Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
10 - 5 = 5 laps.

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Final numerical answer:
3"
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. This means there are 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, which totals to 5 albums. The remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but we don't need to know the exact distribution of these albums to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Since each of the 3 albums of selfies contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And since each of the 2 albums of portraits contains 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Final numerical answer:
45"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. He reads 18 pages. 

To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkout: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkout: 76 - 15 = 61
- Guests after afternoon check-in: 61 + 30 = 91
- Guests after dinner check-in: 91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:

4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the number of easy questions:
   - 40% of 60 questions are easy.
   - \( 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \) easy questions.

2. Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult.
   - Total questions - easy questions = \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) questions.

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from the cookies.

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from the cupcakes.

In total, she earned $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 * $10 = $20.

Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $320 - $20 = $300.

**$300**"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

30 (first twin) + 30 (second twin) = 60 eggs

This means that the number of eggs left for their friends to find is:

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by Smith twins) = 40 eggs

However, it's mentioned that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found:

40 (remaining eggs) - 10 (unfound eggs) = 30 eggs

So, the friends found 30 eggs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mined per day with each tool:**
   - With bare hands: 12 pounds per day.
   - With an iron pickaxe: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe: \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds per day.
   - In a month with 30 days, one dwarf mines \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - 40 dwarves each mine 1080 pounds in a month.
   - Therefore, the total ore mined is \(40 \times 1080 = 43200\) pounds.

**Final numerical answer:**
43200 pounds"
"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"First, let's calculate the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set:

Initial cost of the bedroom set: $3000
Amount received from selling old bedroom set: $1000

Remaining amount to be paid: $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of the remaining amount each month. So, the monthly payment is:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst:

- Sally started with 25 red balloons.
- 40% of the red balloons burst, so \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \) red balloons burst.
- Therefore, \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) red balloons remained.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:

- Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
- She released half of them, so \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) yellow balloons were released.
- Therefore, \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) yellow balloons remained.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons:

- Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.
- She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, so \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) blue balloons were added.
- Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.

Now, let's sum up the total number of balloons she carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (unchanged)
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total number of balloons = \( 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \)

Therefore, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 100%, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.6 - 0.5 \times 0.8 - 0.6 \times 0.8 + 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.48 + 0.24) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 76\% \]

Final answer:

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for guests: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (allocated seats) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. So, if he can eat 75 large jelly beans, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium-sized jelly beans.
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to multiply the number of medium-sized jelly beans by 3.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans."
"Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total number of hours she spends on jury duty is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She is paid $15 per day, so for 3 days, her total pay before expenses is:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, her total parking expenses are:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the parking expenses from her total pay gives her net pay:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net pay by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take for him to earn an equivalent amount of money with his new, higher income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's previous annual income was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked and gone to college:**
   - With a college degree, Jim's income is tripled.
   - His new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years and gone to college for 4 years.
   - Total amount earned with college = ($75,000 * 4) + ($25,000 * 4) = $300,000 + $100,000 = $400,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working:**
   - Total amount to be earned = Total amount borrowed + Total amount earned without college.
   - Total amount to be earned = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn the equivalent amount of money with his new income:**
   - Jim's new annual income = $75,000.
   - Time to earn $300,000 = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, one-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \). Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. So, twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \). Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the deliveries from each day:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters Monday - Wednesday."

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5 (a net loss of $10.5)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

So, the average loss per race is approximately $7.17.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total number of hours worked by the team.
3. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

First, let's find the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours the team worked each day. Since they worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day, and there are 24 hours in a day, the number of hours worked each day is:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of hours worked by the team over the 21 days:
\[ 21 \times 9 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find the number of hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter put in \(\boxed{47.25}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many tiles are needed to cover the kitchen floor.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.
- Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1ft \times 1ft = 1 SqFt\).
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 SqFt \div 1 SqFt/tile = 200 tiles\).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
- Each tile costs $12.
- The total cost is \(200 tiles \times $12/tile = $2400\).

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost. 

First, we calculate 60% of the normal cost:
60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
$120 + $72 = $192

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
$192 * 12 = $2,304

So, James pays $2,304 a year for his insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they would watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24 movies"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices.

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each person ate:

Becky: 10 slices
Jake: 7 slices
Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten: \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes (which is half an hour, so we divide the hourly rate by 2)
   - $300 / 2 = $150
3. Painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
   - $4 * 30 = $120
4. Parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours
   - $6 * 2 = $12

Now, we add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"James receives 80 emails a day. 20% of these emails don't require any response, which means 80 * 20% = 16 emails don't need a response each day.

The remaining emails that do require a response are 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.

In a 5-day work week, James responds to 64 * 5 = 320 emails.

Final numerical answer:
320"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

\[= 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all 4 tests and then divide by the number of tests.

John's scores are:
- 100 on the first test
- 100 on the second test
- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

Total score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4
Average score = 95

"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 

First, calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:
20 pizzas * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving:
20 pizzas - 14 pizzas = 6 pizzas

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is:
20 pizzas * 2 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered:
40 pizzas * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas, leaving:
40 pizzas - 32 pizzas = 8 pizzas

Adding the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
6 pizzas + 8 pizzas = 14 pizzas

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
14 pizzas"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost:

1. For the first pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the cost:

$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

The final cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"To determine the cost of Kayla's party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who couldn't come.
3. Determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the rental fee and the additional guests.

Let's start with the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we subtract the number of guests who couldn't come:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional guests there are beyond the initial 20:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the theater rental is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each of the 21 additional guests. So, the cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Finally, we add the rental fee to the cost of the additional guests to get the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza has $60 left.

The total amount of money they have left is:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Then, we can determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. This means the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Let's denote the number of bananas the first monkey eats each day as \( B_1 \), the second monkey as \( B_2 \), and the third monkey as \( B_3 \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( B_1 = 10 \) bananas per day.
- \( B_2 = B_1 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \) bananas per day.

The total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is:
\[ 7(B_1 + B_2 + B_3) = 315 \]

Substituting the values of \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \):
\[ 7(10 + 14 + B_3) = 315 \]
\[ 7(24 + B_3) = 315 \]
\[ 24 + B_3 = \frac{315}{7} \]
\[ 24 + B_3 = 45 \]
\[ B_3 = 45 - 24 \]
\[ B_3 = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she needs to make up the $5 is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

However, since she doesn't have enough money to cover the cost, she will not receive any change. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs to collect is:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks."

1. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for is \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.

"To calculate how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas versus buying 40 individual bananas (since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she bought 10 bunches).

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches of bananas:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.

\[ \text{Cost of 10 bunches} = 10 \times 3.00 = 30.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 40 individual bananas:
- Each individual banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny would need 40 bananas.

\[ \text{Cost of 40 individual bananas} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:

\[ \text{Money saved} = \text{Cost of 40 individual bananas} - \text{Cost of 10 bunches} \]
\[ \text{Money saved} = 32.00 - 30.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
2. Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
3. Sum up the earnings to get the total.

Let's start with step 1:

- Total bikes sold: 300
- Half of them were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes
- 15% were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \) BMX bikes
- The rest were MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes

Now, let's move to step 2:

- Price of an MTB: $500
- Price of a BMX: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
- Price of a Trekking bike: $450

Earnings from each type of bike:

- Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
- Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
- Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

Finally, for step 3, we sum up the earnings:

Total earnings: \( 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250 \)

So, Marcel earned a total of $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the farmer makes a total of:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the truck picks up a total of:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."

   Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time in a week is:
   \[
   100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent learning in a week:**
   - Total time spent in classes: 1600 minutes
   - Total extra learning time: 200 minutes

   So, the total time spent learning in a week is:
   \[
   1600 + 200 = 1800 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time spent learning into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - So, the total time in hours is:
   \[
   \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}
\]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
144"
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

After 3 hours, the distance covered by the first train is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

After 3 hours, the distance covered by the second train is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Final numerical answer:

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time for the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time for the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \).

2. Calculate the total amount needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed = \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - Number of years needed = \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \).

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement period of 20 years, living on 40% of her current annual salary."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts first, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take each of these 25 cm parts and divide them into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike per day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she plans to cover each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the total distance by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the distance she plans to hike from the distance she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each of the books cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Anna spent in total.
2. Calculate the cost of each book.

First, we know Anna's initial budget was $16 and she has $2 left after her purchase. So, the total amount she spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know she spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. Therefore, the amount she spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum overage is 1 hour).

Now, let's add up the time they all took to do their chores:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{mph} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by the 5 workers:**
   - The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, which means the 5 workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

5. **Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker produces 180 toys in 10 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{180}{10} = 18 \) toys per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:

\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers Luis had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."

First, we calculate the total weight of M&M's he has:
3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we determine how many M&M's he has in total:
30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's

If he puts 10 M&M's in each small bag, we can find out how many small bags he can make by dividing the total number of M&M's by the number of M&M's per small bag:
900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per small bag = 90 small bags

Final numerical answer:
90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is:
\[ 120 \, \text{mph} \times 5 = 600 \, \text{mph} \]

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so its speed is:
\[ 600 \, \text{mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 * $1.2 = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

Total amount of money they all have together: $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write:

\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since the sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile, the time it takes her to walk this distance is:

\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."
"Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. The amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The average temperature of the mixed water can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack contains 9 bagels. Therefore, the total number of bagels he gets is:

4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

The cost of each pack is $10.00, and he gets a 10% discount on the total cost for ordering 4 packs. The total cost before the discount is:

4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00

The discount is 10% of $40.00, which is:

10% * $40.00 = $4.00

So, the total cost after the discount is:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Now, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00/bagel

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel is $1.00."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write the proportion as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiplying gives \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - This simplifies to \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 27\).

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which totals to:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, which totals to:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Adding both periods together, Chester eats:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of men and women:

Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)

Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets.
4. Add the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales to the number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets.
5. Multiply the total by 3 to find out the number of sunflowers sold after 3 days.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day}
   \]

2. Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
   \[
   \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day}
   \]

3. Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
   \[
   7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day}
   \]

4. The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales and the sunflowers sold from the bouquets:
   \[
   13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers per day}
   \]

5. To find out the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:
   \[
   97 \times 3 = 291
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{291}

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes = 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes = 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes = 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, we sum up the days required for each size:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning with the second ticket. 

Given that the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, we can express this as a probability of 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60 or 60%.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning:

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets winning} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can write the equation for Carlos's seashells as:

\[ \text{Carlos's seashells} = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can write the equation for Carrey's seashells as:

\[ \text{Carrey's seashells} = \frac{\text{Carlos's seashells}}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by each person:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = \text{Jim's seashells} + \text{Carlos's seashells} + \text{Carrey's seashells} = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Finally, they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

\[ \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{\text{Total seashells}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

The total time for the cassette is the sum of the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

Total cassette time: 13 minutes"
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11,500 bottles

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
11,500 bottles - 4,200 bottles = 7,300 bottles

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7,300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. So, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters of land left (40 - 10 = 30).

4. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total amount from selling the remaining land is 30 * $3 = $90.

5. Adding up all the money he earned: $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the third sale) = $170.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."
"To find Geb's age, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

Let \( G \) be Geb's age and \( H \) be Haley's age. According to the problem, \( H = 26 \) and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. This can be written as:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Substituting Haley's age into the equation:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}(26) - 10 \]

\[ G = 13 - 10 \]

\[ G = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\(36 - 27 = 9\) eggs.

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[1248\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(x - 200\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Since a 10-year-old produces 1000 fruits, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old:

\[x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800\]

So, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old is 800.

Now, we can sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

2450"

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ R = 4B \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. First, we express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Then, we express \( R \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y + Y + Y - 28 - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
   \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

4. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

6. Now, we know that both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

"The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Half of the mural is yellow, so the yellow paint accounts for 6 pints (12 pints / 2 = 6 pints).

The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. Since the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is 6 pints (12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints), and these three colors are equal, we divide the 6 pints by 3.

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

So, 2 pints of red paint were used.

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the new box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the new box:**
   - The new box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount of money he uses is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}

- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals

"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. 

First, we calculate how much chalk was used on Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we find out how much chalk is left after Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to determine how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the amount of chalk left after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). The amount of chalk left after each day can be calculated as:
\[ C_{n+1} = C_n \times (1 - 0.20) = C_n \times 0.80 \]

We start with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches and want to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches.

We can set up the inequality:
\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

To solve for \( n \), we can take the logarithm of both sides:
\[ \log(2.75 \times (0.80)^n) < \log(2) \]
\[ \log(2.75) + n \log(0.80) < \log(2) \]
\[ n \log(0.80) < \log(2) - \log(2.75) \]
\[ n > \frac{\log(2) - \log(2.75)}{\log(0.80)} \]

Using a calculator to find the logarithms:
\[ \log(2) \approx 0.3010 \]
\[ \log(2.75) \approx 0.4394 \]
\[ \log(0.80) \approx -0.0969 \]

Now, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[ n > \frac{0.3010 - 0.4394}{-0.0969} \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.1384}{-0.0969} \]
\[ n > 1.43 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk was returned because it had passed the expiry date:

Fraction of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5

Gallons of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon:

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the $27000 is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which means 8 snowballs melt in an hour (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4, and 2 * 4 = 8).

So, the net increase in the number of snowballs Jay has after one hour is:
20 (built) - 8 (melted) = 12 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( t \) be the number of hours it takes for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

The net increase in snowballs per hour is 12, so:
\[ 12t = 60 \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old (28 - 20 = 8).

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4).

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now 24 years old (4 + 20 = 24).

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The discrepancy is \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages, which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than our initial calculation.

To find out how many bandages they started with, we need to subtract 31 from the 109 bandages we calculated:
\[109 - 31 = 78\]

So, the nurses started with 78 bandages on the first day.

**Final Answer:**
78"
"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

The final numerical answer is:
$100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he was paid for that task, and then sum up all the amounts.

- For doing his laundry once: $3.00
- For cleaning his room once: $1.50
- For taking the trash to the curb twice: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
- For emptying the dishwasher 6 times: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning his room) + $1.50 (trash) + $3.00 (dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two-week period."
"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If there are ten sharks, then the total amount of blood in ten sharks is:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

The number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into steps and sum the numbers accordingly.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we sum all these numbers:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Final numerical answer:
75"
"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

"On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer and put it in the refrigerator cooler.

- His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
  24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

- On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
  20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

- On the third day, his friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
  13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party, including Fred. So, the total number of people sharing the root beer is 3.

The amount of root beer available for each person to drink is:
  8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   Therefore, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Now, we calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Next, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses \(4\) colors from the stolen palette. This leaves her with \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors from that set. This leaves her with \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

19"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the first floor to the second floor (which is the same as the height of the second floor) is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

So, the total weight of the tunas is:
56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

The buying price is $72. 

Selling price = \( \frac{11}{8} \times 72 \)

Now, let's calculate the selling price:

Selling price = \( \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

So, the selling price is $99.

To find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Buying price
Profit = $99 - $72
Profit = $27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."

1. Calculate the total number of balloons:
   - They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
   - Each pack has 30 balloons.
   - Total balloons = 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. Calculate the number of balloons thrown:
   - They started with 300 balloons.
   - 12 balloons were left at the end of the afternoon.
   - Balloons thrown = Total balloons - Balloons left = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.

"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose.

For one dose:
- Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She combines 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in one dose is:
14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base with side lengths of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:

   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount Ali has to pay John:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = \$35 + \$40 = \$75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. So, we need to calculate 20% of $75 and subtract it from the total:
\[ \text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$75 = 0.20 \times \$75 = \$15 \]
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = \$75 - \$15 = \$60 \]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 nails on each hand, so she will have nail art on 20 nails in total. The cost for nail art per nail is $3:
\[ \text{Cost for nail art} = 20 \times \$3 = \$60 \]

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the total cost after the discount:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$60 + \$60 = \$120 \]

So, Karen would pay in all:
\[ \$120 \]"
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues per magazine. So, we need to consider the number of magazines as given in the problem statement:

- 3 magazines that send 12 issues each
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues

So, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

Final numerical answer:

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 32 \]
\[ \text{New price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the discounted price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. 

For the 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate, he will make:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%. So, the reduced rate is:
$80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60

For the 2 1-hour lessons at the reduced rate, he will make:
2 hours * $60/hour = $120

The total amount of money he will make for the day is:
$320 + $120 = $440

Total amount of money Charlie will make for the day: $440"

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"Walter initially bought 60 apples.

1. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he ate 24 apples.

2. The remaining apples after eating are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples.

4. The remaining apples after giving some to his sister are:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes to make grape juice, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. So, the mother used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes for the pies.

Therefore, at the beginning, there were 36 (used by Madeline and her brother) + 48 (used by the mother) = 84 grapes.

Final numerical answer:
84"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"To calculate how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs first:

1. **Pasta cost per week**: $1.00
2. **Cheddar cheese cost per week**: $3.00
3. **Gruyere cheese cost per week**: $3.00 * 2 = $6.00

Now, let's add up the weekly costs:
- Total weekly cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):

- Total yearly cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over 5 days.**

Working hours per day = 8 hours
Minutes per hour = 60

Total available time per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day

Total available time over 5 days = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time over 5 days = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Total available time per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

50%"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that can be held by one bookcase:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats.
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats.
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is the remaining hats after removing the red and blue ones, which is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats.

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. If the bag is $3.00 off, the cost per bag is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the cost per stick in cents, we first calculate the cost per stick in dollars and then convert it to cents.

Cost per stick in dollars = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:

$0.50 * 100 cents = 50 cents

Each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes is 96.

Final numerical answer:

"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights (one for each person).

There are 8 rooms in the house, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights

In total, combining the flashlights for the people and the rooms, they have:
4 (personal) + 16 (room) = 20 flashlights

For the candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, the total number of small candles is:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

And the total number of medium candles is:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

In total, combining the small and medium candles, they have:
16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 candles and flashlights

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is not specified, but since all 6 sides are required to have the Rubik's cube solved, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes."

"To return home, Phineas will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of that distance on land and the other half in water. This means he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

56 popsicle sticks ÷ 8 popsicle sticks/box = 7 boxes

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

7 boxes × $2.00/box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \). We know that \( 2x = 20 \), so \( x = 10 \).

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \).

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts daily.

He sells each doughnut for $2, so the daily revenue is 120 * $2 = $240.

June typically has 30 days, so the total revenue for June would be 30 * $240 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

She has a total of 210 photos to upload. To find out how many days she will need to upload all of her photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 cups of fresh lemon juice because his recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he would need twice the amount of lemon juice, which is 2 cups of fresh lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of fresh lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 lemons.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the kennel house will need in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds.
2. Calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs.
3. Add the daily food consumption of both types of dogs to get the total daily food consumption.
4. Multiply the total daily food consumption by 7 to get the weekly food consumption.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Daily food consumption for German Shepherds:
   - 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/day = 15 kg/day

2. Daily food consumption for Bulldogs:
   - 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/day = 6 kg/day

3. Total daily food consumption:
   - 15 kg/day (German Shepherds) + 6 kg/day (Bulldogs) = 21 kg/day

4. Weekly food consumption:
   - 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg/week

Therefore, the kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs and then divide by 2 to get the number of pairs.

2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
   - 15 animals × 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

3. Add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
   - 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs:
   - 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs

The total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. First, calculate the distance traveled west:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. Now, find the net distance from his house:
   - Distance traveled west = 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east = 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The final value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"To find the number of pink candies, let's first determine the number of each type of candy in the bag.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds.

So, the total weight is:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

1. Randy starts with:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Final numerical answer:
23"
"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net reduction per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes."
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

The Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final numerical answer is:
2"
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Total legs = 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

2. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Total screws needed = 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.

3. Calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.
   - Screws used = 32 screws.
   - Screws left over = 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first, so it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

The total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs."
"Alexandra raises $430.
Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raises $300.
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount of money they all raised, we add up the amounts:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

Given that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate Aaron's speed in minutes per mile as \( \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's. Therefore, Vanessa takes \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the time she took to complete her part of the race is \( 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. Number of reservations per night: 6
2. Meals ordered per reservation: 2
3. Cost of each meal: $5
4. Cost of a bottle of wine: $5
5. Number of nights the restaurant is open per week: 2

First, calculate the cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: 2 meals * $5 = $10
- Total cost per reservation (meals + wine): $10 + $5 = $15

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations per night:
- Total cost per night: 6 reservations * $15 = $90

Finally, calculate the total cost for the week:
- Total cost per week: $90 * 2 nights = $180

Therefore, the restaurant makes $180 a week if they are open 2 days a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\boxed{2.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

**8**"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, so 4 people in total):
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Each person can have 14 slices."
