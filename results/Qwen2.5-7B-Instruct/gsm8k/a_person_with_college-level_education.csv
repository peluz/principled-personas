"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Subtracting the used eggs from the total laid eggs gives:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."

**Final Answer: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Cost of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 150% = 1.5, and the original value is 1, so 1 + 1.5 = 2.5).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, in one session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Next, since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, calculate the cost of the second glass:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how many glasses are in each price category. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, half of them will be at the full price and the other half at the reduced price:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ glasses at full price} \]
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ glasses at reduced price} \]

Now, calculate the total cost for the glasses at full price:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, calculate the total cost for the glasses at the reduced price:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 40 + 24 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered in 0.5 hours = \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).
   - He then drives the remaining time (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered in 1.5 hours = \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered in the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initially, John was 180 miles away from home.
   - After the return trip, he has covered 135 miles towards home.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

**Final Answer:**
Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

The total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
\[
\text{Net Profit per Year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Next, we need to find the number of years \( n \) it will take for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
\text{Total Net Profit} = 7.5n
\]

We set this equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point:
\[
7.5n = 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

"To find the original price of the book, we can use the information that Kyle bought it for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

This means the second stop was at the 45-mile mark. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (at 20 miles) and the second stop (at 45 miles):
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on this daily care over the course of a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

**Final Answer:**
70"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of jewels Siobhan has based on the information given about the number of jewels Raymond and Aaron have.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:**
   - John has 13 lego sets.
   - Each lego set is sold for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = \(13 \times 15 = 195\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total cost of video games = \(8 \times 20 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:**
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - This means the money left after buying the video games is $5.

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Total money from selling lego sets = $195.
   - Total cost of video games = $160.
   - Money left = $195 - $160 = $35.
   - According to the problem, John has $5 left, which means there might be a discrepancy in the problem statement or an additional context not considered. However, based on the given information, we will proceed with the provided $5 left.

5. **Determine how many lego sets John still has:**
   - Since John sold all his lego sets initially and the problem does not mention any lego sets being bought or sold after the initial transaction, he should have no lego sets left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, John's running speed is \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the specified time allocations for running and walking.

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is half of her skipping speed.
   \[
   \text{Running speed} = \frac{3 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed.
   \[
   \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1.5 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 0.375 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time available is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time is spent running.
   \[
   \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking.
   \[
   \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled while running:**
   \[
   \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking:**
   \[
   \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 0.375 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ miles}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram provides 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
     \[
     \text{Grams} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/g}} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, after using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the two components of her pension: the fixed annual pension and the additional 5% of the value of the pension based on her years of service.

1. **Fixed Annual Pension:**
   - Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.

2. **Additional Pension Based on Years of Service:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension is $50,000.
   - 5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]

3. **Total Annual Pension After 30 Years:**
   - After 30 years, she has been working for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.
   - The additional pension for each of these 10 years is $2,500.
   - Therefore, the total additional pension is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]
   - Adding the fixed annual pension and the additional pension:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information given.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. We can calculate the car's fuel efficiency as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know the car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far Sophia can drive on a full 12-gallon tank of gas:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent each week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."

"To solve this problem, let's define the amount of laundry each person does in terms of a variable.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( 100 \) pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way versus the less economical way.

"Let's define the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is given as 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \( 8,000 \) copies.

**Final Answer:**
Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest who shows up. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Christina will spend:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that both the adults and the children will eat.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
- Each adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
- Each child will eat half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \).
- There are 5 children.

\[
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:

\[
200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Cindy's Pets:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Marcia's Pets:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pets}
   \]

3. **Jan's Pets:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has:
   \[
   3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets}
   \]

4. **Total Pets:**
   To find the total number of pets, we add the number of pets each person has:
   \[
   4 \text{ (Cindy)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia)} + 18 \text{ (Jan)} = 28
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[
\boxed{28}

"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children based on the information given.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age = \( A \)
   - Jackson's age = \( J \)
   - Corey's age = \( C \)
   - James's age = 10

2. From the problem, we know:
   - Amy is 10 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 10 \)
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \)
   - James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey: \( C = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. Using the value of Corey's age, we can find Amy's age:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Now, using Amy's age, we can find Jackson's age:
   \[
   A = J + 10 \implies 9 = J + 10 \implies J = 9 - 10 = -1
   \]

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem since ages cannot be negative. Let's recheck the relationships and calculations:

- Corey is 11 years old.
- Amy is 9 years old (since \( A = C - 2 \)).
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so:
  \[
  A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5 \implies J = 9 - 5 = 4
  \]

Thus, Jackson is 4 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means his new time is 90% of his original time. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{348}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. Given that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We are given that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes in one can**: Since the sauce made from one can of tomatoes is 32 ounces and this is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can, the volume of tomatoes in one can is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. We need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes and the total volume of tomatoes is 64 ounces, we need to find out how many cans were used. However, we already know the volume of tomatoes per can is 64 ounces, so we can directly use the number of tomatoes per can.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used**: Since each can contains 3 tomatoes and we need to find out how many cans were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we can use the fact that each can provides 64 ounces of tomatoes. Therefore, the number of cans used is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{32 \text{ ounces per can}} = 2 \text{ cans}
   \]
   Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   2 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 6 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This can be written as:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = \text{total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam} \]

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit, we have:
\[ x + 20 - 5 = 30 - 5 \]
\[ x + 15 = 25 \]
\[ x = 25 - 15 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away:

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can calculate the number of potted plants she will have left after giving some away:

The number of plants she will have left is the initial number of plants minus the number of plants she gives away:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary also received 18 new potted plants, so we need to add these to the remaining plants:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

**Final Answer:**
6 pages per day"
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 5 weekdays, he drinks \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - However, he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 2 weekend days, he drinks \(4 \times 2 = 8\) glasses of water.

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, we get \(20 + 8 = 28\) glasses of water.

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is **28**."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

### Step 1: Determine the inner dimensions of one box
Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions will be reduced by 2 inches in each dimension (1 inch from each side).

- **Length (inner):** \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- **Width (inner):** \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- **Height (inner):** \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 4 - 2 = 2\) inches

### Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of one box
The inner volume \(V\) of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes
Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is:
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

### Final Answer
The total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- **Monday and Tuesday**: 1 hour each night.
  - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

- **Thursday**: 1 hour and a 30-minute show.
  - Total for Thursday: \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.

- **Friday**: Two 1-hour episodes.
  - Total for Friday: \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.

- **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: \(2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\) hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
\[ \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer:**
3"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each of them ate.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Next, we find the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice combined:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance to the shore:**
   Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can find the total distance by setting up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ seconds}}{20 \text{ feet}} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{x \text{ feet}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{64 \text{ seconds} \times 20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate of water intake:**
   The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total cost of all boards:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $10.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $16.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total revenue from all boards:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
   - Total revenue = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = \$180 - \$180 = \$0.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the given ratio and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

We know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. This total is made up of 20 parts according to the ratio. Therefore, each part of the ratio corresponds to:

\[
\frac{120 \text{ teaspoons}}{20 \text{ parts}} = 6 \text{ teaspoons per part}
\]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, the total amount of sugar used is:

\[
7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[
\boxed{42}

   \]

2. Next, calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of vehicles that were initially at the port. The customs officer counted 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the initial number of vehicles is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Adrien's current salary = \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary = \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary = $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary = $43,076.92.
   - Total salary = \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

"First, let's determine how many letters Jennie stamped. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are now added to the pile of already-stamped letters. Initially, there were some letters in the already-stamped pile, and after adding the 20 newly stamped letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

"Let's define the variables for the different types of bees:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

Next, we need to determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn \(\boxed{140}\) dollars in one week."
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 60 bees (since every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns in the last 6 hours)

So, the number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is the same as the number of bees that left in the first 60 bees, which is 60 bees.

**Final Answer:**
60 bees"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means that the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has first, and then use that information to find out how many friends James has.

1. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

2. According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]

3. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

4. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will wait for Tim:
- Difference in time: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - He has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - He has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to get the total weekly hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ \boxed{272} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these together gives the total length:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet."

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas' Requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons' Requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Now, we sum the total bananas required for all the apes over 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ bananas} + 800 \text{ bananas} + 200 \text{ bananas} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

**Final Answer:**
The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distances they run is:

\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"To determine how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, Finn watches 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 of these tadpoles come out from under a lily pad. This means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6.
3. After that, 2 of the tadpoles hide under a rock. This means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see now:

- Initially, he sees 11 tadpoles.
- After 6 more come out, he sees \(11 + 6 = 17\) tadpoles.
- After 2 hide under a rock, he sees \(17 - 2 = 15\) tadpoles.

So, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

15

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

15"

1. **Initial Depth on Monday**: The tank has a depth of 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday**: The tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday**: The depth of the water on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Express the price increase as a multiplier:**
   - A 20% increase means the price is multiplied by \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \) every two months.

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - \( \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \)

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   - The price after each period is given by \( P_n = P_0 \times (1.20)^n \), where \( n \) is the number of periods.
   - For \( n = 18 \):
     \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
     \]

5. **Compute the value of \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]

6. **Calculate the final price:**
   - \[
     P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
     \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\$787.32\)."
"To solve this problem, let's first establish the values of the toys based on the information given.

1. We know that one red car costs $4.
2. We are also told that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
3. We are given that an action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the value of the doll:
- Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total value of all the toys:
- The value of the 5 red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The value of the 3 action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The value of the doll is 15 dollars.

Adding these values together gives us the total value of all the toys:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."

1. **Calculate the lost income from not doing freelance work:**
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour of freelance work.
   - She will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the total lost income is \( 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from not doing freelance work is $105.

3. **Determine the net difference:**
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will spend $90.
   - She would have lost $105 in freelance income if she did her taxes herself.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum these costs:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Let's add them step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[ 1654 - 1500 = 154 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans, the total number of eggs needed is:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays = \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends = \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Total miles = miles walked on weekdays + miles walked on weekends.

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time spent peeling one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time spent peeling all the potatoes is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent cutting one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time spent cutting all the potatoes is:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent peeling and cutting:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"

"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel, and then determine how much he has left after these expenses.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   - Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   - Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Therefore, Monic has \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) crabs.

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   - Therefore, Rani has \( 36 + 10 = 46 \) crabs.

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   - Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
   - Total crabs = \( 40 + 36 + 46 \)

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - \( 40 + 36 = 76 \)
   - \( 76 + 46 = 122 \)

The total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = 8 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\$130\) for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 20."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first establish the number of white carnations ordered by Sandra. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]
Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, so:
\[
14 + 5 = 19
\]
This means that two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, currently, Mark is:
\[
19 + 2 = 21
\]
Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is:
\[
21 + 2 = 23
\]

The final answer is:
\[

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the slower team is:

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then find the difference between them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Difference in Probabilities
Now, we find the difference in probabilities:
\[ \text{Difference} = P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage:
\[ 0.25 \times 100\% = 25\% \]

### Final Answer

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the compounded interest over these months.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal as 0.02.

The formula for the amount after \( n \) months with monthly compounding interest is:
\[ A = P (1 + r)^n \]
where:
- \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) months,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate,
- \( n \) is the number of months.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P = 100 \]
\[ r = 0.02 \]
\[ n = 3 \]

So, the amount after 3 months is:
\[ A = 100 (1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 (1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:
\[ \boxed{106.12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The total profit from selling \( x \) bags is given as $400. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"

2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. Therefore, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[

5. **Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average. The lowest score among 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 is 71.**

6. **Remove the lowest score (71) and calculate the new total score:**
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]

7. **Add the sixth test score \( x \) to the new total score:**
   \[
   367 + x
   \]

8. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total kilometers for the first four weeks can be calculated as:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total kilometers for the next three weeks can be calculated as:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

**Total Kilometers:**
To find the total kilometers Micheal rode over the seven weeks, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Since there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, the weight of each candied apple is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one dozen cups be \( C \).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 20C \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - This can be written as:
     \[
     20C = 6000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   20C = 4800
   \]

5. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   C = \frac{4800}{20} = 240
   \]

6. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - Since \( C \) is the cost of one dozen cups, the cost of one cup is:
     \[
     \frac{C}{12} = \frac{240}{12} = 20
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.
- Sara already has $10 saved.

The total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is the sum of her savings, her earnings from babysitting, and her earnings from mowing the lawn:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42.
2. The number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens can be expressed as:
- Red chickens produce \( 3r \) eggs a day.
- White chickens produce \( 5w \) eggs a day.

Since the total number of eggs collected each day is 42, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( r = 4 \).

To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs produced would be:
\[ 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]
This matches the given total of 42 eggs per day.

Therefore, the number of red chickens is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles/hour) into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of customers on the second day:**
   - Sloane counts 100 customers on the first day.
   - On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

2. **Calculate the total number of customers over the first two days:**
   - The total number of customers on the first and second days is \(100 + 150 = 250\).

3. **Determine the number of customers on the third day:**
   - The total number of customers by the third day is 500.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - 250 = 250\).

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons and in the small pool as \( S \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that currently, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of roses**: There are 4 roses in the vase.
2. **Number of dahlias**: There are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, the number of dahlias is \(4 + 7 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(2 \times 21 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

Now, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Finally, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles to find the total time spent:
- Total time = Time spent on crossword puzzles + Time spent on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 30% of 120
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**: 
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**: 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**: 
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine the total cost Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so the tax on the cars is:

   - After using 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
   - Therefore, from 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) full pens.
   - Now, he has 5 new full pens and 0 empty pens.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling:**
   - He uses these 5 new full pens, which will leave him with 5 empty pens.
   - He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
   - Now, he has 1 new full pen and 0 empty pens.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling:**
   - He uses this 1 new full pen, which will leave him with 1 empty pen.
   - He cannot make any more full pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.

So, after the first cycle, he has 5 new full pens, and after the second cycle, he has 1 more full pen. Adding these to the original 25 pens, the total number of pens he has is:
\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Selling Price**: $400,000

2. **Transfer Fees**: 3% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: $250,000

Next, we calculate the total expenses:
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Transfer Fees} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Remaining Loan Amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
\]

Finally, we calculate the net proceeds by subtracting the total expenses from the selling price:
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses}
\]
\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
\]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{118,000}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Given: 20 minutes.

2. **Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:**
   - Sum of all times: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

**Final Answer:**
71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:
- The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the newspaper ads is \( 5 \times 50 = 250 \) dollars.

2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags to find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought:

\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his memorization and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

Now, we sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]

- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total for each type of activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

**Total Squats:**
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
- Total pushups: 220
- Total squats: 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 60

Total count of activities = 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for the household:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) of rice per day.
   - There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption for the household:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg} \times 7 = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

So, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids, given that she bids after each of the three other bidders and the bids increase by $50 each time.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **First Additional Bid**: The first other bidder bids, and Carmen bids $50 more than the previous highest bid.
3. **Second Additional Bid**: The second other bidder bids, and Carmen bids $50 more than the previous highest bid.
4. **Third Additional Bid**: The third other bidder bids, and Carmen bids $50 more than the previous highest bid.

Let's calculate each of Carmen's bids:

- **First Bid by Carmen**: $200 + $50 = $250
- **Second Bid by Carmen**: $250 + $50 = $300
- **Third Bid by Carmen**: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen wins the auction with her third bid, which is $350.

Therefore, the total cost of the desk to Carmen is **$350**."
"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost based on the miles driven and the monthly bonus.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, and he drives to work and back each day.
   - Therefore, each day he drives \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles.
   - He works 5 days a week, so in a week, he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.
   - He works 50 weeks a year, so in a year, he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.

2. **Calculate the cost based on the miles driven:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile.
   - Therefore, the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total bonus paid in a year:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can print four pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires four pages per piece of paper, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of books**: 250
2. **Books sold this year**: 45
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50
4. **Books sold in the first year**: twice the number sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\)

Now, let's calculate the number of books sold in the second year. We know the total number of books sold over the three years is the total number of books minus the unsold books:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

The total number of books sold over the three years is the sum of the books sold in each year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold in the third year} = 200 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 90 + \text{Books sold in the second year} + 45 = 200 \]

Solving for the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ 90 + \text{Books sold in the second year} + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 135 + \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 135 \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings, including the bonus, are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month of April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made:

\[ \$3200 \]

in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning.

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weekly weight loss for Joey as follows:

\[ \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Sandy loses weight at a rate that allows her to lose 2 pounds per 4 weeks, we can calculate the total weeks required for Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Sandy's total weeks to lose 8 pounds} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/4 weeks}} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2
   - For 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

2. **Savings from buying milk:**
   - Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
   - For 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

3. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings = Savings from ice cream + Savings from milk
   - Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum causes an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum causes an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is calculated by dividing 15 by 5:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)}
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   - Total cost for business suits = \(6 \times 100 = 600\) dollars.

2. **Cost of suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of one business suit = $100.
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = \(5 \times 100 = 500\) dollars.
   - Total cost of the flight ticket = \(500 + 700 = 1200\) dollars.

4. **Total expenses so far:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of the flight ticket
   - Total expenses = \(600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950\) dollars.

5. **Amount Theo wants to save:**
   - Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Total amount Theo has:**
   - Theo has $6000 initially.

7. **Amount left for gifts:**
   - Amount left for gifts = Total amount Theo has - Total expenses - Amount Theo wants to save
   - Amount left for gifts = \(6000 - 1950 - 2000 = 2050\) dollars.

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{2050}\) dollars on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

So, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Cera's Current Age**: Cera is currently 46 years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago**: Let Noah's current age be \( N \). Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \).

3. **Cera's Age Six Years Ago**: Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years old.

4. **Relationship Between Noah and Cera Six Years Ago**: According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   N - 6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   N - 6 = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( N \):
   \[
   N = 20 + 6 = 26
   \]
   So, Noah is currently 26 years old.

5. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago**: Let the current population of Chile be \( P \). Six years ago, the population was \( \frac{P}{2} \).

6. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago in Terms of Noah's Age**: The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Noah's age six years ago was 20, so:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times 20
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 60000
   \]
   Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000

Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{30}

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments from the total number of people invited:
\[
24 - 8 - 2 = 14

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be represented as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the 2 loose pencils are part of the total, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

So, Jam has 24 pencils in boxes and 2 loose pencils, making a total of 26 pencils.

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 3 boxes to store all their pencils.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed:**

   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening due to the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening due to the cream:**
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Total weakening:**
   The total weakening of the coffee is the sum of the weakening due to the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job pays more net income, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

1. \( C + H = 60 \)
2. \( H = 2C \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to find the number of cows:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle by the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]
\[ 4 \text{ (remaining balls)} - 1 \text{ (lost ball)} = 3 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together, we get:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}\]

Including the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
\[240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \(\boxed{260}\)."

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for one friend (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for one friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for one friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, over 5 days she will save:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy buys.
   - The cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars.
   - Billy starts with $10, so the amount of money left after buying the candy is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - The amount of money he takes is \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} \).
   - Each gumball costs $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs.
   - The total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

3. **Set up the equation for the money spent on gumballs:**
   - The money spent on gumballs is equal to half of the remaining money after buying the candy.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   -1.5x = 4 - 10
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -1.5x = -6
   \]
   Divide both sides by -1.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{-6}{-1.5} = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance traveled:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year), the interest rate is:
\[ 10\% \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{5}{120} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.041667 \]

The interest on the principal amount of $3,650 for five months is:
\[ 3650 \times 0.041667 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:
\[ 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."

- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance hiked by Chloe:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance hiked by Cho} - \text{Distance hiked by Chloe} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total number of pesos they have together.

The total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total time:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The problem states that the choir decides to perform with just its female members. Therefore, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

However, on the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Thus, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}

"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the cost of buying a ride bracelet versus buying individual ride tickets.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha, who buys individual ride tickets:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- There are 9 rides.
- Each ticket costs $2.

The total number of tickets Dasha needs is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets} \]

The total cost for Dasha's tickets is:
\[ 18 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$36 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for David, who buys a ride bracelet:
- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

The total cost for David is:
\[ \$30 \]

Now, we compare the costs:
- Dasha's total cost: \$36
- David's total cost: \$30

The amount of money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:

- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Total number of gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make a bow for each of the 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \text{Inches of ribbon per bow} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per bow} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The bundle discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable subscription and getting the bundled streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording the song: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours

"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices given away:
\[ 4 \text{ slices (to Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (to Mark)} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract these from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 7 \text{ slices} - 2 \text{ slices (eaten by Jenny)} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the number of spiders. So, the number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \).
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \).

Now, we add up all the bugs:
- Spiders: 90
- Millipedes: 30
- Stink bugs: 48

The total number of bugs is \( 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The new daily energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

   \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches:
   \[
   \text{Meat needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cheese needed} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pounds of meat is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he has before he needs to leave is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can now calculate how many minutes early he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining in June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for every 1.5 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (which is half off $3).

For 2 pounds of taffy, Sally will pay for 1.5 pounds and get the second pound at half price:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the initial amount:
\[ 10.00 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3.00} \]"
"To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks.
2. Calculate the total cost of the fireworks before the discount.
3. Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the fireworks.
4. Add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total cost of the fireworks.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The cost of the first pack of fireworks is $400. The second pack costs twice that amount:
   \[
   2 \times 400 = 800
   \]

2. The total cost of the fireworks before the discount is the sum of the costs of the two packs:
   \[
   400 + 800 = 1200
   \]

3. Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
   \[
   0.20 \times 1200 = 240
   \]
   Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:
   \[
   1200 - 240 = 960
   \]

4. Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted total cost of the fireworks:
   \[
   960 + 150 = 1110
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since the problem does not provide any information about the overlap between the two conditions (smelling like wet dog and exploding), we assume that the events are independent. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) \times 50,000 = \frac{1 \times 5}{100 \times 100} \times 50,000 = \frac{5}{10,000} \times 50,000 = 2.5 \]

Since the number of candles must be a whole number, we round 2.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 3.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. This means each blouse is now 70% of its original price (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price. We do this by multiplying the discount price of one blouse by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{km} = 240 \, \text{km} \).

3. **The 7th day:**
   - He did not travel at all.
   - Distance for the 7th day: \( 0 \, \text{km} \).

4. **Second week (days 8 to 14):**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \).

Now, let's sum up all the distances:

- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- 7th day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

Total distance traveled:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}
\]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's locker size**: We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. **Zack's locker size**: Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4.
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. **Timothy's locker size**: Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2.
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the elevation of Stanley's comb.
2. Identify the elevation of Oliver.
3. Calculate the difference in elevation between Oliver and Stanley's comb.

First, Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet. Therefore, the elevation of the comb is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:
\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the two banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to Mr. Josue's initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Later, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

The final number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we add up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{284}

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations to represent the savings from each type of jeans:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know that the tattered jeans cost $28, so \( T = 28 \). The jogger jeans cost $22 on sale, so the savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \). According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so:
\[ J - 22 = 2 \]
\[ J = 24 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. The difference in the original prices is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

1. Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
2. The money he gets from selling the cards is \( \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 \) dollars.
3. After buying the ticket for $100, he has $50 left for spending cash. Therefore, the money he gets from selling the cards minus the cost of the ticket equals $50.

We can set up the following equation based on the information provided:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 - 100 = 50 \]

First, simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = x \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ x - 100 = 50 \]

Next, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 50 + 100 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with \( \boxed{150} \) cards."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - Therefore, 18 guests were prepared to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were prepared to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - In total, the caterer prepared \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Guests and Consumption:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the first 18 guests would need an additional 18 hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests) each wanted 1 hotdog.

3. **Total Hotdogs Needed:**
   - The first 18 guests need 36 hotdogs (18 hotdogs initially + 18 additional hotdogs).
   - The remaining 22 guests need 22 hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

4. **Hotdogs Available vs. Needed:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs are needed.
   - The shortfall is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

5. **Guests Without a Second Hotdog:**
   - Since the first 18 guests were prepared to have 2 hotdogs each, they will all get their first hotdog and 4 of them will get a second hotdog.
   - The remaining 14 of the first 18 guests will not get a second hotdog.
   - The 22 remaining guests will also not get a second hotdog because there are not enough hotdogs left.

6. **Total Guests Without a Second Hotdog:**
   - 14 guests from the first 18 and all 22 of the remaining guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of guests without a second hotdog is \( 14 + 22 = 36 \).

**Final Answer:**
36 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew \(\boxed{30}\) dragons."
"First, let's determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container holds:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons is equivalent to:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - George spent $5 in total.
   - He had 1% of his money left after buying the chips.
   - Therefore, 99% of his money was spent on the chips and candy bars.

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on the chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40.
   - Total cost for the chips: \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money George had left after buying the chips:**
   - Since 1% of his money was left, and he spent 99% of his money, the 1% left is the remaining money.
   - Let \(x\) be the total amount of money George had initially.
   - 1% of \(x\) is the amount left, which is \(0.01x\).
   - The amount spent is \(0.99x\), and we know this is $1.20 (the cost of the chips) plus the cost of the candy bars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent is $1.20 (chips) plus the cost of the candy bars.
   - Let \(y\) be the number of candy bars George bought.
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75.
   - Total cost for the candy bars: \(0.75y\).
   - Therefore, the equation for the total amount spent is: \(1.20 + 0.75y = 0.99x\).

5. **Calculate the initial amount of money George had:**
   - We know that \(0.01x\) is the amount left, and it is the remaining 1% of $5.
   - So, \(0.01x = 0.05\).
   - Solving for \(x\): \(x = \frac{0.05}{0.01} = 5\).

6. **Substitute \(x\) back into the equation to find \(y\):**
   - We have \(1.20 + 0.75y = 0.99 \times 5\).
   - Simplify the right side: \(0.99 \times 5 = 4.95\).
   - So, the equation becomes: \(1.20 + 0.75y = 4.95\).
   - Subtract 1.20 from both sides: \(0.75y = 3.75\).
   - Solve for \(y\): \(y = \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5\).

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."

"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 9 minutes before Wayne starts his journey.

Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes (her travel time) plus 9 minutes (the time before Wayne arrives) earlier than Wayne. This gives us:

\[ 16 + 9 = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 25 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room in feet. We know the area of the room and the length, and we need to convert the length from yards to feet since 1 yard = 3 feet.

Given:
- Area of the room = 360 square feet
- Length of the room = 3 yards = 3 * 3 = 9 feet

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth's total is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, Margareth's total is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the current temperature:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time for James is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also uses 2 additional eggs that were loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new totals to determine by how many points Joey is winning.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

**Final Answer:**
Joey is winning by 5 points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the case.

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars."

"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost with the super ticket:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost without the super ticket:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket.
   - So, we can set up the equation: $21 - $2 = $15 + P
   - Simplifying, we get: $19 = $15 + P
   - Solving for \( P \): \( P = $19 - $15 = $4 \)

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We do this by multiplying the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, calculate the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, she receives 2 rubies in the trade. Now, we need to calculate the total value of her remaining sapphires and rubies.

The value of the remaining sapphires is:

\[ 5 \text{ sapphires} \times \$800 \text{ per sapphire} = \$4000 \]

The value of the rubies is:

\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \times \$1200 \text{ per ruby} = \$2400 \]

2. Add the amounts together to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Each person eats 4 apples a day.
- In 30 days, each person eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Now, let's add the amounts together:
- Marin eats 120 apples.
- Nancy eats 120 apples.
- Together, they eat \(120 + 120 = 240 \text{ apples}\).

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"

   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7.

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - Percentage of puppies with spots = \(\frac{\text{Total number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \times 100\)
   - Percentage of puppies with spots = \(\frac{7}{20} \times 100\)

4. **Perform the division and multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{7}{20} = 0.35\)
   - \(0.35 \times 100 = 35\)

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is **35%**."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her weekly earnings from recycling cans and bottles, and then multiply that by four.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from cans are \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}\).

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Therefore, her weekly earnings from bottles are \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\).

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles:
- Her total weekly earnings are \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\).

Finally, to find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Her total earnings for a four-week month are \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Therefore, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

   - Therefore, the initial total number of pencils is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.
   - The number of pencils used is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \).

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - The number of pencils remaining is \( 300 - 60 = 240 \).

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.
   - The number of pencils left is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \).

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we'll convert the remoras' length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long. Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. 

Final answer:
\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \)."
"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he will be walking over the three weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, over three weeks, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. Over three weeks, the total number of days he will walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

The total time he needs to spend walking to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days he will be walking:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids. Sarah has 4 kids, so we divide 20 by 4:
\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

   - Total employees = \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each group has 7 tour guides, and there are 3 groups.
   - Total tour guides = \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides
   - Total people = \(600 + 21 = 621\).

The total number of people going on this tour is **621**."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Plane Tickets Cost:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend.
   - The increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 \times 0.20 = 300
     \]
   - Therefore, the total price per day during the busy weekend is:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Trip:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel cost gives:
     \[
     10000 + 5400 = 15400
     \]

The total cost of the trip is \(\boxed{15400}\)."

Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben:
\[ \text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint:
\[ \text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 11 \]"
"To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to determine the weight of each penny and then sum them up.

1. **Weight of the 1959 penny:**
   The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. **Weight of the 2010 penny:**
   The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

3. **Combined weight of the two pennies:**
   Now, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}

"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first calculate the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ \text{Songs Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ \text{Songs Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ \text{Difference} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the given information and setting up the equation based on the problem statement.

1. Jillian's shoes cost $80.
2. The handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

Let's denote the cost of the handbag as \( H \) and the cost of the shoes as \( S \). Given that \( S = 80 \), we can express the cost of the handbag as:
\[ H = 3S - 20 \]

Substituting the value of \( S \) into the equation:
\[ H = 3 \times 80 - 20 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and subtraction:
\[ H = 240 - 20 \]
\[ H = 220 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total miles James runs in a week:**
   James runs 12 miles each day for 5 days a week.
   \[
   \text{Total miles per week} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 60 \, \text{miles/week}
   \]

2. **Determine the time it takes to run 10 miles:**
   James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to run 10 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   For 10 miles at 10 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{10 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 1 \, \text{hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total hours James runs in a week:**
   Since it takes 1 hour to run 10 miles, we need to find out how many 10-mile segments are in 60 miles.
   \[
   \text{Number of 10-mile segments} = \frac{60 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{miles/segment}} = 6 \, \text{segments}
   \]
   Therefore, the total time James runs in a week is:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per week} = 6 \, \text{segments} \times 1 \, \text{hour/segment} = 6 \, \text{hours}
   \]

"To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total capacity of the trays.
2. Subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays to find out how many eggs won't be placed.

First, calculate the total capacity of the trays:
\[ 2 \text{ trays} \times 24 \text{ eggs per tray} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, subtract the total number of eggs from the total capacity of the trays:
\[ 48 \text{ eggs (capacity)} - 64 \text{ eggs (available)} = -16 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Jaime has more eggs than the trays can hold. Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be placed is:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.

5. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is **25 cents**."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid is determined by the height of the topmost person, as they are the highest point.

The height of the human pyramid is therefore 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Angela is 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we find the total number of oranges both Brianne and Ashley brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we can determine the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed per pie:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ n = 10 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Next, we substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Now, solve for \(D\):
\[4D = 36\]
\[D = 9\]

Now that we have \(D\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16\]
\[B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18\]

To verify, we check the total:
\[L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43\]

The number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry and one pack each of grape and green apple.

We know the following:
- The cost of one pack of grape gum is $2.
- The cost of one pack of green apple gum is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all four packs of gum is $7.

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 2 = 7 \]
\[ 2x + 4 = 7 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 3 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 1.5 \]

"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks).

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ \$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$22.00/\text{week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of not having the pass and the cost of the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo based on the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo would have:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm based on the information that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm would have:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information given about Rose's purchases.

First, let's summarize the information:
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):
\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Therefore, the amount of money Julie had left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money can be calculated as follows:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \]

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate of one person painting a house is therefore \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house per day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house per day.

To find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we take the reciprocal of their combined rate:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:**

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - If \( C_J \) is the number of chairs Jenna has, then:
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - If \( S_J \) is the number of sofas Jenna has, then:

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of one monitor:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back from the scavenger hunt.

First, we know that the total number of kids is 20, and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought back 60 seashells. According to the problem, each girl brought back an amount of seashells equal to the number of shells brought by a boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \).

The problem states that:
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Now, we calculate the right-hand side of the equation:
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

So, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original candies George had} - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Nick had as follows:

\[ \text{Candies Nick had} = 2 \times \text{Original candies George had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \, \text{mm} - 5 \, \text{mm} = 45 \, \text{mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \, \text{mm} = 62 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm}
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the total thickness of the four books is:
\[
\boxed{188}

"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total bill including the tip.
2. Determine your share of the bill.

First, let's calculate the total bill including the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill.

\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the total bill is:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill, you are paying 120% of the original bill.

\[ \text{Your share} = 1.20 \times 50 = 60 \]

Therefore, you end up paying:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending $8:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month and understand the saving pattern.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount saved in the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

In the second half of April, Elvis saves twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half. The total amount saved in the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, the amount he saves each day in the second half is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought:

1. **Apples:**
   - Number of apples: 3
   - Cost per apple: $1.50
   - Total cost for apples: \( 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \)

2. **Oranges:**
   - Number of oranges: 5
   - Cost per orange: $0.80
   - Total cost for oranges: \( 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \)

3. **Peaches:**
   - Number of peaches: 6
   - Cost per peach: $0.75
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \)

Next, we add up the total costs of all the fruits:

\[
4.50 \, (\text{apples}) + 4.00 \, (\text{oranges}) + 4.50 \, (\text{peaches}) = 13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is:

\[
\boxed{7.00}

\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Cost of five notebooks: \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\)
- Cost of two pens: \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\)
- Cost of one calculator: \(1 \times \$12 = \$12.00\)
- Cost of one geometry set: \(1 \times \$10 = \$10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30.00 = 0.10 \times \$30.00 = \$3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[
\$30.00 - \$3.00 = \$27.00
\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\$27.00\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount = $1000 * 30% = $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount = $1500 * 10% = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450.

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is **$450**."

   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars per tooth.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of **$9.00**."

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, the daily spending amount is:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

left to spend from Thursday through Sunday. He will spend his remaining money on plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Next, we calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.

2. **First Operation**: The starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
   - Since the starting value is 20, half of 20 is 10.
   - So, the expression becomes \((20 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6\).

3. **Second Operation**: The resulting value from the first operation is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.
   - The starting value minus 12 is \(20 - 12 = 8\).
   - So, the expression becomes \(6 \times 8 = 48\).

Therefore, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when Maggie sets it to 450 degrees. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature setting would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, accounting for the 4% error.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the set temperature. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

**Final Answer: 500**"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
   - So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating 30% of the price of Herb's house. Herb's house is worth $76,000.

First, calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

Next, subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought by Judy and her friend: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes brought by Judy and her friend: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

Adding the total cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 + 68 = 120\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(120\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many single use contacts Pete will get from 2 boxes. Since one box contains 90 single use contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Now, to find the cost per single use contact when buying 2 boxes, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per single use contact when buying 2 boxes is $1.00. However, the question asks for the cost per pair of contacts. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts, each box contains 45 pairs of contacts (because 90 divided by 2 is 45). Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities to get the total calories burned:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Now, we use the given ratio to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. We can set up the proportion as follows:
\[
\frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{160000 \, \text{ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = 800 \, \text{ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. We can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( B \):

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = 30\]

Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:
\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[\boxed{90}\]"
"First, let's convert all of Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equal to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equal to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equal to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in nickels, so that's \(14\) nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equal to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equal to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds Marissa makes in one hour:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Ruiz in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Chocolates made by Marissa in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together gives the total amount of chocolates made by both in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total chocolates made} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"

- **Tuesday**: He spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- **Wednesday**: He spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}\).
- Over four hours, his total earnings are \(4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00\).

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}\).
- Over two hours, his total earnings are \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00\).

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00.

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \(\boxed{42}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile for one tire:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per mile} = 725
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month for one tire:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per month} = 725 \times 400 = 290,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year for one tire:**

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"First, let's determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would provide half of that amount:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. So, the cost per washing is:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per washing:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 0.20 \text{ dollars} \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
2. Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts after the discount.
3. Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount of money.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.**

The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts after the discount.**

The price of the shorts is $35. Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount of money.**

Joe has $50 initially. After the purchase, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Joe does not have enough money to make the purchase. He is short by $2.50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 - 5 = 5\) months.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the initial month's cost.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\)
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\)

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck during the week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[
\boxed{54}
\]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed to grow} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profits:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profits.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright on the wave. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

So, Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob, and then use that to find the time it takes to close the initial 75-mile gap.

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 mph
   - Tom's speed: 70 mph
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the time to close the gap:**

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of classes} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10} = \$6
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum cost per class} = \$10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost if Manny misses \( x \) classes:**
   \[
   \text{Number of classes attended} = 10 - x
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 - x}
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality to ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10:**
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   \[
   10x \leq 40

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:

   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total sales in the first month:**
   - Total sales in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total sales in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the sales in the second month:**
   - Sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total sales over the two months:**

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial Cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Fuel Cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Maintenance Cost} = \text{Monthly Hanger Cost} + \text{Monthly Fuel Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
   \]

5. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \text{Initial Cost} + (\text{Total Monthly Maintenance Cost} \times 12)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \$150,000 + (\$15,000 \times 12)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for the First Year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took Finley 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Thus, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Since Kassidy has $90, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has 24 toys but only needs enough for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - The total number of toys James needs is the number of toys for 21 dogs, which is 21.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{21}\)."

Adding Jack's weight (80 kg) to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress can be written as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]

Next, we solve for \( T \):
\[ 2T = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = \frac{37}{2} \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we have the age of the triplet, we can find the age of the twin using the first equation:
\[ W = T + 7 \]
\[ W = 18.5 + 7 \]
\[ W = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together, we get:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for his nap, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies and lollipops Manolo initially bought.

The cost of the lollipops:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

The total cost of the candies and lollipops:
\[ \$2.00 + \$3.20 = \$5.20 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know the total cost of four candies is $3.20, so:
\[ \text{Cost of one candy} = \frac{\$3.20}{4} = \$0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$0.80 \text{ per candy} = \$8.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 10 years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so over 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins saved by both Rong and Neil gives us the total number of coins they have together after 10 years:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

The cost of the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let the total bill be \( T \), then:
\[ x = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + x \]

Substituting \( x = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of a banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and a banana costs twice as much as an apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of an orange. An orange costs three times as much as a banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost for the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost for the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost for the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
   - Therefore, the number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
   - Therefore, the number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.

4. **White Squares:**
   - The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.
   - Therefore, the number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, we sum up all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Thus, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of Adam's points and add it to Adam's points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}

"First, let's determine the capacity of each truck.

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity is:
   \[
   4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:
\[
4000 + 4800 + x = 11600
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[
8800 + x = 11600
\]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:
\[
x = 11600 - 8800
\]
\[
x = 2800
\]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each of them has left after two weeks.

- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:

\[58 - 44 = 14\]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 9x + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 9x = 90 \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is:

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ \text{Beck's apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, the number of apples each has changes. Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in one class, we calculate 40% of 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   - The total number of students in each class is 40.
   - The number of boys in each class is the total number of students minus the number of girls.

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

The daily savings per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars} \]

The total daily savings for 500 tomatoes is:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. We know that Sean has 56 marbles and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups:

\[ \text{Number of students per group for 12 groups} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, and we have 54 students, we can't form 12 groups of equal size with 54 students. However, the question asks how many more groups are needed to form if we consider the scenario of forming 12 groups.

To find out how many more groups are needed, we need to determine the total number of groups that can be formed with 54 students and then subtract the 6 groups that are already formed:

\[ \text{Total groups that can be formed} = \frac{54}{4.5} = 12 \]

Since 6 groups are already formed, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form 12 groups is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since each 4-week month consists of 4 weeks, two 4-week months consist of:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Arnold steals 24 bananas, leaving Gunther with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to the remaining 24 bananas.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- **Glasses**: 8 dozen glasses
  \[
  8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates**: 4 dozen plates
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- **Broken glasses**: 10 glasses
- **Broken plates**: 6 plates

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts:

- **Remaining glasses**:

  96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates**:
  \[
  48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

Finally, we add the remaining glasses and plates to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

\[
86 \text{ glasses} + 42 \text{ plates} = 128 \text{ items}

1. **Initial Stickers and Conversion Rates:**
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

6. **Summary of Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Of these remaining 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the total number of Pomeranian puppies be \( P \).
2. According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. Therefore, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3}P \).
3. We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}P = 6
   \]
4. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]
   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

5. The problem states that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let the total number of Jana's puppies be \( T \). Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}T \).
6. We know that the number of Pomeranian puppies is 18, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}T = 18

\[
\text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount he has from the cost of the camera:

\[
\text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance covered by driving and the distance covered by hiking, then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance covered by driving:
- The Llesis family drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
- Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance covered by driving is:
  \[
  \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ miles per hour} = 225 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the distance covered by hiking:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their average hiking speed was \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance covered by hiking is:
  \[
  \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ miles per hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

Finally, we sum the distances covered by driving and hiking to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities involved:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \ be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the relationships we have:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]
   So, the remaining two pizzas cost $34 in total.

4. **Cost per Remaining Pizza**: Since the remaining two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
   \[
   \frac{34}{2} = 17
   \]

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the total.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the 5 usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - There are 5 usual days.
   - Total rides on usual days = \(3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}\).

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days:**
   - On these days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) rides per day.
   - There are 2 special days.
   - Total rides on special days = \(6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Total rides in a week = rides on usual days + rides on special days.
   - Total rides in a week = \(15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}\).

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after buying the fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the difference in distance between the two cars:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 400 \times 0.8 = 320 \)

Next, we sum the number of students who passed across all grades:
\[ 340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680 \]

Now, we sum the total number of students who took the test:
\[ 500 \text{ (third-graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 1000 \]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:
\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 68\% \).

**Final Answer:**
\[ 68\% \]"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

   \]

4. **Determine the height of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.

5. **Calculate the length of the mosaic:**
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by the product of its length and height.
   \[
   \text{Area} = L \times \text{Height} = L \times 3
   \]
   - We know the area is 12 square inches.
   \[
   L \times 3 = 12
   \]
   - Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies but ended up selling 150. After selling these 150 candies, he ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we first calculate the total number of candies he now has:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (new order)} = 250 \text{ candies} \]

Since he initially only planned to sell 100 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
\[ 250 \text{ (total candies)} - 100 \text{ (initial plan)} = 150 \text{ candies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of petals in the vase.

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She picks another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
     \[

"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.

1. John makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
2. DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so he uses 9 marshmallows.
3. They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

The total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 9 + 9 + 3 = 21 \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After using and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

Now, we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can make with the remaining 14 marshmallows. Since they are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the playing time for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two of Jack's friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time in minutes:**
   - Jack plays for 4 hours, which is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses 24 quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know the following relationships:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

We can substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation for \( o \):
\[ o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z. \]

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10. \]
Substituting \( o = 4z \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4z + z + z + 2z + 2z = 10. \]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 10z = 10. \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 1. \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4. \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount of money spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day:**
   - Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.
   - On the second day, she walked half as many hours as on the first day.
   - Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total time walked over the two days in hours:**
   - Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
   - Total time = \( 8 \) hours + \( 4 \) hours = \( 12 \) hours

3. **Convert the total time from hours to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60.
   - Total time in minutes = \( 12 \) hours \(\times 60\) minutes/hour = \( 720 \) minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is **720 minutes**."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount, then find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production:**
   Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   \[
   \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Fourth Week Production:**
   The total monthly production is 50,000 bars. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount after the first three weeks.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\) bars."
"To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on each activity and then sum these times.

1. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance that the kangaroos crossed.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the farmer currently produces:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math (which includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English):

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such segments fit into the total concert time, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total concert time is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups to perform = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means the interest earned each year is $225. Now, we calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Finally, we add the total interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
2. Half of the white shirts have collars. Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
3. This means the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of floral shirts without buttons} - \text{Number of white shirts without collars} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"

"First, we need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. Given that there are 90 rooms in total:

\[
\text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, to find the total time required to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

\[
\text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( C \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
\[ C = B - 3 \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
\[ M = C - 2 \]

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
\[ \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \]

4. The sum of all their ages is 87:
\[ C + M + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

First, substitute \( C \) and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:

\[ (B - 3) + ((B - 3) - 2) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:

\[ B = 16 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the equation for \( C \):

\[ C = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old.

"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks. To confirm, 6 packs would only give him \(6 \times 8 = 48\) glue sticks, which is not enough. Therefore, he needs 7 packs to have at least 56 glue sticks, which is more than the 54 needed.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[
\boxed{14000}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. Therefore, the amount Julieta received is:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her son.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

**Final Answer: 3**"
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

- Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns:
  \[
  1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Therefore, in a year, Wendy earns:
  \[
  3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**
   - There are 50 students.
   - Each student was given 10 burritos.
   \[
   50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed:**
   - Add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.
   \[

   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of red cars is 12.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's denote the number of yellow cars as \(Y\).

The total number of cars in the rink is the sum of red, green, blue, and yellow cars, which is given as 75. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[52 + Y = 75\]

To find \(Y\), we subtract 52 from both sides of the equation:

\[Y = 75 - 52\]
\[Y = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we have \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the potatoes.
2. Calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes.
3. Determine the weight of the carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Step 1: The weight of the potatoes is given as 5 pounds.

Step 2: The weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, the weight of the carrots is:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is \(\boxed{7}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$500 \]"
"First, let's determine the total monthly cost of groceries, which is $400.

Madeline pays 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount Madeline pays per month is:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost:
\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

This $160 is the total amount Keenan pays per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide this amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):
\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = \(\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\).

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - 3 bottles of soda at $3.00 each = \(3 \times 3.00 = 9.00\).

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - 2 bottles of water at $2.00 each = \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\).

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost for David's purchase.

5. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = cost of soda + cost of water = \(9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00\).

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is \(\boxed{13.00}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second.
2. The speed of a whatchamacallit is given as 121 meters per second, and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   11v = 121
   \]
3. Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
4. The speed of a whirligig is five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:
   \[
   5v = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{55}

"Let's break down the costs and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the yogurt:**
   - The salad costs $6.
   - The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   - The total cost of the salad and yogurt is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the total cost of the carrots:**
   - Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily diet.
   - The cost of the salad and yogurt is $9.
   - Therefore, the cost of the carrots is \( 11 - 9 = 2 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of one carrot:**
   - Ellen eats 2 carrots a day.
   - The total cost of the carrots is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise. He used to make $10 per hour and received a raise of $2 per hour, so his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from mowing lawns and then subtract that from her total earnings to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.
- Then, the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn the second week is \( \frac{A}{5} \).

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each mowing, we can set up the following equations based on the payments:
1. For the first week: \( 6 \times 3J + 6 \times J = 18J + 6J = 24J \)
2. For the second week: \( 6 \times \frac{A}{5} = \frac{6A}{5} \)

The total earnings from mowing lawns is the sum of the earnings from both weeks:
\[ 24J + \frac{6A}{5} \]

We know Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns is $80. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 24J + \frac{6A}{5} = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine the values of \( J \) and \( A \). However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine \( J \) and \( A \) individually, but we can express \( L \) in terms of \( J \) and \( A \):
\[ L = 80 - 24J - \frac{6A}{5} \]

Since the problem does not give specific values for \( J \) and \( A \), we need to assume a scenario that fits the conditions. Let's assume \( J = 1 \) (the simplest case):
\[ 24J = 24 \times 1 = 24 \]
\[ \frac{6A}{5} = 6 \times \frac{A}{5} \]

If \( A = 5 \):
\[ \frac{6A}{5} = \frac{6 \times 5}{5} = 6 \]

Then:
\[ L = 80 - 24 - 6 = 50 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John rents his car out each month:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of times rented} \times \text{Hours per rental} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from renting the car:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the car payment from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Car payment} = 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

"First, let's calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[

"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls or
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This means the remaining soup will be used for the children.

The total capacity of the pot is 4 adult bowls, which is equivalent to 8 child bowls. After the adults have their bowls, the remaining soup is:
\[ 4 \text{ adult bowls} - 2 \text{ adult bowls} = 2 \text{ adult bowls} \]

Since 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (because 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls), the remaining soup can be divided among the two children.

Each child will get:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ child bowls per child} \]

Therefore, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

**Final Answer:**
Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."
"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50. Since William bought five notebooks, the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]

2. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. Since William bought one ballpen, the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]

3. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Duncan and Adam. Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age. According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:

\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):

\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We are given that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of bologna pieces thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

We know that \( R = 20 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cups and Rows:**
   - Lana has 27 cups of tea.
   - She divides these into 3 rows.

2. **Cups per Row:**
   - Each row will have \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.

3. **Equal Amounts of Chamomile and Mint Tea in Each Row:**
   - In each row, the 9 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea.
   - Therefore, in each row, there are \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea.

4. **Total Cinnamon Tea:**
   - The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.
   - The total number of cups used for cinnamon tea is 15.

5. **Verification:**
   - Total cups used for chamomile and mint tea in all rows: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \) cups.
   - Total cups used for cinnamon tea: 15 cups.
   - Total cups used: \( 27 + 15 = 42 \) cups, but since the total cups are 27, the cinnamon tea cups are already accounted for in the remaining after chamomile and mint.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( 4.5 \).

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \( \boxed{4.5} \)."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - In 8 hours, the number of trips the sloth can make is:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of berries collected per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries collected per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool initially has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**
   \[
   39
   \]

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Since she removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday each day:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Tuesday)}
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Wednesday)}
   \]

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**
   \[
   48
   \]

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**
   \[
   57
   \]

Next, we sum the Junebugs removed each day to find the total:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

The total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Now, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[

"First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the numbers of each type of toy:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can translate this information into equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( \boxed{50} \)."

"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the initial 12-hour stay cost:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Cameron would save:

   - James buys 10 CDs.
   - Each CD costs $15.
   - Total cost before discount = \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40%.
   - Discount amount = \( 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = \( 150 - 60 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount James gets from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sells 5 CDs for $40 each.
   - Total amount from selling 5 CDs = \( 5 \times 40 = 200 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out of pocket:**
   - Total cost after discount = $90.
   - Amount received from selling 5 CDs = $200.
   - Net amount out of pocket = \( 90 - 200 = -110 \) dollars.

Since the net amount is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a net loss. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that he was not out any money but gained $110.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum initially} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Number of copies sold: 10
   - Price per copy: $15
   - Commission per copy: \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \) dollars

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission from New York Times: $3
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: $12
   - Total commission: \( 3 + 12 = 15 \) dollars

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15**."
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the three players is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages are in 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Given that 100 pages are in 1 inch, this means each inch of the stack contains 100 pages.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - Since 1 inch contains 100 pages, 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, meaning each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages is:
     \[
     75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{150}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

2. **Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:**
   - \( \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled:**
   - Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval.
   - \( 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \).

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of **1800 reports**."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Calculate the duration: \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Kim woke up earlier:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. but woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep that day:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - Convert 7 hours and 55 minutes to minutes: \(7 \times 60 + 55 = 475\) minutes.

5. **Subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total sleep time:**
   - Total sleep time: 475 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Sleep time on the bed: \(475 - 23 = 452\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of occupied beds.
2. Determine the initial number of unoccupied beds.
3. Calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
4. Determine the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.
5. Calculate the new number of unoccupied beds.

Let's start with the initial number of occupied beds:
- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied beds initially is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.

Next, we calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds:
- The number of unoccupied beds initially is \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

Now, we calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks:
- There are 50 patients admitted each day.
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks is \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

Next, we determine the new number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:
- The new number of occupied beds is the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.
- Therefore, the new number of occupied beds is \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

Finally, we calculate the new number of unoccupied beds:
- The new number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the new number of occupied beds.
- Therefore, the new number of unoccupied beds is \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (non-work emails) are to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails, which are not to family, are to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly says that Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then we can set up the equation for Jason's balls:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls equation:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes

   Total holes dug by the end of the third day:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Account for the holes filled in on the third day:**
   - Holes filled in: 2 holes

   Total holes remaining after filling in:
   \[
   31 - 2 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of holes on the island by the end of the third day:**
   - The island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - Holes at the end of the first day: 10 holes

   Total holes on the island by the end of the third day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Holes on the island by the end of the third day: 40 holes
   - Holes remaining after the third day: 29 holes

   Holes dug on the fourth day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Therefore, the number of corn chips each of them got is 70.

Collins received 15 more corn chips than the others, so Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[
70 + 70 + 85 = 225
\]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"First, let's determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9, we find:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan using the expression \( S = 4A - 13 \):
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[

"To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

1. **Initial Batch:**
   Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Office Party:**
   She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Surprise Party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Received:**
   Adding all the brownies together:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (office party)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten:**

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani's age is given as 8 years.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, the sister's age is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years.

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

The price of the first two phones is $600 each. So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

Each phone after the first two is half price, so each of the remaining two phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the remaining two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes to find out how many boxes she has left:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes she kept. She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the boxes she had left to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so the additional amount needed is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of boxes sold for each type of product on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate the total earnings.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( G_S \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_S \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_U \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_U \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread, so \( G_S = 10 \).
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday, so \( A_S = A_U - 4 \).
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so \( G_U = G_S + 5 \).
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so \( A_U = 15 \).

Using the information above, we can find \( A_S \):
\[ A_S = A_U - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \]

Next, we find \( G_U \):
\[ G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for each day:
- On Saturday, the earnings from gingerbread are \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) dollars.
- On Saturday, the earnings from apple pie are \( 11 \times 15 = 165 \) dollars.
- On Sunday, the earnings from gingerbread are \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) dollars.
- On Sunday, the earnings from apple pie are \( 15 \times 15 = 225 \) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings for the two days:
\[ 60 + 165 + 90 + 225 = 540 \]

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use:**
   - Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
     \[
     32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount per bottle:
     \[
     \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's determine the price of the red car. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price and subtract it from the blue car's price.

The price of the blue car is $100. 

40% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, let's find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this number as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

The total number of students leaving early is the sum of the football players, cheerleaders, and band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is \( \frac{12}{12} = 1 \) foot.
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Total space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant is \( 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 \) feet.

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is \( \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ \text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week."
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for each type of plant and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total number of each type of plant needed:
- Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.

So, the total number of petunias needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias} \]

And the total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the petunias is:
\[ 15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00 \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find the total amount Katherine will spend:
\[ \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp, which is \( \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = 3 \) sets.
   - Since each set takes 10 minutes, sautéing 90 shrimp will take \( 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \).

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:

- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté
- Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. So, \( D = 30 \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then Bill was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency and count of each type of check he writes.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes \(12\) checks for the electric bill.

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Similarly, he writes \(12\) checks for the gas bill.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks to the church.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes \(4\) checks for the pest and lawn service.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers.
2. Determine how much money Adam's mother gave him.
3. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him.
4. Calculate the total amount of money given by his parents.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the total amount given by his parents, which is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can substitute the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we need to find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[\text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now we substitute \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices. The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."

2. Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines.**

The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of baby porcupines born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

**Step 3: Determine the total number of porcupines after a year.**

There are 12 months in a year. The total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the number of baby porcupines born in a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

The final cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Total number of sticks = \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Speed} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Speed} = 45 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. The difference is:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped, so Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water pumped on the first day: \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day, so she pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water pumped on the second day: \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   - Total water pumped: \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Determine the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   - The tank's total capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - The amount of water already pumped is 12000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the remaining capacity is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to determine the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank is at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge is \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   So, the charge percentage at the start of the last 3 hours is approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since Anne has 10 friends and she distributed the sweets equally among them, each friend received:

Therefore, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and portraits.

First, we find out how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[
\frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are for selfies only and 2 of the albums are for portraits only. Therefore, the total number of pictures that are selfies is:

\[
3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
\]

Similarly, the total number of pictures that are portraits is:

\[
2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
\]

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together, we get:

\[
27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
     Since these are equally divided:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - For easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore, the amount of ore mined per day with a steel pickaxe is \(24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to calculate how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.
2. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92 \]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 100\% - 92\% = 8\% \]

**Final Answer:**
8%"

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**
Each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans that correspond to the number of large jelly beans that fill him up.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium jelly beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to 150 medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     3 \times 150 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 9 bottles, he will need to make 8 trips (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth).
   - The total time is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese that Amor buys. The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:

\[ 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese that Amor buys. The price of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:

\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:

\[ 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she started with:

\[ 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total income he would have earned without going to college, and the total income he will earn with his college degree. Then, we can determine how long it will take for him to earn back the money he spent and lost.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total income lost from not working while in college:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - Total income lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn back:**
   - Total amount to earn back = Total amount borrowed + Total income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

4. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income is tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn back the $300,000:**
   - Time to earn back = Total amount to earn back / Annual income after college = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \text{ square feet} \]"

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   \[
   120 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Twice the number of people who descended (which is 50) board the train.
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Adding these 100 people to the current number of people on the train.
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 more people descend from the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110 \text{ people}

"First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident.

The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the increase as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per week:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week.
   - Total sheets per week = 4 (twin) + 1 (king) = 5 sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed per week:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.
   - Since 4 twin sheets are used per week, it will take 2 loads to wash all the twin sheets (2 sets per load).
   - 1 king sheet per week requires 1 load.
   - Total loads per week = 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads.

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit charge**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge for the visit is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking charge**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking, so:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: 32 classes visited.
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many classes as on Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. **Wednesday**: Three times as many classes as on Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. **Thursday**: 30 classes visited.
5. **Friday**: 25 classes visited.

Now, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Add the score of the 4th test:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Finally, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs from the initial order plus the additional meatballs.
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs} + 12 \text{ meatballs} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The effective cost per pound of butter is:
     \[
     \frac{6.00}{1.5} = 4.00 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   Since the effective cost per pound is $4.00, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
   \[
   6 \text{ pounds} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars per pound} = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}

"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is a fixed $125. Additionally, there is a charge of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the fixed rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie originally had. Since Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60, we can set up the following equation to find the original amount of money Maggie had:

\[ \text{Original amount of Maggie's money} - \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Original amount of Maggie's money} = 60 \]

Let \( M \) be the original amount of Maggie's money. Then we have:

\[ M - \frac{1}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ M = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, we need to determine how much money Riza originally had. Since Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60, we can set up the following equation to find the original amount of money Riza had:

\[ \text{Original amount of Riza's money} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Original amount of Riza's money} = 60 \]

Let \( R \) be the original amount of Riza's money. Then we have:

\[ R - \frac{1}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ R = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:

\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys each day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in one day:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week (7 days), the total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[ \frac{315}{7} = 45 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we can find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day:
\[ 45 - 24 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle and then finished another entire 500 piece puzzle.

So, Teddy finished 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

**Final Answer:**
750"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters. Since $1 is equivalent to 4 quarters, $5 is equivalent to:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with \(\boxed{20}\) quarters."

"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine how long Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after the first train leaves).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Leaves after 35 minutes (30 minutes after the first train leaves + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the first train leaves (65 minutes after the first train leaves).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (20 minutes after the third train leaves).
   - This is 85 minutes after the first train leaves (65 minutes + 20 minutes).

Paul will board the fourth train, which arrives 85 minutes after the first train leaves. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will have to wait 75 minutes (85 minutes - 10 minutes) for his train.

**Final Answer:**
Paul will wait for 75 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount amount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount amount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
\[
\boxed{72000}

"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( F \) represent Frankie's score and \( B \) represent Binkie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score \( B \) is 90. The problem also states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be written as:

\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:

\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Therefore, Frankie's score is \( 195 \)."
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. The distance from James's home to the store is 4 miles.
2. James walked halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. He then had to walk back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) miles.
5. James's walking speed is 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk 4 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total length of the fence:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we use this annual growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the earnings from all types of bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - The net change in the number of bales per hour is the difference between the hay produced and the hay picked up.
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced per hour - Hay picked up per hour
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales/hour - 3 bales/hour = 2 bales/hour

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - The total net change in the number of bales over 6 hours is the net change per hour multiplied by the number of hours.
   - Total net change = Net change per hour × Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour × 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ \text{Total minutes in classes per day} = 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total number of minutes spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ \text{Total minutes in classes per week} = 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days.

\[ \text{Extra learning time per week} = \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time on the weekend to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ \text{Total weekly learning time} = 1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ \text{Total weekly learning time in hours} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of each child step by step.

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Calculation: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Calculation: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Calculation: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

Thus, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\)."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step to determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours.

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Finally, we add the distances traveled by both trains to find the total distance between them after 3 hours.

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran \(\boxed{16}\) miles."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"First, let's break down the time each person took to complete their chores:

1. **Amalia's time**: Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. **Megan's time**: Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's. Therefore, Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours to walk the dog.
3. **Dior's time**: Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. The problem does not specify an exact number, but it states ""well over 4 hours longer,"" so we can assume the minimum time Dior took is just over 8 hours. For the sake of calculation, we can use 9 hours as a reasonable minimum (since ""well over"" suggests a time significantly more than 8 hours, but we need a specific number for the calculation).

Now, we sum up the times:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores is:
\[ 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is **560 miles**."
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, in 7 days she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

**Final Answer:**
\[ 35 \text{ miles} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - The first 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first 4 workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers:**
   - The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total number of toys produced by all 5 workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers. The remaining stickers Luis gave to Kris, which is also \( \frac{S}{4} \).
3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the number of stickers Kris received from Luis is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \).

Since Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{S}{4} = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:
\[ S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

So, Seth originally had \( 64 \) stickers.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate half of the circumference of the earth:**
   The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it takes for him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

**Vince is now 9 years old.**"
"Let's define the variables for the number of eggs each person painted:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The combined weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = \( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{96}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, given the different speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The distance she covers on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \), we can find her speed on the beach:
\[ 2 = v \times 40 \]
\[ v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):
\[ \text{time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we can find the total time for the entire 3-mile walk by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of marbles Bob has:**
   - Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and then has 60 marbles.
   - 2 dozen marbles is equal to \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.
   - Therefore, if Bob initially had \(x\) marbles, after receiving 24 more, he has \(x + 24 = 60\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 60 - 24 = 36\).
   - So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles:**
   - If Bob loses 10 marbles from his initial 36, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob will have is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the water in the bottle is \( 4 \times 33 + 1 \times T = 132 + T \) degrees.

The average temperature of the water in the bottle is given by:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]
\[
T \geq 200 - 132
\]
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = \$40.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Each pack contains 9 bagels, and he orders 4 packs, so the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:
\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]
So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make the mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's break this down further:
- 3 less than 6 potatoes is:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]
- 1 less than 3 scoops is:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]
So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide 3 potatoes by 2 scoops:
\[ \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \]
Therefore, it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. Since Gomer ate 18 scoops, we multiply 18 scoops by 1.5 potatoes per scoop:
\[ 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \]
So, the number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of passengers:

\[ \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 84 \]

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). Therefore, we have:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Next, we need to account for the 20 women who alight from the bus at the next stop. The number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the individual sunflowers and the bouquets.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The cost of one sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:

"To find the average speed, we need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Initial time: 2 hours
- Additional time: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of winning with the second lottery ticket and then find the probability that both tickets are winners.

1. **Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\) or 60%.

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning each ticket.
   - This is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - \(0.12\) as a percentage is \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sells 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is **$170**."

   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. Therefore, Stacy finds:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. Therefore, Charlie finds:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. Therefore, Mei finds:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total number of eggs found by all the children:
\[
5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, let's determine the number of fruits produced by the 8-year-old tree. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Next, we sum up the fruits produced by the tree each year from age 5 to 10:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these values together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
   \]
   \[
   15 - x = 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 15 - 12
   \]
   \[
   x = 3

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the amount of red paint used as \( R \) pints, the amount of white paint as \( W \) pints, the amount of purple paint as \( P \) pints, and the amount of yellow paint as \( Y \) pints.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, so \( R = W = P \).
2. Half the mural is yellow, so \( Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.
3. The total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Since \( R = W = P \), we can express the total amount of paint as:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) and \( Y \) with 6, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ \text{Number of pods in the special size box} = 100 + (0.20 \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

Therefore, you can run \(\boxed{10}\) dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."

   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(16\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using 20% of the chalk each day before it becomes too small to use.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: 5 inches
2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: 45% of 5 inches
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Chalk Remaining After Monday**: 
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Daily Usage**: 20% of the remaining chalk
5. **Chalk Remaining After Each Day**: We need to calculate the remaining chalk after each day until it falls below 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- **Day 1 (Tuesday)**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}

"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
3. Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. There are 12 girls in total, and one-third of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. There are 12 boys in total, and one-fourth of them are on varsity:
\[
\text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
\text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students to find the number of students not on varsity. The total number of students is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]
So, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[
24 - 7 = 17
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]
Simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Distribute the 3 and the 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Given that 100 books cost $500, we can find the cost per book by dividing $500 by 100:
     \[
     \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book}
     \]
   - Now, we can find the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by the cost per book:
     \[
     \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Since Bob distributes the money equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
     \[
     \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books}
     \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Let's break down the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he put 4 apples in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree, so he brought home 1 apple from the 5 that fell.
- After the second action, he picked up 4 more apples.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 \text{ (from the first action)} + 4 \text{ (from the second action)} = 5 \]

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total miles run on each day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 3 miles:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- This totals to \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\).

Next, let's calculate the miles run on the days Sam ran 5 miles:
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
- This totals to \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\).

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days to get the total miles run in the week:
\[9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

   - Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour.

2. **Rate of melting snowballs:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - There are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, so in one hour, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs melt.

3. **Net rate of snowball production:**
   - Net rate = Rate of building - Rate of melting
   - Net rate = \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs per hour.

4. **Determine the time needed to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find the time \(t\) such that the net production of snowballs equals 60.
   - Using the net rate, we set up the equation: \(12t = 60\).

5. **Solve for \(t\):**
   \[
   t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

**Final Answer:**
Jim is 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:

1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(38 + 50 - 38 = 50\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 + 50 - 28 = 72\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages used: \(\frac{50}{2} = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(72 + 100 - 25 = 147\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial count to match this condition.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \((x + 12) + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \((x + 34) + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109 = -31\]

Since the initial number of bandages cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem setup. The correct interpretation should be that the initial number of bandages plus the net addition over the three days equals 78. Let's recheck the net addition:

- Net addition over three days: \(50 - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 109 - 91 = 18\)

So, the initial number of bandages \(x\) should satisfy:
\[x + 18 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 18 = 60\]

Thus, the nurses started with \(\boxed{60}\) bandages on the first day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost per inch of haircut is $30, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means 2 inches were cut off.

The cost for the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

The total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine how much money Jason earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each task he performed over the two-week period and then sum them up.

1. **Emptying the dishwasher**: Jason earns $0.50 for each time he empties the dishwasher. He did this 6 times.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Doing his laundry**: Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

3. **Cleaning his room**: Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Taking the trash to the curb**: Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week. He did this twice.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To find the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of blood in one shark.
2. Multiply that amount by the number of sharks.

First, we know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:
\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total:
\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of red pens.
2. Calculate the number of black pens.
3. Add the number of red pens and black pens together.

First, we know that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we know that the number of black pens is twice the number of red pens. Therefore, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, we add the number of red pens and black pens together to find the total number of pens:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Thus, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[
\text{Total cost for cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Second Day:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Adding these together, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( 8 \).

**Final Answer:**
8"

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Floor to ceiling height on the first floor = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

Since the house is two-story, we need to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. The total height of the house is the sum of the first floor's height and the second floor's height. The first floor's height is 180 inches, so the second floor's height is the total height minus the first floor's height.

However, the second floor's height is not given directly, but we can find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof by subtracting the first floor's height from the total height of the house.

Height from the second floor's floor to the roof = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches.

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"First, let's determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells after Alphas:

\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's denote the miles the last dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the sum of the miles each dog needs to walk:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

We know that the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles. The formula for the average is the total miles divided by the number of dogs. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

To find \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to clear the denominator:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the loan amount:**
   - The house is worth $250,000.
   - John gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value.
   - Loan amount = 40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.

2. **Determine the amount used to pay off debts:**
   - John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
   - Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. **Determine the leftover amount:**
   - The leftover amount is the loan amount minus the amount used to pay off debts.
   - Leftover amount = $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is $40,000."

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."

   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

   - Therefore, the number of diapers changed by Jordan's wife is:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ diapers/day}}{2} = 5 \text{ diapers/day}
     \]

3. **Diapers Changed by Jordan:**
   - Since the total number of diaper changes per day is 10 and Jordan's wife changes 5 of them, the number of diapers Jordan changes is:
     \[
     10 \text{ diapers/day} - 5 \text{ diapers/day} = 5 \text{ diapers/day}

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of \( \boxed{100} \) dollars."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to answer:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions she has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test. She needs a total of 77 correct answers and has already answered 42 correctly, so she needs:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by the expression:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the expression for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"Let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

\[
5 \text{ (first side)} + 10 \text{ (second side)} + 10 \text{ (third side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fourth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (fifth side)} + 2.5 \text{ (sixth side)}
\]

Adding these times together:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at this net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, we calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed per table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on this information:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
