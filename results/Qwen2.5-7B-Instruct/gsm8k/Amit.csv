"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning and afternoon, Wendi gives 15 cups and 25 cups of feed, respectively. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- Cost of the first glass = $5
- Cost of the second glass = $3

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 120%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
   - Distance covered in 0.5 hours = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
   - Total time spent driving = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
   - Distance covered in the remaining 1.5 hours = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in 0.5 hours at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered in 1.5 hours at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate her earnings:

- Earnings from regular hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Earnings from overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
366"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners, and we know this is equal to 5.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

So, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as they will be worth $8,096 at the end of the month.

**Final profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96**

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

So, her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**

   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time Marissa has to cover the remaining distance:**

   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to cover:**

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**

   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - The remaining orange drink is 9 liters.
   - The remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total cost is the sum of all these items, which equals $50. So we can write the equation:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides:

\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Divide both sides by 8.50:

\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair of heels costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their current ages is 162. So we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, to find the average of these guesses, we add them together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is:
70"
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Aaron has 5 more jewels than this amount, so:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Final numerical answer:
23"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes
Total points = 4 points + 5 points
Total points = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets.
   - John has 13 lego sets.
   - He sells each lego set for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = 13 * $15 = $195.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the video games.
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total cost of video games = 8 * $20 = $160.

3. Now, calculate how much money John has left after buying the video games.
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - This means the money left after buying the video games is the total money from selling the lego sets minus the cost of the video games.
   - $195 - $160 = $35.

4. Since the problem states that John has $5 left, and we calculated that he should have $35 left, it implies that he did not sell all his lego sets. Let's find out how many lego sets he actually sold to end up with $5 left.

5. Let's assume he sold \( x \) lego sets.
   - Money from selling \( x \) lego sets = \( 15x \).
   - Cost of 8 video games = $160.
   - Money left = $5.
   - So, \( 15x - 160 = 5 \).

6. Solve for \( x \):
   - \( 15x = 165 \).
   - \( x = 11 \).

So, John sold 11 lego sets. Since he originally had 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:
- \( 13 - 11 = 2 \).

Final numerical answer:
2"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. So, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. If her skipping speed is half her running speed, then her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time distribution: one-third of the time is spent running and two-thirds of the time is spent walking. In six hours, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled by running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly could stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g (approximately).

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work (220) from the total number of Post-it notes she had after purchasing the package.
4. The remaining Post-it notes should be equal to 23.

The equation representing this situation is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is 163.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy obtained from a 4-foot long wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. The time it takes to travel back can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys."

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the standard $50,000 annually. After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of $50,000, which is:

\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, her annual pension will be the base amount plus the additional 5%, which is:

\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Since Marcy quits after 30 years, she will receive the increased pension amount for the remaining 10 years. Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years of service will be:

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year:
- 10% of $140 is \(0.10 \times 140 = 14\).
- So, the charge for the second half of the year is \(140 - 14 = 126\) per month.

Now, let's calculate the total for each half of the year:
- For the first half of the year: \(6 \times 140 = 840\).
- For the second half of the year: \(6 \times 126 = 756\).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total for the year:
- Total amount paid = \(840 + 756 = 1596\).

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the mpg, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank:

\[ \text{Distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, to find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Final numerical answer:
36"
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching those students.

First, let's find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the money raised from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 \text{ per brownie} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the money raised from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of \$221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount.
4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The total cost of the cell phones before interest:
   \[
   5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750
   \]

2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = \$750 \times 2\% = \$750 \times 0.02 = \$15
   \]

3. Add the total interest to the total cost to get the final amount:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765
   \]

4. Divide the final amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days and then determine how many 110-cup bags are needed.

First, we know that for the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed in the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food consumed in the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed in the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the amounts of dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 550 cups of dog food. We do this by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:

- Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we have:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The team won 8 more games than they lost, so we have:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang = \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years:

1. **After 1 year (6th year of service):**
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 600 + (0.10 \times 600) = 600 + 60 = 660
   \]

2. **After 2 years (7th year of service):**
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 660 + (0.10 \times 660) = 660 + 66 = 726
   \]

3. **After 3 years (8th year of service):**
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 726 + (0.10 \times 726) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6
   \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of the attendees don't show up. So, the number of guests who will show up is:

\[ 16 - \left(\frac{1}{4} \times 16\right) = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad that the adults will eat.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. Since a child will eat half as much as an adult, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 20 adults will eat:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 5 children will eat:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts of potato salad for the adults and the children to find the total amount needed:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's denote the time Gerald used to take to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Final answer:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. Since each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be expressed as the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit, which is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

This total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( 5 \).

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages to be read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, and he also has a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days (Monday through Friday).

So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water.

On the weekends, he still has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days (Saturday and Sunday).

So, for the weekends, he drinks:
3 glasses/day * 2 days = 6 glasses of water.

Adding the weekday and weekend water consumption together:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 6 glasses (weekends) = 26 glasses of water in a week.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box and then calculate its inner volume. After that, we can multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. 

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups each person ate, we need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person and then find the average.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, to find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups each ate and divide by 2 (since there are two people):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Now, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the rate at which water enters the boat, which is 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water enters the boat over 80 feet, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. **2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Cost per board: $10
   - Number of boards: 10
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars

2. **4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Cost per board: $16
   - Number of boards: 5
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) dollars

Total cost of all the lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \] dollars

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells them at the same price she bought them for, which is $10 each.
   - Number of boards: 10
   - Total revenue for 2 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) dollars

2. **4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells them at the same price she bought them for, which is $16 each.
   - Number of boards: 5
   - Total revenue for 4 x 4 x 10 boards: \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) dollars

Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
\[ 100 + 80 = 180 \] dollars

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 180 - 180 = 0 \] dollars

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of:

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles on the first day was:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92

2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \)

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( B = 2Q \)
- \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \)

Now, substituting \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have \( Q \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, so its cost is $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so its cost is $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so its cost is $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so its cost is $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:

Total cost of non-food items = $3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:

Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1.

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the non-food items to get the final cost of the non-food items:

Final cost of non-food items = $10 + $1 = $11.

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the final cost of the non-food items:

Total cost = Cost of food items + Final cost of non-food items
Total cost = $2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) + $11 (non-food items) = $16.

So, the final numerical answer is:

$16."
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the bleach and cloths:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, and each bottle costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of bleach per client is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Each client also needs 1 pack of cloths, and each pack costs $5.
- Therefore, the cost of cloths per client is $5.

So, the total cost per client is \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we can calculate the total expenses for all 8 clients:

- Total expenses = \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

- Profit = Total income - Total expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year.

Step 1: Total pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (12 months), he can harvest:
  12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests.

Step 3: Total pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per hectare per year = 100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples/hectare.
- Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
  400 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. Let's break down the number of pieces in each set:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which means it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees from the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Final numerical answer:
75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, let's break down the charges:

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. On the first day, 5 people came by to get both tires inflated. So, the charge for the bicycles is:
   \[5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} \times \$0.25 \text{ per tire} = 10 \times \$0.25 = \$2.50\]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. On the first day, 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. So, the charge for the tricycles is:
   \[3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} \times \$0.25 \text{ per tire} = 9 \times \$0.25 = \$2.25\]

3. **Unicycle**: A unicycle has 1 tire. On the first day, 1 person came by on a unicycle. So, the charge for the unicycle is:
   \[1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} \times \$0.25 \text{ per tire} = 1 \times \$0.25 = \$0.25\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
x - 30 = 18
\]

Add 30 to both sides:

\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

\[
\boxed{48}

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum up the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/run} \times 15 \text{ runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards for one trip. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/trip} \times 34 \text{ trips} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly)."

- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each:

- Anakin's total: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Locsin's total: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, the price after every two months can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the rate of increase is 20% per period (2 months).

The formula for the future value (FV) after n periods, given an initial value (PV) and a rate of increase (r) per period, is:

\[ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \]

In this case:
- \( PV = 20 \) (the original price)
- \( r = 0.20 \) (20% increase)
- \( n = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) (since the price increases every two months, and 36 months is 18 periods of two months)

Plugging in the values:

\[ FV = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ FV = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the future value is:

\[ FV = 20 \times 39.366 \]
\[ FV \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately $787.32."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
5 red cars * $4 per red car = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the action figures:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
3 action figures * $5 per action figure = $15

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
Total cost = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is $50."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

Final answer: Seth is 16 years old."

"To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Chinese participants.
2. Subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that out of these 160 Chinese participants, 60 are boys. So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to find the number of white carnations first, and then use that to find the number of red roses.

Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

According to the problem, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. So we can write:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So the number of red roses \( R \) is:
\[ R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
3. Jan is 30 years old.

First, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago. Since Jan is currently 30, two years ago Jan was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago would be 14. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than 14, which means Mark was 19 two years ago.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:
\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we add 2 years to Mark's current age to find Jean's age:
\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

Jean is 23."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

**First Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Second Team:**
The second team's runners have different times for each leg of the race. The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for the four runners are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the two teams is:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \text{ seconds} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, which means Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

So, they both picked a total of 30 apples."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, let's calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters:
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- So, the total straw for hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Now, we know that the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces. So, the straw used for the rabbits is:
- \(160 - 50 = 110\) pieces of straw for the rabbits.

Since the problem states that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits, this part of the information seems to be a red herring or a misdirection, as it doesn't affect the calculation for the rats and hamsters.

Now, let's focus on the rats:
- The total straw for the rats is 160 - 50 = 110 pieces.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 3 cages of rats.

Let \(r\) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total number of rats is \(3r\), and the total straw for the rats is \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).

We know that \(18r = 110\). Solving for \(r\):
\[ r = \frac{110}{18} = \frac{55}{9} \approx 6.11 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the problem implies an equal distribution, we need to recheck the initial conditions or the interpretation. However, based on the given data and the requirement for an integer solution, the problem might have an inherent assumption or a need for rounding, but typically, the problem would be set up to have a whole number solution.

Given the problem's setup, the most logical and mathematically consistent answer, considering the need for an integer, is that the number of rats per cage is 5, as it's the closest whole number that fits the distribution pattern without fractional rats.

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag for the trader is the purchase price plus the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The selling price per bag is \( 30 \) dollars.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars per bag.

The total profit is given as \( 400 \) dollars. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as the profit per bag multiplied by the number of bags, which gives us the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \( 50 \) bags.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Friday Morning:** Sue's front yard has 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. **Saturday Morning:** The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. They then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \), and the number of white flamingos is 6.
3. **Sunday Morning:** The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \), and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos is 30 and the number of white flamingos is 6. The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score.

Let's denote the score Brinley needs on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the scores of the four highest tests is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score, the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) is:
\[ 367 + x \]

To get an average of 93 over the six tests, the sum of the five highest scores plus the sixth test score divided by 5 should equal 93:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 367 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
\[ 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

   - Let the cost of one dozen cups be \( C \).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 20C \).

3. **Relationship between the cost of cups and plates:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, we can write the equation: \( 20C = 6000 - 1200 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation: \( 20C = 4800 \).
   - Divide both sides by 20: \( C = \frac{4800}{20} \).
   - Therefore, \( C = 240 \).

5. **Total cost of buying each cup:**
   - Since \( C \) is the cost of one dozen cups, the cost of one cup is \( \frac{C}{12} \).
   - So, the cost of one cup is \( \frac{240}{12} = 20 \).

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes: 2 pairs at $20 each, so $20 * 2 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:**
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so $5 * 4 = $20

3. **Calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:**
   - Let's say she mows the lawn \( x \) times, earning $4 each time, so $4 * x = 4x

4. **Calculate how much money Sara has before she starts mowing the lawn:**
   - She already has $10 saved.

5. **Set up the equation to find out how much money Sara needs to earn from mowing the lawn:**
   - Total money Sara has = Money saved + Money from babysitting + Money from mowing the lawn
   - $70 = $10 + $20 + 4x
   - Simplify the equation: $70 = $30 + 4x
   - Subtract $30 from both sides: $40 = 4x
   - Divide both sides by 4: \( x = 10 \)

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

**Final Answer:**
10"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount she will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount promised to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

Finally, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points of the other three students from the overall total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes Andrew 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will take half as many days as the bus trip, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

So, the total travel time for the round trip will be the sum of the bus trip and the car trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:

Probability = 32 / 96

To find the percentage, we multiply the probability by 100:

Percentage = (32 / 96) * 100

Now, let's calculate the exact percentage:

Percentage = (32 / 96) * 100 = 0.3333 * 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%."
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito and then determine how much he still owes after using his gift card, let's break down the costs:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 (base) + $2.00 (meat) + $1.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (sauces) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00

Therefore, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which means her mom can place \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it will take them to complete the puzzle is:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21

"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects:

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

Final answer: 12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens. By mixing the ink from these 25 empty pens, he can make 5 full pens (since 25 empty pens can be mixed to make 5 full pens).

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 full pens from the first cycle and 20 empty pens left from the initial 25 pens. He can mix the ink from these 20 empty pens with the 5 full pens to make 4 more full pens (since 20 empty pens can be mixed to make 4 full pens, and he already has 5 full pens, making a total of 9 full pens).

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 9 full pens and 1 empty pen left. He can mix the ink from this 1 empty pen with 4 of the 9 full pens to make 1 more full pen (since 1 empty pen can be mixed to make 1 full pen, and he already has 9 full pens, making a total of 10 full pens).

5. **Fourth Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 10 full pens and 0 empty pens. He cannot make any more full pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, and he has no empty pens left.

So, after all the cycles, Ram will have a total of 30 pens (25 initial pens + 5 from the first cycle + 4 from the second cycle + 1 from the third cycle).

The final numerical answer is:

30"

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of candies Robert has be \( R \).
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) candies.
3. We are given that John has 54 candies, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
4. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which also totals 3 books.

So, the total number of books read by both of them collectively is:

3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends 10 pages a week (2 letters * 5 pages).
3. Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, the total number of pages he receives in a week is 30 pages (3 pen pals * 10 pages each).
4. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week in response.
5. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is 60 pages (30 pages received + 30 pages written).
6. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing a week is 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes.
7. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 360 minutes / 60 = 6 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 6 hours writing a week."
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

The problem states that this difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums combined. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid to the makeup artist, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's work.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's work.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She works for 6 hours each day.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of **$27,000**."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags:

- Cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of onions is:

4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds

The cost of onions is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) girls in total.

Now, let's look at the girls in each class:
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is \(15 + 12 = 27\).

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is \(30 - 27 = 3\).

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is \(20 - 3 = 17\).

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It's also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. So, we calculate 30% of 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel, so:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas buys more. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the new cows to the original number of cows in each stall:

\[ 20 \text{ original cows/stall} + 2 \text{ new cows/stall} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

First, we can determine how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Substituting the number of apples Andrea has:

\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]

Solving for Jamal's apples:

\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has:

\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can find the number of bananas Andrea has:

\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea's apples: 52
- Andrea's bananas: 24
- Jamal's apples: 44
- Jamal's bananas: 48

Total number of fruits:

\[ 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm the oil.
   - Time to warm the oil is 28 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Finally, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total number of spots:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
- The number of sterling silver beads is the total length occupied by the beads divided by the length of each bead, which is \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:

"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

"To find the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the rows that are not 5-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars. So, the total number of stars in these rows is:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. So, the number of stars that are in the 5-star rows is:

\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Since each row of 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars

There are 8 children, so we divide the remaining bars equally among them:

16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars/child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."

"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points for all three players combined are:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner. So, the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. Now, we know the household consumes 2 kg of rice per day.

3. To find out how much rice is consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. Finally, to determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these up:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

Let's calculate the bids:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add up all the bids Carmen makes:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

So, the desk costs Carmen $900."

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then to lose 8 pounds, we can use the proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ weeks}}{2 \text{ pounds}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 6D + D = 210 \]

Combining like terms again, we get:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments:

- \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

14 people show up for Martha's party."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of poles:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of wires:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

At the beginning, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left."
"The book costs $4, and the magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = \$2 \]

A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = \$1 \]

The pen costs $1."
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. Meg has 46 pencils.

So, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that 3 boxes are enough to store 24 pencils (26 total pencils minus 2 loose pencils), we can assume that each box can hold 8 pencils (24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box).

To find out how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9 boxes"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records given up} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly pay is:

\[ \text{Monthly pay for senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 224000 \]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We are given that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert 120 minutes into hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops and her mother gives her another 10, so she has:

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is:
\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \]

This means they earned $4 off their next purchase.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since the reward is $4, the coupon took:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total discount from the reward and the coupon is:
\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \]

Subtracting this total discount from the amount spent:
\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"First, we calculate the number of ruined castles:

40% of 220 castles are ruins, so:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (assuming ""RJ"" is a typo and should be ""Richard"") has 5 guns, and Jason has 1 gun. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break it down as follows:

- For 8 batches of suckers: \(8 \times 30\) ounces
- For 1 batch of fudge: \(1 \times 70\) ounces

Now, let's do the math:

- \(8 \times 30 = 240\) ounces for the suckers
- \(1 \times 70 = 70\) ounces for the fudge

Adding these together:

- \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces

So, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

310 ounces"
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%.

The initial cost per share is $8. A 50% increase means the new price per share is:
\[ 8 + (0.50 \times 8) = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

So, after the first year, each share is worth $12. Since Maria bought 8 shares, the total value of her shares at the end of the first year is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

Next, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. A 25% decrease means the new price per share is:
\[ 12 - (0.25 \times 12) = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

So, after the second year, each share is worth $9. The total value of her shares at the end of the second year is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ 72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times C) + (2 \times H) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

The animals have a total of 160 legs."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 - 3 = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he regains 2 balls:

4 + 2 = 6 balls

Unfortunately, 1 ball is lost completely, so the final number of balls he has to juggle with is:

6 - 1 = 5 balls

Josh starts to juggle on stage with 5 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original 5000 meters.

First, calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, add this to the original distance:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson will run 6000 meters every day if he follows his coach's advice.

Since June typically has 30 days, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson would cover in June if he runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days.

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100
   - Percentage increase = ($100 / $1000) * 100 = 10%

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time of the vacation as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Since the cost for one friend is also $30, we can find out how many friends can be invited by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend:
- Number of friends = $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each. 

The cost of 4 lollipops is:
4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

So, each day she saves:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is:
$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = 40 * $0.05 = $2.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Change before buying gumballs = $10 - $2 = $8.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying the candy:**
   - Billy took half of his change to buy gumballs.
   - Therefore, the amount he had before buying the candy = $8 * 2 = $16.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - Total money Billy had initially = $10.
   - Money spent on candy = $16 - $10 = $6.

5. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of stuffing for a collie bed:**
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as \((8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5\) pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. We know the total number of people kicked out is 50. So, we can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Then:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   31 + x = 50
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 50 - 31 = 19
   \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames = $1056
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

20% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan would save $80 by making his own wallpaper.

To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned because they didn't fit, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Therefore, she fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 40 pupils in the class.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) pupils like blue.
3. The remaining pupils are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. The rest like yellow, so the number of pupils who like yellow is \( 20 - 5 = 15 \).

Therefore, 15 pupils like the color yellow."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56, at $4 per piece.
2. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
3. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.

First, we calculate the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday:
- Since she sold all the apples for $56 and each apple is sold for $4, the number of apples sold on Monday is \( \frac{56}{4} = 14 \) apples.

Next, we know the number of apples picked on Tuesday:
- Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

Then, we calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday:
- Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) apples on Wednesday.

Now, we sum up the apples picked over the three days:
- Monday: 14 apples
- Tuesday: 12 apples
- Wednesday: 24 apples

Total apples picked over the three days:

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest over the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate would be \(\frac{10\%}{12} \times 5 = \frac{10}{120} \times 5 = \frac{50}{120} = \frac{5}{12}\) or approximately 4.17%.

The total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + (\text{Principal} \times \text{Interest Rate}) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times \frac{5}{120}) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + (3650 \times 0.041667) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.0835 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} \approx 3802.08 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} \approx 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay approximately $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances they hiked:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. So, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups, the time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

So, David saves $6."

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can set up the following equation:

Initial amount + (Daily earnings * Number of days) = Cost of the bike

Let's denote the number of days Mark needs to save as \( d \).

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 50 + 10d = 300 \]

To find \( d \), we first subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 10d = 250 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 10:
\[ d = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, then Beth, who is 5 years younger than Erica, is:

30 - 5 = 25 years old.

Alice, who is 7 years older than Beth, is:

25 + 7 = 32 years old.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:

32 - 30 = 2 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 2 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total amount of milk he drinks is:

2 glasses * 8 ounces/glass = 16 ounces

If milk has 3 calories per ounce, then the total calories he consumed are:

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of weeks the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
3. Calculate the monthly earnings.
4. Multiply the monthly earnings by the number of months in a year to get the annual earnings.

Step 1: The builder works for 4 weeks every month.

Step 2: The builder works for 6 days every week. Therefore, in a month, the builder works:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Step 3: The builder gets paid $50 every day. Therefore, the monthly earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$1200/\text{month} \]

Step 4: There are 12 months in a year, so the annual earnings are:
\[ \$1200/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$14400/\text{year} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$14400 \]"
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Total number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

Finally, we calculate the average number of stripes:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, he needs to make:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:

- 5 pounds of meat
- 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together, Tyson will spend:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$50.00 \]"
"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he already had. So, the new number of cannolis and corns are:

New number of cannolis = 40 (original) + 60 (bought)
New number of cannolis = 100

New number of corns = 80 (original) - 40 (fewer)
New number of corns = 40

Now, to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

Combined total = New number of cannolis + New number of corns
Combined total = 100 + 40
Combined total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After these activities, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he had already taken and then subtract that from the total 10,000 steps.

Steps taken before the jog:
- 5,000 steps (to and from school)
- 1,000 steps (short walk with his friend)

Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Since he had 2,000 steps left after the jog, the steps taken during the jog would be:
10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before the jog) - 2,000 (steps left after the jog) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport:

60 minutes - 30 minutes (reading) - 10 minutes (travel) = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

**Final Answer:**
$42,000"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$3.00"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the amount of the first pack, which is $400. So, the second pack costs:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we add the cost of the first and second packs to find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price of the fireworks:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night and wants enough cookies to last her for 30 days. 

First, calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

First, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are considered ""more dangerous"" and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since the problem does not specify a percentage of candles that are ""more dangerous,"" we can assume that the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the ""more dangerous"" candles. 

Let's assume that the 5% that smell like wet dog are the only ones that are ""more dangerous"" (since the problem does not provide a different percentage for ""more dangerous"" candles). 

So, 5% of 50,000 candles smell like wet dog:
\[ 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Since the problem does not provide any information about the percentage of candles that explode, and we are only asked about the candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can only conclude that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is at most 2500, assuming all 2500 candles that smell like wet dog are the ones that could potentially explode.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2500} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of one discounted blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses. So, the total cost for 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

Joanne's total apples: \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples: \(60 + 45 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( \boxed{56} \)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, so:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."

So, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so that's a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( S_{tattered} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans and \( S_{jogger} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. We know:

\[ S_{tattered} + S_{jogger} = 6 \]
\[ S_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{tattered} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{tattered} \) be the original price of the tattered jeans. The sale price is $28, and the savings is $4, so:

\[ P_{tattered} - 28 = 4 \]
\[ P_{tattered} = 32 \]

Similarly, the savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( P_{jogger} \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price is $22, and the savings is $2, so:

\[ P_{jogger} - 22 = 2 \]
\[ P_{jogger} = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ P_{jogger} - P_{tattered} = 24 - 32 = -8 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute value of the difference is:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. The 4 buses can each hold 60 employees, so the total capacity for the buses is:

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \[10 \times 15 = 150\]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[240 + 180 + 150 = 570\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so the feeders she made attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."

3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket, he has $50 in spending cash, so the money he has after buying the ticket is \( x - 100 \) dollars.
- This remaining money is equal to $50, so we can set up the equation: \( x - 100 = 50 \).

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x - 100 = 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. This means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog.

2. The number of hot dogs prepared would be:
   - 18 guests * 2 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs
   - 18 guests * 1 hot dog = 18 hot dogs
   - Total hot dogs prepared = 36 + 18 = 54 hot dogs

3. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means:
   - 20 guests would need 2 hot dogs (10 guests needing 2 hot dogs each)
   - 20 guests would need 1 hot dog (10 guests needing 1 hot dog each)

4. The total number of hot dogs needed would be:
   - 20 guests * 2 hot dogs = 40 hot dogs
   - 20 guests * 1 hot dog = 20 hot dogs
   - Total hot dogs needed = 40 + 20 = 60 hot dogs

5. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hot dogs, the number of hot dogs short is:
   - 60 hot dogs needed - 54 hot dogs prepared = 6 hot dogs short

6. Since each of the 40 guests wanted a second hot dog, and only 6 hot dogs were short, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog would be:
   - 6 hot dogs short / 2 hot dogs per guest = 3 guests

Therefore, 3 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, and he spent 99% of his money, we can calculate the remaining 1% of $5:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount spent is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 0.05 \text{ dollars} = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

We already know that $1.20 was spent on chips, so the amount spent on candy bars is:
\[ 4.95 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. So, the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends equally.

To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\(20 \div 4 = 5\)

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

Each friend received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. 

Each piece would weigh \( \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \).

Together, Rory and her mom have \( 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \).

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs \( 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \).

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to share these 56 oranges equally among Sitti, Juris, and their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people in total (2 of them plus 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, he should leave 4 minutes before the premiere starts. Therefore, Bernadette should leave \(4 + 5 = 9\) minutes before the premiere starts to arrive first.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Now, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, for 30 minutes, the temperature decrease is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the current temperature:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}

So, the final temperature of the house is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. The total time for James is:

- Total time for James = 36 + 85 + R

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Rozanne starts with 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The remaining sneakers are \(48 - 17 = 31\). These were sold to a department store at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost is the cost of the entire case, which is $576. So, the profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[
\boxed{539}

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain sixteen pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons/packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ 112 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket for any movie: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21
2. Regular ticket for any movie: $12
3. Regular price of popcorn: \( P \)
4. Regular price of soda: $3
5. You didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2.

If you didn't buy the super ticket, you would have bought a regular ticket for $12 and a popcorn and soda at regular price. The total cost in this scenario would be:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the cost of the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. 

First, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she trades:
3 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $2400

After the trade, she has 5 sapphires left:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She also gains 2 rubies from the trade:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = \(3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490\) pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

- Number of trips = \(\lceil \frac{4490}{2250} \rceil = \lceil 2.0044 \rceil = 3\).

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."

3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents (from cans) + 15 cents (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip, which is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. Since the cost of the pizza is $15, the tip would be:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 100 (last place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 + 2 = 98\).
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 - 3 = 95\).
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(95 + 1 = 96\).

So, Finley finished in 96th place."
"Miss Maria has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she has a total of:

\[6 \times 25 = 150 \text{ basketball cards}\]

She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so she has a total of:

\[5 \times 40 = 200 \text{ baseball cards}\]

Adding the basketball and baseball cards together, she has:

\[150 + 200 = 350 \text{ cards}\]

She keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[350 - 50 = 300 \text{ cards}\]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[300 \div 10 = 30 \text{ students}\]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet to match the units of the shark's body length. There are 12 inches in a foot.

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is \( 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \) foot.

The shark's body length is 10 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Plane Tickets**: $5000 each for two people, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price is $1500 per day. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. So, the increased price per day is $1500 + (20% of $1500) = $1500 + ($1500 * 0.20) = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. For 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total Cost**: Adding the plane tickets and the hotel cost, we get $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

So, the total cost of the trip is $15,400."

"Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20 songs. So, Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to his player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for one pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack) + $0.00 (for the second pack) = $4.00.

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 4 razors/pack * 2 packs = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25/razor.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is 25 cents."

\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in terms of \(D\) into the first equation:
\[L + D + B = 43\]
\[(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43\]
\[4D + 7 = 43\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[4D = 36\]

Divide by 4:
\[D = 9\]

Now, we can find \(L\) and \(B\):

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Grandma's yarn usage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total yards of yarn used:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can determine the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as:

Length of the couch = 2 × Width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 × 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$144.00 \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week, so she takes a total of:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

Final numerical answer:
$2.00"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

So, the farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, and the zoo has 20 sheep and an unspecified number of cows. 

To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows and sheep together:

30 cows (from the farm) + 20 sheep (from the zoo) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days Andy has to lose the weight:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose 30 lbs.
   - Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th.
   - The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July (up to July 19th): 19 days
   - Total days = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 days

2. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   - To lose 1 lb, Andy needs to create a 3500 calorie deficit.
   - For 30 lbs, the total calorie deficit needed is:
     30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     105,000 calories / 190 days = 552.63 calories/day

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday."

"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Determine the total amount of water she needs based on the distance.

First, we calculate the total distance:
- Each lap is 0.25 km.
- Hannah runs 8 laps.

Total distance = 8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Next, we calculate the total amount of water:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- The total distance is 2 km.

Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Julie starts with $500.
2. She spends 20% of it on clothes. So, the amount spent on clothes is \( 500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 100 \) dollars.
3. After buying clothes, she has \( 500 - 100 = 400 \) dollars left.
4. She then spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs. So, the amount spent on CDs is \( 400 \times \frac{25}{100} = 100 \) dollars.
5. After buying CDs, she has \( 400 - 100 = 300 \) dollars left.

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each for $4, so the total number of bags she bought is:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

The total cost for these bags is:

\[ 40 \times 4 = \$160 \]

She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling all the bags is:

\[ 40 \times 8 = \$320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 320 - 160 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving half to his sister, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:

\[6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\]

Therefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device. The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
\[ (12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour}) \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then in one day, that person can paint \( \frac{1}{10} \) of a house. 

If 5 people are working together, they can paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \) of a house in one day. 

To paint a whole house, it would take them \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \) days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) hours.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

From point 2, we can say that Ophelia has \(C_O - 2\) chairs, where \(C_O\) is the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:
\[C_O - 2 = 20\]
Solving for \(C_O\):
\[C_O = 20 + 2 = 22\]
So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

From point 3, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[3 \times 22 = 66\]
Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[66 - 2 = 64\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas:
\[20 + 64 = 84\]

Total number of chairs:
\[22 + 66 = 88\]

Total number of sofas and chairs:
\[84 + 88 = 172\]

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This means he would have $4 left. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy with the remaining $4 is:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, he worked out for 4 hours in \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, we can calculate the total hours:

- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80

2. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

4. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55: \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

Cost of the printer = Cost of the computer - $400
Cost of the printer = $1,100 - $400
Cost of the printer = $700

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of one monitor:

Total cost = Cost of the computer + 2 * Cost of one monitor + Cost of the printer
$2,400 = $1,100 + 2 * Cost of one monitor + $700

Now, we can solve for the cost of one monitor:

$2,400 = $1,100 + 2 * Cost of one monitor + $700
$2,400 = $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor
$2,400 - $1,800 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
$600 = 2 * Cost of one monitor
Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
Cost of one monitor = $300

The cost of one monitor is $300."

"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the total bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill:

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total Bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you and your wife want to split the bill evenly, each of you will pay half of the total bill:

\[ \text{Your Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy starts with $6.
   - He adds $5 to his share: $6 + $5 = $11.
   - He adds another $10 the following day: $11 + $10 = $21.
   - He spends $8: $21 - $8 = $13.

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8: $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings for the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings for the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 1125 \).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

8. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Final numerical answer:

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
   \[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

2. For the amount over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   \[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to get her total earnings:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He expects 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill will need to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 2 \times 5 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to Save}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{80}{40} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = 2 \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( x \).
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups.
4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which means \( x = 4 \).

Now, we need to find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. Currently, Juan drinks \( 5x \) cups, and he needs to reduce it to 4 cups.

Substituting \( x = 4 \) into the equation for Juan's current coffee intake:
\[ 5x = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from 20 cups to 4 cups. The reduction in cups is:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

\[32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}\]

Final numerical answer:
82 degrees"
"The first step is to determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs:

1 candle for the 12-year-old son + 1 candle for the 8-year-old son = 2 candles.

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, and he only needs 2 candles, he can buy a pack that contains 5 candles and have 3 extra candles left over. However, since he can't buy a fraction of a pack, he needs to buy 1 pack of candles.

The cost of one pack of candles is $3. Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, the number of pages she can read in 1 minute is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Therefore, the number of pages she read in 105 minutes is:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin, we divide the total number of crayons by 8:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds:

50 (days 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 300 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7) to find the average:

300 birds / 7 days = 42.857142857142854 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average is approximately 43 birds per day.

Final numerical answer:
43"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
3. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). Here, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the starting value.
\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Step 2: Add this value to the starting value and then divide by 5.
\[ \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12.
\[ 6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the final value of the number train is \( 48 \)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let's denote the correct temperature setting as \( T \). Then:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house. 

Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

120"
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
(1600 / 200) * 100 = 8 * 100 = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and eating Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will be bringing their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the cost of Amazon's shipping, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The height of the beanstalk doubles every day, so we can express the height on day \( n \) as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: \( h(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Final answer:

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so for 2 implants, it's:
   \[2 \times 2000 = 4000\]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Each gumball costs a nickel, so we need to find out how many nickels he has in total.

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, so 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has **104 games**."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we can calculate the time required to travel 2000 miles:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds (Ruiz)} + 90 \text{ pounds (Marissa)} = 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:

\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. So, the amount of money he has left is:

\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four hours and the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Total cups sold in the first four hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
- Total money earned in the first four hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Total cups sold in the next two hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
- Total money earned in the next two hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the money earned from both parts to get the total earnings:
- Total money earned = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ \text{Cost per washing in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 20 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, we need to find the cost per individual pump, not the total cost for 60 washings. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{1200}{60} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the given values, we can still calculate how much he would be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks for the remaining money, and Joe would not have any money left and would be short by $2.50, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \text{Joe will have } -2.50 \text{ dollars left after the purchase.} \]

However, if we strictly follow the question's request for the remaining money (assuming no negative value is acceptable), the answer would be:
\[ \text{Joe will have } 0 \text{ dollars left after the purchase.} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

So, it costs \(\$65,960\) more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining 5 months are part of the total 50 months of research.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - Therefore, the cost per month for the remaining 5 months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the remaining 5 months:
- Cost for 5 months = 5 * $150,000 = $750,000

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 5 months to get the total cost of the research:
- Total cost = $100,000 + $750,000 = $850,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $850,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

93000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for water in a year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators:

Seats occupied by administrators = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

Seats occupied by parents = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

Seats occupied by students = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights on the road is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Final numerical answer:
76"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

For the first DVD:
- Total play times before breaking: 1000
- Times already played: 356
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 356 = 644

For the second DVD:
- Total play times before breaking: 1000
- Times already played: 135
- Remaining play times: 1000 - 135 = 865

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times: 644 + 865 = 1509

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

So, the remaining gum after these chews is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Jim then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the gum left with Jim is:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"

For the baseball coach:
- Number of baseballs bought: 9
- Cost per baseball: $3
- Total cost for baseballs: 9 * $3 = $27

For the basketball coach:
- Number of basketballs bought: 8
- Cost per basketball: $14
- Total cost for basketballs: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the total cost for the baseballs from the total cost for the basketballs:
- Difference in cost: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden.

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

\[ 160 \]"
"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

1. First, convert kb/s to Mb/s:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

2. Then, convert Mb/s to Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, for three days, the total number of cars towed is:

\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

On the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than on the first three days, which means it pulled:

\[ 10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]

So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:

\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed on the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \text{James made} = 17,500 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we have:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders} \]

Next, we know that 60% of these riders who can stay upright are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women} \]

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is:

"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

The total cost for the classes is $60, and there are 10 classes in total. Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes.

The cost per class would then be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Then, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class would exceed $10. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Sum the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for both:
\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges together, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, we calculate Tim's annual earnings by multiplying his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\$378,000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for dress pants = \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $20 per hour (since Lorie earns $10 per hour).

If Karen works 3 hours per day, she earns $20 * 3 = $60 per day.

In two days, Karen earns $60 * 2 = $120.

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
6x = 96 \times 36
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \times 36}{6} = 16 \times 36 = 576
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the group will exceed this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 6 minutes (to the corner) - 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which totals $2 * 2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which totals $3 * 2 = $6

$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Together, they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

They eat 10 of the cookies, so the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80.

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet and the other twin would be the same age as the younger triplet and the younger twin, respectively, because they are part of a set of twins and a set of triplets. So, the age of the other triplet is also \( x \), and the age of the other twin is also \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of all four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the age of the younger triplet is 7.5 years. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we'll add up the time John needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we'll subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. 

100 minutes"
"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Now, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, to find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   - Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong.
   - So, Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

2. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong in 10 years:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.
   - Therefore, Rong saves \( 20 \times 120 = 2400 \) coins in 10 years.

3. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by Neil in 10 years:**
   - Neil saves 28 coins per month.
   - In 10 years, there are 120 months.
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 28 \times 120 = 3360 \) coins in 10 years.

4. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years:**
   - Rong saves 2400 coins.
   - Neil saves 3360 coins.
   - Therefore, the total number of coins saved by both is \( 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \).

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from the previous equation into the total bill equation:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \):
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

7. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \),
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \),
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \),
   - \( T = 100 \).

So, the total bill is $100.

8. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is **$32.0**."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

**Final Answer:**
Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream."
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks."
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden would need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the area that needs to be covered, which is two thirds of the 36 sq ft bathroom.
2. Determine the number of tiles needed for that area, given that 24 tiles are required for each square foot.

First, let's find two thirds of the 36 sq ft bathroom:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, since Mr. Boarden needs 24 tiles for each square foot, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Savings:**
   - Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:

\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:

\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ 385,000 \]"
"To calculate the total calories in John's omelet, we need to consider the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, we add up the calories from all the ingredients:
- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for both feet when her arms are down:
- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute
- Combined: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute

Next, let's calculate the taps per minute for both feet when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute
- Combined: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute

Now, we know that she dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and her arms down for the remaining 3 minutes.

The number of taps when her arms are down:
\[550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}\]

The number of taps when her arms are raised:
\[400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}\]

Adding these together gives the total number of taps:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each of the five friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
   \[5 \times 12 = 60\]

2. Bryce and two of his friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
   \[12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8\]
   So, the three friends ate a total of:
   \[3 \times 8 = 24\]

3. The two remaining friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
   \[12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9\]
   So, the two friends ate a total of:
   \[2 \times 9 = 18\]

4. The total number of slices eaten is:
   \[24 + 18 = 42\]

5. The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:
   \[60 - 42 = 18\]

So, the final number of slices of pizza left is:

"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:

\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 9B = 90 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
112"
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the number of blue spools.

- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the cost for adults is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the cost for children is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two parks:
- The difference is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To calculate the savings, we need to determine the difference in cost per tomato and then multiply that by the number of tomatoes sold per day, and finally, multiply by the number of days in a week.

1. The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
2. The cost per tomato with the old vendor was $0.50.
3. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are 500 * $0.10 = $50.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

The vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Combined marbles = 224 + 112
Combined marbles = 336

The final numerical answer is:
336"

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays in a 4-week month:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - So, in one 4-week month, 60 chairs are rented each weekday, which means \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs are rented during weekdays in one 4-week month.

2. **Weekends in a 4-week month:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - So, in one 4-week month, 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, which means \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs are rented during weekends in one 4-week month.

3. **Total chairs rented in one 4-week month:**
   - Adding the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends, we get \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs in one 4-week month.

4. **Total chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, in two 4-week months, the total number of chairs rented will be \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

**Final numerical answer:**
4000"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas, so Gunther was left with \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas, so he had \(24 + 25 = 49\) bananas.
4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with \(49 - 12 = 37\) bananas.
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas, so he had \(37 + 6 = 43\) bananas.

Therefore, the final number of bananas in the pile is 43."
"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
2. Multiply the monthly share by 12 to get the annual share for each roommate.

Step 1: The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally. So, the monthly share for each person is:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: To find the annual share, we multiply the monthly share by 12:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.

8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 102 small buttons and 100 large buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 102 + 100 = 202.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. 11 students need size extra-small.
2. Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium, so \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.
5. Six more students need size extra-large than large, so \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, to find the number of cases needed for the third house, we calculate \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

Remaining time = Total time - Reading time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Video game time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

Now, we can calculate the time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

Soccer time = Remaining time - Video game time - Reading time = 9 hours - 3 hours - 3 hours = 3 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Soccer time / Total time) * 100

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (3 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 25%

So, Tatiana spends 25% of her weekend playing soccer."

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries Emma collects as \( B_e \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level as \( T_e \).

For Ava, the number of enemies she jumps on is \( E_e + 8 \), the number of berries she collects is \( B_e + 3 \), and the number of seconds left on the timer when she finishes the level is \( T_e + 4 \).

The points for each player can be calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(T_e + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 + 30T_e + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e + 215) - (10E_e + 5B_e + 30T_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, and twice the usual time (which is 3 times) on 2 other days.

First, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days:
3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 2 special days:
2 * 3 rides/day * 2 days = 6 rides

Now, add the number of rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 6 rides = 21 rides

So, they ride their bikes 21 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish, and after buying more, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step. First, let's simplify the second equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):

\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, we add these two equations together to eliminate \( W \):

\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now that we have \( O = 13 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( W \):

\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Since the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature that needs to be raised is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, let's determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of these groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow the changes in the number of people on the train step by step.

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more get on. So, the change in the number of people is:
   \[
   172 - 47 + 13 = 135 + 13 = 148
   \]
   So, after the first stop, there are 148 people on the train.
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, the change in the number of people is:
   \[
   148 - 38 = 110

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
3. Both cars travel for 2 hours.

Distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%. Therefore, 400 fifth-graders * 0.8 = 320 passed.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 700\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is then:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

**Final Answer:**
12 dollars"
"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

The amount of salt is denoted as \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

According to the problem, the total amount of ingredients used is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it further:

\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are the amounts of citrus zest and salt respectively, and we need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), we need to express \( s \) in terms of \( z \) or find a specific value for \( s \).

From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) as:

\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can test possible values for \( s \). If we let \( s = 1 \):

\[ z = 5 - 2(1) = 3 \]

This gives us:

- Citrus zest \( z = 3 \) ounces
- Fragrance \( z = 3 \) ounces
- Salt \( s = 1 \) ounce
- Sugar \( s = 1 \) ounce
- Oil \( 2s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) ounces

Checking the total:

\[ 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 \]

The total is correct, so the amount of oil used is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John spends $500 on each of the 3 goats, so the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

He spends $1500 on each of the 2 cows, so the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \]

Adding the cost of the goats and the cows together gives the total amount of money John spent:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \]

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, the number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time she walked in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the amount he earns in a day.
3. Calculate the amount he earns in a week.

Step 1: Number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the number of tasks per day = 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day.

Step 2: Earnings per day
Each task pays $1.20.
So, the earnings per day = 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day.

Step 3: Earnings per week
John works a full 7-day week.
So, the earnings per week = $180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week.

Final numerical answer:
$1260"
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (first game) + 4 (second game) = 18 points.

Total points Sasha scored during both games: 18."
"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
2. Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
3. Subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food × Tins per package
   = 8 × 11
   = 88 tins

2. Total tins of dog food = Number of packages of dog food × Tins per package
   = 6 × 6
   = 36 tins

3. Difference in tins = Total tins of cat food - Total tins of dog food
   = 88 - 36
   = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00
     \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She then buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.

Mulan has $60 left."
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. So, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount after the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14,000} \]"
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Monthly recording time = 288 minutes.
- Monthly writing time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Monthly makeup time = 360 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided.

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This cost is $129.00.

2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. This means she needs 2 additional mirrors, 1 additional chandelier, and 10 additional pictures installed.

3. Each additional item costs $15.00.

Now, let's calculate the additional cost:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding these additional costs to the base installation cost:

- Total additional cost: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00
- Total cost: $129.00 (base installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

1. Let the distance across the highway be \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo be \( S \).

2. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times S \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54S \]

3. Now, each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

4. Let \( T \) be the time it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway. The distance \( D \) can also be expressed as:
\[ D = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T \]
\[ D = 2S \times T \]

5. Since the distance \( D \) is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
\[ 54S = 2S \times T \]

6. We can now solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{54S}{2S} \]
\[ T = 27 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway."
"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total, including the money in her purse, and then determine how much she has in her purse.

The total amount Erika has, excluding the money in her purse, is:
$150 (from her part-time job) + $80 (from her mom) = $230.

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has, including the money in her purse, is:
$400 (the price of the laptop) - $50 (the extra amount she needs) = $350.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
$350 (total amount she has) - $230 (amount from her job and mom) = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for the groups to perform is:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then apply it over the 3-year period.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since this is simple interest, the interest earned each year is the same. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original amount plus the total interest earned:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- So, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts with no collars.

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts with no buttons.

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

If he sells each tray for $2.5, then the total earnings will be:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5/\text{tray} = \$75 \]

The farmer will earn $75."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, so he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

The total number of goats left in both farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

Final numerical answer:

"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, so in a year, he buys:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year, so the average cost per pair of shoes is:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To calculate the total cost, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. The cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. The total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - So, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean those rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

"In the first year, the town will build 12 homes.

In the second year, they will build three times this many homes, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.

By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.

In the third year, they will double the amount of homes built in the first two years, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years will be \(48 + 96 = 144\) homes.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \) or \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[ A + B + S + M = (B - 3) + B + (A - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Since \( A = B - 3 \), we can substitute \( A \) in the equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + ((B - 3) - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, we can find the ages of the other individuals:
- Your age \( A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \).
- Your sister's age \( S = A - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11 \).
- Your mother's age \( M = 3B - 1 = 3 \times 16 - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47 \).

To verify, we add all the ages:
\[ A + B + S + M = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87. \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:

\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

**Day 0:**
- Initial number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- New infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = \$800 \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to calculate 10% of $800 and subtract it from $800:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = \$80 \]

So, Julieta received:

\[ 800 - 80 = \$720 \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

\[ 800 + 720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year (12 months), Claire would earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), the number of books Anne has as \( A \), and the number of books Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180
\]

Next, we know that he plans to sell these chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the cost price of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[
\text{Cost price} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by the boys is:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will make from selling the rope.

The rope is 20 meters long, and she can sell it for $2 per meter. So, the total amount of money she will make is:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

The cost of the new rope will be:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope by subtracting the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope:

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

Final answer:
25 minutes"

"The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On Fridays, they make twice as many as they do on a Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

To find the total number of chimichangas made on those three days, we add the number of chimichangas made each day:

\[125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500\]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"First, let's calculate how many microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. 

20% of 50 microphones is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means that the remaining microphones are:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged with the 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petals on the orchids.
2. Calculate the total number of petals on the daisies.
3. Subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total number of orchid petals = Number of orchids × Petals per orchid
   = 5 × 5
   = 25

2. Total number of daisy petals = Number of daisies × Petals per daisy
   = 4 × 10
   = 40

3. Difference in the number of petals = Total number of daisy petals - Total number of orchid petals
   = 40 - 25
   = 15

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, let's denote the payment per lawn mowing as \( p \).

From the information given, we know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work. Since Joe's lawn was mowed \( x \) times, we can write:
\[ x \cdot p = 6 \]

Now, the total amount Tasha made from mowing lawns is:
\[ (3x + 5x) \cdot p = 8x \cdot p \]

Since \( x \cdot p = 6 \), we can substitute \( 6 \) for \( x \cdot p \):
\[ 8x \cdot p = 8 \cdot 6 = 48 \]

So, Tasha made $48 from mowing lawns.

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $32 from lemonade sales."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left. Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover soup equally between them.

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we sum the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

Therefore, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:

\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops.
2. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Since each lollypop was sold for $0.8, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

   - **Movies on other days**: $7 each
   - **Popcorn**: $8 per tub
   - **Candy**: $2 per box

Given:
- He has already seen 5 movies on Friday or Saturday, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
- He has already seen 8 movies on other days, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
- He has already had 2 tubs of popcorn, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
- He has already had 4 boxes of candy, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Total spent so far:
\[ 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \]

Remaining budget:
\[ 150 - 130 = 20 \]

Now, he wants to see a movie on the last day of the month, which is a Friday, and he also wants to buy popcorn and a box of candy that night.

Cost for the movie on Friday:
\[ 10 \]

Cost for popcorn and candy:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

Total cost for the movie, popcorn, and candy:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Since the remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to see one more movie on the last day of the month, get a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the calories in one mini cinnamon roll are:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the calories in one mini blueberry muffin are:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add the Junebugs from Monday and Tuesday:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Then add the Junebugs from Wednesday:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Next, add the Junebugs from Thursday:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add the Junebugs from Friday:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Now, to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of the other toys:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100, \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100. \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80. \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20. \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30, \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50. \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 (for herself) = 9 balloons.
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons.

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed - Tables they already have = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

15"
"To find the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of these two totals.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Now, we find the average of these two totals:
- Total distance spat by both: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet
- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:

1. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

2. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons:

Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. So, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

So, Patty charged **$205** for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James doesn't like and sells for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Since he sold these 5 CDs, the money he received from selling them needs to be subtracted from the total amount he spent:

$90 (total cost after discount) - $200 (money received from selling 5 CDs) = -$110

The negative value indicates that James actually gained money from this transaction, but the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Since he didn't incur a loss, the answer is:

James was not out any money; instead, he gained $110."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Commission from the New York Times**
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is 10% of $5, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \]

So, the total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

**Step 2: Commission from the Wall Street Journal**
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is 8% of $15, which is:
\[ 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \]

So, the total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

**Step 3: Total Commission**
- Add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

The total commission is:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, we substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we can use the information given about the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

Given:
- 100 pages are printed on each side of a paper.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each paper is printed on both sides, so each paper contributes 2 pages to the book.

First, we calculate the number of papers in the book:
\[ \text{Number of papers} = \text{Thickness of the book (in inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch} = 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ papers} \]

Since each paper contributes 2 pages (one on each side):
\[ \text{Total number of pages} = \text{Number of papers} \times 2 = 150 \times 2 = 300 \]

Therefore, the book has 300 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Therefore, her wake-up time on this day was \(6:00 - 5 = 5:55\) a.m.

4. **Total Sleep Duration on This Day:**
   - Kim went to bed at 10 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to midnight is 2 hours, which is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - From midnight to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is \(5 \times 60 + 55 = 355\) minutes.
   - Adding these together: \(120 + 355 = 475\) minutes.

   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:

\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. So, we can write the equation for the total number of balls as:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have picked up and carried 1 ball, and Jordan would have picked up and carried 4 balls (since Jordan carried twice as many as Jason). This means that \( 2J = 2 \), so \( J = 1 \).

Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the equation for the total number of balls, we get:

\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is:
\[ 2 \]

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. So, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is the net number of holes by the end of the third day plus the holes dug on the fourth day:
\[ 29 + x = 40 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 40 - 29 \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than the others. So, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the number of corn chips each person received:

\[ 70 + 70 + 85 \]

\[ = 140 + 85 \]

\[ = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find 50% of $400, we multiply $400 by 0.50:

\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is $200 more than the cost of the supplies. Therefore, the cost of the travel tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:

\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

So, the total travel cost is:

\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:

\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

If John watches every episode, the total time he will spend watching the show is 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes.

200 minutes"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}
\]"
"To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she arrived home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:

\[ 12 \text{ (initial brownies)} + 6 \text{ (office party brownies)} + 48 \text{ (surprise party brownies)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:

\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (brownies eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.

**Final Answer:**
48"
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

**Total age: 30**"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, the total cost is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes = 1/4 of the total boxes

To find the total number of boxes, we can set up the equation:
8 boxes = 1/4 * Total boxes

Solving for the total number of boxes:
Total boxes = 8 boxes * 4 = 32 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:
32 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 640 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 640 oranges = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept:
640 oranges - 160 oranges = 480 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 480 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, if we add up the cherries that Robert, Richard, and Jerry have, it should equal 60.
4. We know Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, so together they have \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
5. Therefore, Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Jerry has 10 cherries.
- The difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, so we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so that's 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes.

Now, we can find out how many boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday:
- Apple pie sold on Saturday: 15 (Sunday) - 4 = 11 boxes.

**Total sales for each day:**
- Saturday: 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.
- Sunday: 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

**Calculating earnings:**
- Gingerbread cost: $6 per box
- Apple pie cost: $15 per box

**Saturday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 11 boxes * $15 = $165
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $165 = $225

**Sunday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total earnings for two days:**
- Saturday + Sunday = $225 + $315 = $540

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate the price of the red car:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket has 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

1. Calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. Calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. Calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
   - Total soil used = 12 pounds (sunflowers) + 15 pounds (carnations) = 27 pounds.

4. Calculate the remaining soil for planting roses:
   - Total soil available = 30 pounds.
   - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

5. Calculate the number of roses that can be planted:
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs each month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy every 2 months by the number of 2-month periods in a year:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:

- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

Net change in temperature: \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees lower than the starting temperature."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and the Comet orbits every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the Comet would be 75 years later. So, Bill's dad would be:

\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between Bill's first and second sighting of the Comet is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

So, \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam's trousers cost $30.
2. His mother gave him $6.
3. His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = $12\).

Now, let's calculate the total amount Adam received from his parents:
\[6 + 12 = $18\]

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = $12\]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final numerical answer is:
\[12\]"
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Total from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to include the $200 contribution from Walter's friend:

Total including friend's contribution: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. The ""everyone else"" here refers to the total amount collected from the neighbors, the online fund, and Walter's friend, which is $2200.

So, the lawyer's contribution will be:

$2200 * 3 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
1.5 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 6.5 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the 9 hours available:
9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

So, Doctor Jones will have 2.5 hours left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
- 10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.

2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
480"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how many porcupine babies are born each month. Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of porcupines born in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Finally, to find the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we add the number of porcupines born in a year to the original population:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1490} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, they have a total of 34 sticks."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 55.8\% \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of that amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = Total packs × Sweets per pack
Total sweets = 15 × 60
Total sweets = 900

Anne kept two packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2
Packs given to friends = 13

Now, we need to find out how many sweets were in those 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = Packs given to friends × Sweets per pack
Sweets given to friends = 13 × 60
Sweets given to friends = 780

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally to her 10 friends, so the number of sweets each friend received is:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends ÷ Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 ÷ 10
Sweets per friend = 78

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5% of the original price, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the compound increase in price:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and distributed them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Out of the 8 albums, 3 are selfies only and 2 are portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits. The remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3) are not specified, but we don't need to know what's in those to answer the question.

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we can simply add the number of pictures in the albums that are selfies and the albums that are portraits:

\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} + 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, Olivia had a total of 45 portraits and selfies.

Final numerical answer:

"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 30 guests who checked in.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

Now, let's calculate the number of guests step by step:

- Initial number of guests: 100
- Guests after early checkout: 100 - 24 = 76
- Guests after late checkout: 76 - 15 = 61
- Guests after afternoon check-in: 61 + 30 = 91
- Guests after dinner check-in: 91 + 7 = 98

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \)."

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally initially has:
   - 25 red balloons
   - 7 green balloons
   - 12 yellow balloons

2. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

3. Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons:
   - Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

4. Sally finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons:
   - 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added
   - Total blue balloons = 6

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 0%

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher with Extension and Marcus Getting a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this case: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension:

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: 0.5 * 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.16

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.16 = 0.86 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.86 \times 100 = 86\% \]

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles.**

The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy.**

Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time to place all the bottles and drop the candy is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to account for the 4 years he spent in college, during which he did not earn any money.
   - Total amount earned with college = $75,000 * (number of years to pay back the loans + 4).

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay back the loans and the money lost from not working:**
   - Total amount needed = Total amount borrowed + Total amount earned without college.
   - Total amount needed = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Determine how long it would take to earn the total amount needed:**
   - After graduating, Jim earns $75,000 per year.
   - Time to earn $300,000 = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Jim needs pieces that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of the fabric pieces will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50

Total cost for chicken salad = 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad
- Each pasta salad costs $6.00

Total cost for pasta salad = 6 people * $6.00/person = $36.00

Now, we add the total costs for both types of salads to get the overall total:

Total amount Molly will pay = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
Total amount Molly will pay = $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5 (a net loss of $10.5)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

So, the average loss per race is approximately $7.17.

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's original height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To calculate the total hours of work each painter put in, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day to hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in 3 weeks, there are \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days, so the total hours worked by the team is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

Half of them are written in English, so there are \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) English books.

10% of them are written in German, so there are \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \) German books.

The rest are written in Spanish. So, the number of Spanish books is \( 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \).

Final numerical answer:
20 Spanish books."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people descend. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new tiles is \$2400."
"First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident.

The normal cost is $120 a month. The insurance cost increased by 60%, so we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is $192. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per week, and since the machine can wash 2 sets at a time, he needs 2 loads per week for the twins.
- For the king bed: 1 sheet per week, and since the machine can wash 1 set at a time, he needs 1 load per week for the king.

So, in total, he does 2 (twin) + 1 (king) = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they would watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \text{ grams/cat/day} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}\).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down each charge:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, so the total cost is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the total cost is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, let's calculate the number of emails that don't require any response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, the number of emails that do require a response is:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Since James responds to these emails every day, in a 5-day work week, he would respond to:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

320 emails"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate:

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ate 80% of the 40 pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas, leaving:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

The cost to mail each big coupon is 15 cents, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

The total cost for both small and big coupons is:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost in dollars is:
\[ \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion:

1. For the first pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

$125 (rent) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

The total amount of money they have left together is:

\[
60 + 60 = 120

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since the total number of bananas is enough to feed the monkeys for a week (7 days), we can write the equation:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7}\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can determine the cost of a single rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the cost of 15 roses by multiplying the cost of one rose by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change she should receive is the difference between the amount she brought and the cost of the roses:

\[ \text{Change} = 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \div 0.25 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters."

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference in cost between buying individually and buying in bunches:
- The cost of buying individually is $32.
- The cost of buying in bunches is $30.
- Therefore, the amount saved is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest of the bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

**Final Answer:**
Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:

\[ 5 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:

\[ 3 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 18 \, \text{bales} \]

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

\[ 30 \, \text{bales} - 18 \, \text{bales} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

12 bales of hay are left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days. First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time:
\[ \frac{1600}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this amount of time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 + 200 = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

After the first bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its initial height:
\[ \text{Height after first bounce} = 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce:
\[ \text{Height after second bounce} = 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Converting \(\frac{32}{3}\) to a decimal gives approximately 10.67 feet.

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
The cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
4. Ellen's brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.

Now, let's count the remaining sodas:
- Initially, there were 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.
- After Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, there are 2 unshaken sodas left.
- After Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 0 unshaken sodas left.

So, there are 2 shaken sodas and 0 unshaken sodas remaining. Ellen's friend will only get a shaken soda.

The total number of remaining sodas is 2 (both are shaken).

The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of remaining sodas, expressed as a percentage:

\[ \text{Probability} = \left( \frac{2}{2} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 100%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the distances traveled by both trains gives us the total distance between them after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To find out how old Jeff is, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine Martha's age.
2. Use Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

First, we know that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20 \]

Next, we know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:

- Lunch: 30 minutes
- Break 1: 15 minutes
- Break 2: 15 minutes

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on breaks and lunch.

After 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:

5 days * 1 hour/day = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. Together, Amber and Micah ran \(8 + 28 = 36\) miles.
4. Since the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, Ahito must have run \(52 - 36 = 16\) miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \)."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - The amount saved each year is $20,000.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years.

Final answer:
Lauren needs to work for 20 more years."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

So, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, which has 30 days, Soledad needs to cover a certain number of miles per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of miles she needs to hike per day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ 8 \]

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"To find out how much each of the books cost, let's break down the information given:

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount spent already: $4
3. Amount left in the budget: $2
4. Number of books bought: 2
5. Cost of each book: Let's call this \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much Anna spent on the books today. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget and then subtracting the amount she had already spent:

\[ \text{Amount spent today} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Amount spent already} - \text{Amount left} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent today} = 16 - 4 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent today} = 10 \]

Since Anna bought 2 books and spent a total of $10 on them, and both books cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent by the number of books:

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Amount spent today}}{\text{Number of books}} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{10}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = 5 \]

So, each of the books cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year is:
50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's dog-walking chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours, so let's say Dior took at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours, but since it's ""well over,"" we can assume it took at least 9 hours (since 8 would not be ""well over"").

Adding up the time for all three chores:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours (minimum, but let's use 9 for the total)

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{mph} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, the distance for one visit is:
\[ 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{560} \]"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by the first four workers, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:

\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

105 pounds"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers Luis had were the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

50"
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Since Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs:

\[ \text{Sarah's eggs} = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. We can write the equation for the total:

\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Arnold painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives us the total weight in ounces:

\[ \text{Total weight in ounces} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs:

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from 64 feet:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so the total number of planks is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

If he sells each plank for $1.2, then the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, the final numerical answer is:

$96"
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Their combined salary is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000.

**Final Answer: $45000**"
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and that this distance is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Time on the beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time she spends walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, we get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. For the 3 trees each with 7 blue birds:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. For the 2 trees each with 4 blue birds:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all these together to get the total number of blue birds:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks:
\[ \text{Total cows} = 50 \text{ (initial)} + 420 \text{ (added)} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Total chickens} = 20 \text{ (initial)} + 210 \text{ (added)} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ \text{Total animals} = 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given.
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then to find out how many potatoes make 18 scoops, we can use the ratio:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 17 green jellybeans.
2. There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, so there are \(2 \times 17 = 34\) red jellybeans.
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60.

Now, let's calculate the number of blue jellybeans. We can do this by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total jellybeans} - (\text{Green jellybeans} + \text{Red jellybeans})
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets.
4. Add the total number of sunflowers sold from the sunflowers and the bouquets over 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.**

The cost of one sunflower is $2, and Faraday earned $26 from sunflower sales per day. So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.**

The cost of one bouquet is $8, and Faraday earned $56 from bouquet sales per day. So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets per day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets.**

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold per day from bouquets is:
\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers per day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.**

The total number of sunflowers sold from sunflowers over 3 days is:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ sunflowers} \]

The total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets over 3 days is:
\[ 84 \times 3 = 252 \text{ sunflowers} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
\[ 39 + 252 = 291 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 291 \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and the revenue.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to first determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

So, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

Now, to find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = \$40 - \$20 = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:
\[ \$40 + \$80 = \$120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \$120 \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After selling 10 square meters, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total amount from selling the remaining land is 30 * $3 = $90.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[400 + (0.60 \times 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ R = 4B \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. First, we express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Then, we express \( R \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y + Y + Y - 28 - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters."

2. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The mural used 12 pints of paint in all.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, the amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can divide the 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color:

6 pints / 3 = 2 pints

So, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[

   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine how much chalk is used each day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Each day, the teacher uses 0.20 * remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to fall below 2 inches.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).
   - \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches (initial amount after Monday).
   - Each day, \( C_{n+1} = C_n - 0.20 \times C_n = 0.80 \times C_n \).

We can set up the equation for the remaining chalk after \( n \) days:
\[ C_n = 2.75 \times (0.80)^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \) inches:
\[ 2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ (0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.80)^n < 0.727272727 \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln((0.80)^n) < \ln(0.727272727) \]
\[ n \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.727272727) \]

Since \(\ln(0.80)\) is negative, we divide both sides by \(\ln(0.80)\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ n > \frac{\ln(0.727272727)}{\ln(0.80)} \]

Calculating the values:
\[ \ln(0.727272727) \approx -0.313261687 \]
\[ \ln(0.80) \approx -0.223143551 \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.313261687}{-0.223143551} \]
\[ n > 1.401 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground, making a total of 6 apples.
3. Newton picked up these 6 apples, so now he has 6 apples in his pocket.
4. Newton put all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground, making a total of 6 apples.
5. Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground, making a total of 11 apples.
6. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples, so now he has 11 apples in his pocket.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total cheese pizza slices needed = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 slices.

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices needed = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 slices.

Now, determine how many cheese pizza pies are needed:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total cheese pizza pies needed = 36 slices / 12 slices/pie = 3 pies.

Next, determine how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total pepperoni pizza pies needed = 24 slices / 8 slices/pie = 3 pies.

Finally, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together to find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy:
- Total pizza pies needed = 3 cheese pies + 3 pepperoni pies = 6 pies.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay has after accounting for the melting is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs per hour.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net number of snowballs built per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages left, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust for the difference:
   - \(109 - 78 = 31\) bandages were used in the third day beyond the half pack, which means they used 25 + 31 = 56 bandages on the third day.

Now, let's calculate how many bandages they started with on the first day. We know the sequence of events and the final count:

- At the end of the second day, they had 34 bandages.
- They used 56 bandages on the third day and had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.
- So, before using the 56 bandages on the third day, they had \(78 + 56 = 134\) bandages.
- At the end of the second day, they had 34 bandages, so they started with \(134 - 34 = 100\) bandages on the first day.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

The final numerical answer is:
$100"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"

"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If there are ten sharks, then the total amount of blood in ten sharks is:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

1200 gallons"
"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into steps and sum up the numbers:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:

"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Final numerical answer:
75"
"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = \( 66 - 22 = 44 \).

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   - Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = \( 22 + 20 = 42 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, she loses 4 colors: \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors from that set. She had 18 colors from the makeup sets, and she uses up 3, so she has \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors left from the makeup sets.
6. Adding the remaining colors from the palettes and the makeup sets: \(4 + 15 = 19\) colors.

So, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left.

**Final Answer: 19**"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the first floor to the second floor (which is the same as the height of the second floor) is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their share:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the loan amount John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan amount John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover money after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover money} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

So, the selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:

- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:

"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the amount of medicine in one dose.

For one dose:
- Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She combines 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in one dose is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:

"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of John's classes is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity of John's classes} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the combined capacity of John's classes to find the total combined capacity of both schools:

\[ \text{Total combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 1 child's diapers each day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, 1 child's diapers amount to 5 changes. Therefore, Jordan changes the remaining half, which is also 5 diaper changes per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]

3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop enter the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second stop is:
   \[\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]

4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]

5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[20\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 by 8:
\[ 40 \div 8 = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, and each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time required is:
\[ 5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{225 \text{ minutes}} \]"

$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric Luke needs.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the windows.
- There are 5 windows.
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- So, the total width of the windows is \(5 \times 35 = 175\) inches.

Step 2: Multiply the total width by 2.
- Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.
- So, the amount of fabric he needs is \(175 \times 2 = 350\) inches.

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. Cost for the remaining minutes:
   - The call is 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes
   - $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final numerical answer is:
$8.00"

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers (10 nails for the manicure and 10 nails for the pedicure).
3. Add the discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art.

First, let's calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure:

- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure:

Total discounted price for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art to each of her fingers:

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- There are 10 nails for the manicure and 10 nails for the pedicure, so a total of 20 nails.

Cost of nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

Finally, let's add the total discounted price of the services to the cost of the nail art:

Total cost: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

So, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, we add up all the issues:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues per year, the total number of magazines is simply the number of different magazines she subscribes to, which is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ magazines} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ magazines} \]"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's break down the price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 standard 1-hour lessons. His standard rate is $80 per hour, so for 4 lessons:

\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:

\[ \$80 - (25\% \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

For 2 lessons at the reduced rate:

\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time in minutes for the custodian over the 5 days.**

The custodian works 8 hours a day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour.

Time available per day = 8 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day
Number of days = 5

Total available time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time = 2400 minutes

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

   - Half the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, so \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Total flashlights: \(4 + 16 = 20\)
- Total candles: \(16 + 20 = 36\)

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Final numerical answer:

110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips/person

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Convert the hours spent at work into minutes.
Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes spent at work each day as follows:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day.
It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. Therefore, the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week.
\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish = 7 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish = 12 minutes
- Total drying time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - There are 4 plants.
   - Each plant needs 0.5 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.

"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of that distance on land and the other half in water. This means he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time to hop on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time to swim in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time to hop on land + Time to swim in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."

"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \). Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the whole phone plan:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

The whole phone plan costs $60."

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2, so the total revenue is:

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days in this period, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{210}

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is given as 32. So we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]

\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Third Street:** Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, each child is now part of a group of 3:
   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
4. **Children Leave:** The original 5 children then leave the group. So, we subtract 5 from the total:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

The final number of children following the truck is:
\[
25

"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she has.

Mamou gave out:
- 64 meals on Friday
- 30 meals on Saturday
- 48 meals on Sunday

Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48

Let's calculate that:

64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, subtract the total meals given out from the total number of meals:

1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute."
"James has a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. Let's calculate the total amount in cents.

- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so two nickels are worth 2 * 5 = 10 cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 7 dimes are worth 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Adding these amounts together:

25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents."
"The three sisters are each 16 years old, so their total age is:
\[ 16 + 16 + 16 = 48 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 36"" \times 2 = 72"" \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72"" - 2"" = 70"" \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before the summer, her height was:

\[ 70"" - 3"" = 67"" \]

Therefore, Jackie was 67"" tall before the summer."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).
4. The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Alexandra raises $430. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so we calculate Kim's amount as follows:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we know that Sarah raises $300. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so we calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we sum the amounts raised by all four girls:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 + 300 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time taken by Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of line."

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
