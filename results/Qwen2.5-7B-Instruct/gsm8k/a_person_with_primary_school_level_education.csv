"First, let's find out how many eggs Janet has left after she uses some for breakfast and for baking muffins.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.

So, the total number of eggs she uses is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

Now, subtract the number of eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid:

\(16 - 7 = 9\)

Janet has 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.

She sells each egg for $2.

So, the money she makes from selling the eggs is \(9 \times 2 = 18\).

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

**Final Answer:**
18"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Half of 2 is 1. So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber.

In total, it takes:
2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts of fiber."
"First, we need to find out the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

To find the increase in value:
\[ \text{Increase in value} = 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house after repairs is:
\[ \text{New value} = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ \text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break it down into smaller steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many meters James runs in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply 3 by 60:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]
   So, in one session, James runs 180 meters.

2. Next, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a week. Since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the meters he runs in one session by 3:
   \[
   180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
540
\]"
"First, let's find out how much feed Wendi gives to all her chickens in the morning and afternoon combined:

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total morning and afternoon feed: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups

Now, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:

60 cups (total daily feed) - 40 cups (morning and afternoon feed) = 20 cups

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

20 cups"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

Now, Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can group them into pairs to make it easier:

- For every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since 16 glasses make up 8 pairs (because \(16 \div 2 = 8\)), we can calculate the total cost as follows:

- Total cost = 8 pairs \(\times\) $8 per pair = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"First, let's find out how many sheep Charleston has. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep Charleston has as follows:

Charleston's sheep = 4 × Seattle's sheep
Charleston's sheep = 4 × 20
Charleston's sheep = 80

Next, we find out how many sheep Toulouse has. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:

Toulouse's sheep = 2 × Charleston's sheep
Toulouse's sheep = 2 × 80
Toulouse's sheep = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle to find the total number of sheep:

Total sheep = Toulouse's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Seattle's sheep
Total sheep = 160 + 80 + 20
Total sheep = 260

So, together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep."
"First, let's figure out how long it would normally take to download the file without any interruptions.

The file is 200 GB in size, and Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute.

To find out how long it would take to download the whole file:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total size}}{\text{Download speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, 40% of the way through the download means:
\[ 40\% \text{ of 200 GB} = 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \]

To download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After 40 minutes, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart the download from the beginning, so she has to download the 200 GB again.

So, the total time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes (first part)} + 20 \text{ minutes (restart)} + 100 \text{ minutes (second part)} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

Final answer:
\[ 160 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate how far John is from home after driving for 3 hours at 60 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's see how far he travels in the next 2 hours of standstill traffic. Since he's not moving, the distance covered is 0 miles.

Next, he drives for half an hour (0.5 hours) at 30 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. He has 4 hours in total for the return trip, and he has already used 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill + 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph).

Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances he has covered to find out how far he is from home.

Total distance covered = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially and has now covered 135 miles, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

**45 miles**"
"First, let's calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours. She earns $10 per hour for these hours.

For the first 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we need to calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 overtime hours). Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10.

Overtime pay rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are:
\[ \$460 \]"
"First, let's find out how many downloads the program had in the second month. It was three times the number of the first month, which had 60 downloads.

So, for the second month:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

Next, in the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%. To find out how many downloads that is, we calculate 30% of 180:
\[ 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \]

So, the downloads in the third month were reduced by 54:
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

Now, let's add up the downloads over the three months:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen × $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen × $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen × $55/dozen = $330.

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the pastries:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

So, the total cost is $694."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Income**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the income from selling lemons each year is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.
3. **Annual Cost**: It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

So, the net income each year after expenses is \(10.5 - 3 = 7.5\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net income to cover the initial cost of $90.

Let's calculate the number of years:

- After 1 year, the net income is $7.5.
- After 2 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 2 = 15\) dollars.
- After 3 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 3 = 22.5\) dollars.
- After 4 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 4 = 30\) dollars.
- After 5 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 5 = 37.5\) dollars.
- After 6 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 6 = 45\) dollars.
- After 7 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 7 = 52.5\) dollars.
- After 8 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 8 = 60\) dollars.
- After 9 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 9 = 67.5\) dollars.
- After 10 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 10 = 75\) dollars.
- After 11 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 11 = 82.5\) dollars.
- After 12 years, the net income is \(7.5 \times 12 = 90\) dollars.

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's work backwards to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.
2. Before selling at the orange house, she had twice as many (since she sold half at the orange house). So, she had \(5 \times 2 = 10\) vacuum cleaners before selling at the orange house.
3. Before selling 2 more to the red house, she had \(10 + 2 = 12\) vacuum cleaners.
4. The 12 vacuum cleaners she had before selling to the red house were two-thirds of what she started with (since she sold a third at the green house, leaving two-thirds). So, she started with \(12 \div \frac{2}{3} = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18\).

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 

20% of 20 students is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves:
\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:
\[ 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves:
\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Final answer:
60%"
"To find out which purchase will give the merchant the highest profit, we need to calculate the profit from each purchase after the market rise.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market rise: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = Initial value * Market rise
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market rise: 1.2%
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Initial value * Market rise
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2% = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

The profit from the jewelry is $125, and the profit from the electronic gadgets is $96. 

Therefore, the merchant would make more profit by choosing the jewelry, and the profit would be $125. 

**Final Answer:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward.

"First, let's calculate Jill's earnings from teaching:

- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- In one week, she earns \( 20 \times 35 = 700 \) dollars from teaching.

Now, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:

- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- In one week, she earns \( 30 \times 15 = 450 \) dollars from coaching.

Next, let's find out how much she earns in a week from both jobs combined:

- Total weekly earnings = \( 700 + 450 = 1150 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate her annual salary:

- She works 50 weeks a year.
- Her annual salary = \( 1150 \times 50 = 57500 \) dollars.

So, her annual salary is **57500** dollars."
"First, let's figure out how many eggs Claire uses in a week. She makes an omelet with 3 eggs every day, so in one week (7 days), she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ 84 \text{ eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

Final answer:
7"
"First, let's figure out how much time Marissa has in total to complete her hike to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. At an average speed of 4 miles per hour, the total time required to complete the hike is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles) on the trail. So, the remaining time she has to complete the hike is:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to be covered is:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's find out how much water is in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled.

The orange drink is two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Now, 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled. Since the drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, the remaining amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ 6.67 - 0.67 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the remaining water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Samantha's age when Raymond was born:**
   - Samantha is now 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - So, when Raymond was born, Samantha was \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's age when he had his son:**
   - Raymond had his son at the age of 23.

3. **Determine the year Raymond's son was born:**
   - Since Raymond was 23 years old when he had his son, and we need to find out how many years ago that was, we need to know Raymond's current age.
   - Samantha is 31, and she is 6 years older than Raymond, so Raymond is \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.
   - Therefore, Raymond was 23 years old two years before he is now 25.
   - So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago.

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means he paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's call the original price \( x \). According to the problem, 75% of \( x \) is $19.50. We can write this as:
\[ 0.75x = 19.50 \]

To find \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ x = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ x = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

Final answer:
\[ 26 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items we know about:

1. The chicken meal costs $12.
2. The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[17 \div 8.50 = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"First, let's calculate the total cost for each type of clothing item Mishka bought.

For the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- Each pair costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for shorts is \(3 \times 16.50 = 49.50\) dollars.

For the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- Each pair costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for pants is \(3 \times 22.50 = 67.50\) dollars.

For the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs.
- Each pair costs $42.
- So, the total cost for shoes is \(3 \times 42 = 126\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Mishka spent:
- Total cost for shorts: $49.50
- Total cost for pants: $67.50
- Total cost for shoes: $126

So, the total amount spent is \(49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243\) dollars.

Therefore, Mishka spent \(\boxed{243}\) dollars on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. So, in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00.

To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
60 servings ÷ 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Now, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
4 cartons × $4.00/carton = $16.00

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

Final numerical answer:
$16.00"
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles left to travel. Since he stopped again 15 miles before the end, he stopped at \(45 - 15 = 30\) miles. Therefore, the distance he traveled between his first and second stops is \(30 - 20 = 10\) miles.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \(x\) dollars, then we have the equation:
   \[
   x - 5 = 99
   \]
5. To find \(x\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"First, let's find out Darrell's and Allen's current ages.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means for every 7 parts of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 parts. Together, these parts make up their total age.

So, if we add the parts of the ratio together, we get 7 + 11 = 18 parts in total.

Now, we know their total age is 162. This total age is made up of these 18 parts. So, each part is equal to 162 ÷ 18 = 9.

Allen's age is 11 parts, so his current age is 11 × 9 = 99.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

So, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, let's add up all the guesses:
80 (first friend) + 60 (second friend) + 100 (third friend) = 240

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3:
240 ÷ 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80."
"First, let's find out how many hours John spends on the dogs each day. Since each dog takes 0.5 hours and he has 10 dogs, we multiply 0.5 by 10:

0.5 hours/dog * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

Now, to find out how many hours he spends each week, we need to know there are 7 days in a week. So we multiply the daily hours by 7:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \).
2. The number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \) because there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
3. The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ S + S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:

\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

**Final Answer:**
Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

40 ÷ 2 = 20

Now, Aaron has 5 more than this amount, so:

20 + 5 = 25

Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

25 - 2 = 23

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"First, we need to find out how many points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. We know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes and in the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points.

To find 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 1 \text{ point} = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ 9 \]

Final numerical answer:
9"
"First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days he will eat:

2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, we know that 4 yogurts cost $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts, we divide:

60 yogurts ÷ 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we can find the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

15 sets × $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

$75.00"
"First, let's find out how much money John got from selling his lego sets. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

So, John had $195 from selling the lego sets.

Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on the video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

So, John spent $160 on the video games.

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. This means the money he had after selling the lego sets minus the money spent on video games is $5. We can check this by subtracting the cost of the video games from the money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \]

Since he had $5 left, it confirms that the calculation is correct. The question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all his lego sets, he has:

\[ 0 \]

lego sets left.

Final answer:
0"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his speed in miles per hour. First, let's figure out how many miles he runs each day.

John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. He runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's call the distance he runs on the first day \(D_1\).

For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs on each of those days is \(D_1 / 2\).

The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances he runs each day:
\[ D_1 + \frac{D_1}{2} + \frac{D_1}{2} = 60 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ D_1 + \frac{D_1}{2} + \frac{D_1}{2} = D_1 + D_1 = 2D_1 = 60 \]

So, \(2D_1 = 60\). Solving for \(D_1\), we get:
\[ D_1 = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, John runs 30 miles on the first day. On the other two days, he runs half of 30 miles each day, which is 15 miles each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs each day:
- On the first day, he runs 30 miles in 3 hours.
- On the second day, he runs 15 miles in 1.5 hours.
- On the third day, he runs 15 miles in 1.5 hours.

The total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find his speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's find out Dana's running and walking speeds.

1. **Determine the running speed:**
   - Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, which is half as fast as she can run.
   - Therefore, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

2. **Determine the walking speed:**
   - Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk.
   - Therefore, her walking speed is \(6 \div 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking.

3. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time is 6 hours.
   - She spends one-third of the time running: \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
   - She spends two-thirds of the time walking: \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the distance she can travel in each activity.

4. **Calculate the distance traveled running:**
   - Distance = Speed \(\times\) Time
   - Running distance = \(6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12\) miles.

5. **Calculate the distance traveled walking:**
   - Walking distance = \(1.5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6\) miles.

Finally, let's find the total distance traveled.

6. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance
   - Total distance = \(12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18\) miles.

**Final Answer:**
18 miles"
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"First, we need to find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when she holds the sapphire gemstone. 

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for 400 feet. 

When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. So, we multiply 400 feet by 3:

\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. 

To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone:

\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Final answer: 200 feet"
"First, we need to find out how many pieces of apple pie were available at the beginning. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, we calculate the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find out how many calories are in the whole 300g bag of chips. Since it has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories. This means you have:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

left for the day. Since each serving is 250 calories, you can have:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g, you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies. Since one pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00, for 2 pounds, the cost will be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

\[ \$20.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"First, let's find out how many post-it notes Candice used at work. She placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, so she used 220 post-it notes at work.

Candice started with 80 post-it notes and had 23 left after using some at work and buying a new package. So, the total number of post-it notes she used is the difference between what she started with and what she had left, plus the ones she used at work.

Let's calculate the total number of post-it notes used:

\[ 80 \text{ (initial notes)} - 23 \text{ (remaining notes)} = 57 \text{ (notes used before buying more)} \]

Since she used 220 post-it notes at work, and she had already used 57 before going to work, the package she bought must have contained the difference between the notes used at work and the ones used before going to work.

So, the number of post-it notes in the package is:

\[ 220 \text{ (notes used at work)} - 57 \text{ (notes used before work)} = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163."
"First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each blue tie:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since the blue ties cost $40 each, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40
Cost of each red tie = $40 + $20
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the red ties:

Total cost for red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total cost for red ties = 10 * $60
Total cost for red ties = $600

Finally, to find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total cost for red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

So, John spent $800 on ties."
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, 4 feet is equal to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

Now, if each piece of wire is 6 inches long, we can find out how many pieces Tracy obtained by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece.

So, \(48 \div 6 = 8\).

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can calculate the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4:

\[ 120 \text{ units} \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd has per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozen

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

21 dozen * $2/dozen = $42 per day

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294 per week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance isn't given directly. 

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour. So, the distance he travels is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time it takes to travel back is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
5 hours"
"First, let's find out how much weight the comic books remove:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and Uriah removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight removed by the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. So, the remaining weight that needs to be removed by the toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. We compare the total revenue for Thursday and Friday:

- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue is:

- $520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy has. Since Patchy has thrice the number of adopted kittens, and there are 7 adopted kittens, we calculate:

\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \]

So, Patchy has 21 kittens.

Next, we know Trixie has 12 kittens.

Now, we add the number of adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens to find the total number of kittens:

\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the number of lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to add the cost of the ticket and the popcorn together first. The ticket costs $7 and the popcorn costs $7, so:

\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \]

This means each time Peter goes to the movies, he spends $14. Now, we need to see how many times he can spend $14 from his $42. We do this by dividing $42 by $14:

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times. 

The final answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much weight is left for the boxes after the driver and the empty truck are on the bridge. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

So, the remaining weight capacity for the boxes is:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight capacity by the weight of each box:

1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."
"First, we need to find out the cost before the 25% fee and the $3.00 delivery fee were added. The final bill is $40.00, which includes a 25% fee and $3.00 in delivery fees, plus a $4.00 tip.

Let's denote the cost before the 25% fee and delivery fee as \( x \).

The 25% fee on \( x \) is \( 0.25x \), and the total before the tip is \( x + 0.25x + 3.00 \).

This total, plus the $4.00 tip, equals $40.00. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + 0.25x + 3.00 + 4.00 = 40.00 \]
\[ 1.25x + 7.00 = 40.00 \]
\[ 1.25x = 40.00 - 7.00 \]
\[ 1.25x = 33.00 \]
\[ x = \frac{33.00}{1.25} \]
\[ x = 26.40 \]

So, the cost before the 25% fee and delivery fee is $26.40. Now, we need to calculate the final total including the 25% fee and the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ 26.40 + 0.25 \times 26.40 + 3.00 = 26.40 + 6.60 + 3.00 = 36.00 \]

Adding the $4.00 tip, the final price is:
\[ 36.00 + 4.00 = 40.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $40.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we need to add the raspberries in the clusters to the scattered raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
- There are 6 clusters.
- Each cluster has 20 raspberries.

So, the total number of raspberries in the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, we add the 67 scattered raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

"First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. Since 20% of the 25 oranges are unripe, we calculate:

20% of 25 = 0.20 × 25 = 5 unripe oranges

Now, we know there is 1 bad orange, 2 sour oranges, and 5 unripe oranges. So, let's add these up:

1 (bad) + 2 (sour) + 5 (unripe) = 8 oranges

The total number of oranges is 25, so to find the number of good oranges, we subtract the 8 oranges that are not good from the total:

25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 good oranges

So, the final answer is:
17 good oranges"
"First, we need to find out the total cost of the material and the jeweler's work. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler, so:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total amount to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the original total cost to find out how much Janet paid in total:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final amount Janet paid is:

\[ 1430 \]"
"To find Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she gets after 20 years based on the 5% rule.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total annual pension after 30 years.

### Step 1: Annual Pension for the First 20 Years
For the first 20 years, Marcy gets a fixed annual pension of $50,000.

### Step 2: Additional Pension After 20 Years
Starting after 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $50,000, so 5% of $50,000 is:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

### Step 3: Total Annual Pension After 30 Years
After 30 years, her total annual pension is the sum of the fixed pension and the additional pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

So, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500."
"First, let's calculate the amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year. There are 6 months in the first half of the year, and she pays $140 each month.

So, for the first 6 months:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

Next, for the second half of the year, the streaming service charges 10% less. First, we need to find 10% of $140:
\[ 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \]

So, the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year is:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

There are also 6 months in the second half of the year, so the total for the second half is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the amounts for the first and second halves of the year to get the total amount paid for the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ 1596 \]"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to figure out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. We know that she has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

So, we divide the miles driven by the gallons used:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:
\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's figure out how much time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

Now, to find out how much time he spends in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\(9 \times 4 = 36\) hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for players:
- Each school sends 5 players for the girls' team + 5 players for the boys' team = 10 players.
- There are 4 schools, so 10 players/school * 4 schools = 40 players.

For coaches:
- Each school sends 2 coaches.
- There are 4 schools, so 2 coaches/school * 4 schools = 8 coaches.

Now, we add the players and coaches together:
- 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

Final numerical answer:
48"
"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35
Number of rubies = 140

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140
Number of emeralds = 280

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total number of gems = 595

So, there are 595 gems in the chest."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, let's find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are. We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 180 ÷ 5
Number of teachers = 36

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to figure out how much money she got from her allowance and then subtract that from her total amount of money at the end.

Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she gets from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the money she started with plus the money from her allowance. So, if we let \( x \) be the amount of money Bailey started with, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with \(\boxed{60}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. That's 5 days × 5 classes/day = 25 classes.
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, in total, she teaches 25 classes + 8 classes = 33 classes in a week.

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students in a week is 33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students.

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total money she makes in a week is 495 students × $15.00/student = $7425.00.

**Final Answer:**
$7425.00"
"The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Since the first recipe has 20 instructions, the second one will have:

20 instructions * 2 = 40 instructions

To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read for both recipes, we add the instructions from both recipes together:

20 instructions + 40 instructions = 60 instructions

Final numerical answer:
60"
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 \text{ per brownie} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the money from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of \$221."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the five cell phones without interest.

Each cell phone costs $150, and Shiela bought five of them.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 150 \times 5 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
\[ 2\% \times 750 = 0.02 \times 750 = 15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay is the original cost plus the interest:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount in 3 months. To find out how much she will pay each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

So, Shiela will pay each month:
\[ 255 \]

Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to figure out the square footage of each level.

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The second level will have twice the square footage of the top level, so it will be \(16 \times 2 = 32\).
3. The third level will have twice the square footage of the second level, so it will be \(32 \times 2 = 64\).
4. The bottom level will have twice the square footage of the third level, so it will be \(64 \times 2 = 128\).

Now, we have the square footage of each level:
- Top level: 16
- Second level: 32
- Third level: 64
- Bottom level: 128

To find the average square footage, we add up the square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

\[ \text{Total square footage} = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 \]

\[ \text{Number of levels} = 4 \]

\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{240}{4} = 60 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 60."
"Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. 

To find out how many cups of dog food she uses in the first year, we need to know how many days are in a year. A year has 365 days.

So, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
365 - 180 = 185 days

For these 185 days, she feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food each day, so she uses:
185 cups

For the first 180 days, she uses:
180 cups

Adding these together, the total amount of dog food used in the first year is:
180 cups + 185 cups = 365 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food she will use. Each bag contains 110 cups.

To find out how many bags she needs, we divide the total cups by the number of cups per bag:
365 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag = 3.318 bags

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 4 bags of dog food to have enough for the first year.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"First, let's find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we can calculate David's laundry as follows:

\[ \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so:

\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many packages Vincent would need to buy 18 flowers at each price.

For packages of 3 flowers:
- He would need \(18 \div 3 = 6\) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50, so for 6 packages, he would pay \(6 \times 2.50 = $15.00\).

For packages of 2 flowers:
- He would need \(18 \div 2 = 9\) packages.
- Each package costs $1.00, so for 9 packages, he would pay \(9 \times 1.00 = $9.00\).

Now, let's find out how much money he saves by choosing the better price.

The better price is the one that costs less, which is the package of 2 flowers for $1.00 each. So, he would pay $9.00 for 18 flowers at this price.

The cost at the other price (package of 3 flowers for $2.50 each) is $15.00.

To find out how much he saves:
- Subtract the better price from the other price: \(15.00 - 9.00 = $6.00\).

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

Final answer: $6.00"
"First, we need to find out how much the 30% discount is on the $100 grooming cost.

To do this, we multiply $100 by 30% (or 0.30):
$100 × 0.30 = $30

This means the discount is $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

So, the grooming cost after the discount is $70."
"First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, together they got:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we add the amount of water the boy got, which is 6 liters:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 10 \text{ liters} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie started with 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers, so now he has:

"First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight first:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together to find their combined weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights in pounds are:
\[ 623 \]"

2. Then, find out how many thorns are there in total.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses.
Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses is \(3 \times 25 = 75\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of games played is 22, so the sum of the games won and lost is 22. This can be written as:
   \[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
5. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[ 2L = 14 \]
6. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ L = 7 \]
7. So, the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \):
   \[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The football team won 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"First, let's understand Sylvie's salary increase over the years.

1. **Initial Salary**: $600 per month.
2. **Annual Salary**: $600 * 12 = $7200.

After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10% of the initial salary.

3. **10% Increase**: $600 * 10% = $60.
4. **Salary After 5 Years**: $7200 + $60 = $7260.

Now, we need to calculate her salary after three more years, with the same 10% increase applied each year.

5. **Salary After 6 Years**: $7260 + ($7260 * 10%) = $7260 + $726 = $7986.
6. **Salary After 7 Years**: $7986 + ($7986 * 10%) = $7986 + $798.60 = $8784.60.
7. **Salary After 8 Years**: $8784.60 + ($8784.60 * 10%) = $8784.60 + $878.46 = $9663.06.

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9663.06."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Harald's record sold \( x \) copies.
2. Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so it sold \( 10x \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation: \( x + 10x = 88,000 \).
4. This simplifies to \( 11x = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 11: \( x = \frac{88,000}{11} \).
6. \( x = 8,000 \).

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to find out how many guests are expected to show up. Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, 1/4 of 16 is:

16 * 1/4 = 4

This means 4 friends won't come. So, the number of friends who will come is:

16 - 4 = 12

Christina needs .75 gift bags per guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:

12 * .75 = 9

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost for 9 gift bags is:

9 * $2 = $18

Christina will spend $18."
"First, let's figure out how much potato salad a child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:

\[ 10 \, \text{lbs} \div 2 = 5 \, \text{lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. There are 20 adults, and each will eat 10 lbs, so:

\[ 20 \, \text{adults} \times 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} = 200 \, \text{lbs} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. There are 5 children, and each will eat 5 lbs, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{children} \times 5 \, \text{lbs/child} = 25 \, \text{lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring:

\[ 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has 4 pets and Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, Marcia has:

Next, we need to find out how many pets Jan has. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ pets} \]

Now, we add up the pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have to find the total number of pets:

\[ 4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28 \]

"Let's figure out the ages step by step.

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   So, Corey is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   So, Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   So, Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to find out how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee now runs it in 38 seconds and used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can say that Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. To find out how much faster that is in seconds, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds:
10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Final answer: 36 seconds."
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Next, we find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, we add up all the pets to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means there are 80 boys. Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls can be found by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. Since Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the sauce made from the tomatoes is half the volume of the original tomatoes.

2. **Determine the original volume of tomatoes**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the original tomatoes, the original volume of tomatoes must be:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains three tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used **12 tomatoes**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

This means:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

Final answer:
5"
"First, let's find out how many potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, we multiply 2 by 40:

2 potted plants/ledge × 40 ledges = 80 potted plants

Next, Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 ledges, she will give away:

1 potted plant/ledge × 40 ledges = 40 potted plants

Now, we add the 18 new potted plants she received to her original amount:

80 potted plants + 18 potted plants = 98 potted plants

Finally, we subtract the 40 potted plants she will give away:

98 potted plants - 40 potted plants = 58 potted plants

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find out how many doorbell rings there were, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we calculate 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20:

4 glasses/day × 5 days = 20 glasses

On weekends, he only drinks water with 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, and before bed) instead of 4, so:

3 glasses/day × 2 days = 6 glasses

Adding the glasses from weekdays and weekends:

20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses

"To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles. We do this by dividing 42 by 3:
   \[
   42 \div 3 = 14
   \]
   So, there are 14 segments of 3 miles in 42 miles.

2. Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:

So, for a box that is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches:

- The inner length is \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches.
- The inner width is \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches.
- The inner height is \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches.

Now, let's calculate the inner volume of one box. The volume of a box is found by multiplying its length, width, and height.

So, the inner volume of one box is:
\[3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[24 \text{ cubic inches} \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}\]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[72 \text{ cubic inches}\]"
"Let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hour (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours (2 x 1 hour)

Now, let's add up the hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

1 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) + 1 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. So, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:

7 (total hours) - 5 (hours from Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hour), we can find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched by dividing the total time on Wednesday by the length of one episode:

2 hours ÷ 0.5 hour/episode = 4 episodes

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer: 4**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Henry baked \( x \) cookies last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. But he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"First, let's find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without the cashback:

10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Now, let's calculate the cashback for 10 gallons:

10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Finally, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:

$30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

So, after the cashback rewards, the gas would cost $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the number of roll-ups each of them had and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Beatrice had:
- Beatrice's roll-up sheet was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of roll-ups Marcell had:
- Marcell's roll-up sheet was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, let's find the total number of roll-ups they both ate:
- Total roll-ups = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"First, let's figure out how many feet Julia needs to row to reach the shore. We know it takes her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. 

To find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds, we can set up a simple calculation:
\[ \text{Feet per second} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \]
\[ \text{Total feet} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 64 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ \text{Total feet} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. To find out how much water the boat takes on, we can set up another calculation:
\[ \text{Water per 10 feet} = 2 \text{ liters} \]
\[ \text{Total water} = \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} \]
\[ \text{Total water} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

16 liters"
"Each teacher uses the whiteboard in 2 lessons per day. So, for one teacher, the whiteboard is cleaned 2 times (once per lesson) x 3 (times cleaned per lesson) = 6 times.

"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he would have planted:

\[ 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

If 5 of these flowers did not grow, then the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, the final number of flowers that grew is 25."
"First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the capacity of Brittany's phone by dividing 1800 by 6.

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we can find the number of ducks by dividing the capacity of Brittany's phone by 50.

\[ \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has ten of these boards.
- If she sells them at the new price, which is 50% more than $10, the new price is $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has five of these boards.
- If she sells them at the new price, which is 50% more than $16, the new price is $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- $150 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts used are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined, we can find out how much one part is by dividing 120 by 20. 

120 ÷ 20 = 6 teaspoons per part

Since sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 6 by 7 to find out how much sugar she used.

6 × 7 = 42 teaspoons

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So, he buys a total of:

2 pairs/child × 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes.

He paid $360."
"First, we need to find out how many vehicles were already at the port from the 2 containers.

Each container has 5 vehicles, and there are 2 containers:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of new vehicles brought in on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
4"
"First, let's find out how much Adrien's salary was four years ago. The problem states that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

Next, we need to find out how much Adrien's salary is now. The problem says that Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. To find the new salary, we calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to $40,000.

40% of $40,000 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 40000 = 16000 \]

So, Adrien's new salary is:
\[ 40000 + 16000 = 56000 \]

Now, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. The problem states that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. If we let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \), then Adrien's salary four years ago was \( L + 0.30L = 1.30L \).

Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.30L = 40000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 1.30:
\[ L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23 \]

Now, we need to find out Lylah's salary now. Since both salaries increased by the same percentage, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, Lylah's new salary is:
\[ 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to get the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
\[ 56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ \boxed{99076.92} \]"

- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) oranges

Now, let's add up all the fruits:

Morisette's fruits:
- Apples: 5
- Oranges: 8
Total for Morisette: \(5 + 8 = 13\)

Kael's fruits:
- Apples: 10
- Oranges: 4
Total for Kael: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Adding both totals together:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

So, they have 27 fruits in total."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day, so:
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours (same as Tuesday)

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday, so:
- Each of these days: 6 + 1 = 7 hours

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

"First, let's find out the cost of each item:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Dillon:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Finally, let's add these amounts to find the total:

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many minutes the doctors spend with all the patients in a day. 

500 people a day, and each is seen for 24 minutes. So, the total time spent is:
\[ 500 \times 24 = 12000 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, convert the total minutes into hours because the charges are given per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ \frac{12000}{60} = 200 \text{ hours} \]

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour, so the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time is:
\[ 200 \times 150 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. Since the total time spent with patients is 200 hours, the total amount charged to the patients is:
\[ 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost to the hospital from the amount charged to the patients:
\[ 40000 - 30000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of:
\[ 10000 \text{ dollars} \]"

"First, let's figure out how many questions Mark completed in each test.

For the first test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

So, the number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

For the second test:
- Mark completed 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

So, the number of questions he completed in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:

"First, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, the number of queens is 100. Now, the number of baby bees is:
\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And the number of worker bees is:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, since Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, we can calculate how much money he would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games:

$10/hour × 14 hours = $140

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."

- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Next, we add up the cost of the food items:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $11

Now, we add up the cost of the non-food items:
$4

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we calculate the tax on the roach traps:
10% of $4 = 0.10 * $4 = $0.40

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
$4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items with tax:
$11 + $4.40 = $15.40

The final numerical answer is:
$15.40"
"First, let's find out how many clients Kim will have in total. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be:

3 (existing clients) + 5 (potential clients) = 8 clients

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. So, for 8 clients, the total number of bottles of bleach needed is:

8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles

And the total number of packs of cloths needed is:

8 clients * 1 pack/client = 8 packs

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5. So, the total cost for the bleach is:

16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32

And the total cost for the cloths is:

8 packs * $5/pack = $40

So, the total expenses for bleach and cloths are:

$32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

$92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"First, let's find out how many pineapples are in one hectare:
1 hectare = 100 pineapples

John has 10 hectares, so:
10 hectares = 10 × 100 pineapples = 1000 pineapples

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. In a year, there are 12 months, so:
12 months ÷ 3 months = 4 harvests in a year

Now, we multiply the number of pineapples in one hectare by the number of hectares and then by the number of harvests in a year:
1000 pineapples × 4 = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 pieces in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - 1/2 of 30 bees return.
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave.
   - \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the next 6 hours return.
   - Bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return: \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees.
   - Bees that left in the next 6 hours: 60 bees.
   - Total bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 15 + 60 = 75 \) bees.

So, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **75**."
"First, let's find out how much the tickets cost in total.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.
The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.

So, the total cost for both tickets is $10 + $12 = $22.

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier was the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received.

So, the amount given to the cashier is $22 + $8 = $30.

**Final Answer:**
$30"
"First, we need to find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends.

So, if we let the number of Dorothy's friends be \( D \), then:
\[ 3 \times D = 12 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we need to find out how many Facebook friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:
16"
"First, we need to calculate the time it takes for Steve to bike home and the time it takes for Tim to skateboard home.

1. **Steve's Time:**
   - Distance: 3 miles
   - Speed: 440 feet per minute

   Convert miles to feet:
   - 1 mile = 5280 feet
   - 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet

   Calculate time:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

2. **Tim's Time:**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 264 feet per minute

   Convert miles to feet:
   - 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet

   Calculate time:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

3. **Difference in Time:**
   - Steve's time: 36 minutes
   - Tim's time: 40 minutes

   The difference in time is:
   - 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

**Final Answer:**
4 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated:

- For the bicycles: 5 people * 2 tires each = 10 tires
- For the tricycles: 3 people * 3 tires each = 9 tires
- For the unicycle: 1 person * 1 tire = 1 tire

Now, let's add them up: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, for 20 tires, the cost is:
20 tires * 25 cents per tire = 500 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 500 cents to dollars:
500 cents / 100 = 5 dollars

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl has in total. He buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, we multiply 10 by 6:

10 packs × 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we need to find out how much all these cookies cost. Each cookie costs $0.10, so we multiply the number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

60 cookies × $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost of the cookies from the amount he paid:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the final numerical answer is:

$4.00"
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Let's say the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the number of fries left is \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the number of fries left after the seagull ate is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so the pigeons ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so the number of fries left after the raccoon ate is \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \).

6. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the number of fries left after the ants ate is 5. This means that before the ants ate, there were 6 fries (5 fries plus the 1 fry they carried off).

So, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 30 = 6 \times 3 \]
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]
\[ x = 18 + 30 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long.
- So, for each of these days, he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in classes.

Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes:

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long.
- So, for each of these days, he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in classes.

Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total hours for these days in a week is:
\[4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours/week}\]

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week by adding the hours from both types of days:
\[9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester is:
\[17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final answer is:
\[272\]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches, then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we add the total lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[280 \text{ feet}\]"
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas needed by all the apes each month.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas.

So, the total number of bananas needed each month is:
200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to double the monthly amount to find out the total for 2 months:
700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the other end and 100 yards back).

Blake's total distance:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. So, each round trip is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

Kelly's total distance:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

Final answer:

"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, the depth on Tuesday was:

17 feet (Monday) + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water was two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of fish Locsin caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish

- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught.

Anakin's total:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
Total for Anakin: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\)

Locsin's total:

"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step.

1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase**: The price increases by 20% every two months. This means every two months, the price is multiplied by 1.20 (which is 100% + 20% = 120% or 1.20 in decimal form).

3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, the number of increases is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

4. **Final Price Calculation**: The final price after 18 increases can be calculated by multiplying the initial price by 1.20, 18 times. This can be written as:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Power**: We need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Multiply by Initial Price**: Now, multiply this result by the initial price of $20:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

So, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."

1. **Determine the cost of a red car:**
   - We are given that one red car costs $4.

2. **Determine the cost of an action figure:**
   - We are given that an action figure costs $5.

3. **Determine the cost of the doll:**
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the doll costs $15.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all the red cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4.
   - So, the total cost of the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost of all the action figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5.
   - So, the total cost of the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

6. **Calculate the total cost of all the toys:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the red cars, the action figures, and the doll.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought and then subtract that total from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's sum these amounts:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102 \]

Adding step by step:
\[ 1090 + 157 = 1247 \]
\[ 1247 + 74 = 1321 \]
\[ 1321 + 157 = 1478 \]
\[ 1478 + 74 = 1552 \]
\[ 1552 + 102 = 1654 \]

The total cost of the items is €1654.

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[ 1500 - 1654 = -154 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Elvira does not have enough money to buy all the items within her budget. She is short by €154.

Final answer:
\[ \text{Elvira will not have any money left for her clothing, and she is short by €154.} \]"
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she needs for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. So, for 15 flans, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ 45 \text{ eggs} \div 9 \text{ eggs/babysitting} = 5 \text{ times} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Brooke's current age is \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

According to the problem, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 28 - 4 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

"First, let's find out how much Jessica wants to pay each month for each debt if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more = $300 * 50/100 = $150
Total payment = $300 + $150 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more = $200 * 50/100 = $100
Total payment = $200 + $100 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more = $500 * 50/100 = $250
Total payment = $500 + $250 = $750

Now, let's add up the total monthly payments:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find out how much she pays in a year:
Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:
1.5 minutes/potato × 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:
5 seconds/potato × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

To convert 300 seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
300 seconds ÷ 60 = 5 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut all the potatoes:
90 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting) = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

**Final Answer: 95 minutes**"
"First, let's figure out how many glasses of lemonade they sold to make $25 in profit.

The cost for lemons and sugar per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

They sell each glass for $0.50, and they get 20 glasses per gallon. 

Let's find out how many glasses they sold to make $25 in profit. 

If they made $25 in profit, and each glass is sold for $0.50, the total revenue from selling the glasses is the cost plus the profit. 

Total revenue = Cost + Profit
Total revenue = (Number of gallons * Cost per gallon) + $25

Let's assume they made 'x' gallons of lemonade. So, the total cost for lemons and sugar is $5x. 

The total revenue from selling the glasses is the number of glasses sold times the price per glass. 

Number of glasses sold = x * 20
Revenue = Number of glasses sold * Price per glass
Revenue = (x * 20) * $0.50
Revenue = 10x

We know the profit is $25, so:
Revenue - Cost = Profit
10x - 5x = $25
5x = $25
x = $25 / 5
x = 5 gallons

So, they made 5 gallons of lemonade. 

The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is:
5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15

Final answer:
They spent $15 on lemons."
"First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese is:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

We are told that 60 of the Chinese were boys. To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

Final numerical answer:
100"
"First, let's find out how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of $6000 = \( \frac{6000}{4} = 1500 \) dollars.
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of $6000 = \( \frac{6000}{3} = 2000 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total spent on rent and car fuel:
Total spent = $1500 (rent) + $2000 (car fuel) = $3500.

Next, we find out how much is left after these expenses:
Remaining amount = $6000 - $3500 = $2500.

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
Donation to charity = \( \frac{1}{2} \) of $2500 = $1250.

Now, we calculate the remaining amount after the donation:
Remaining amount = $2500 - $1250 = $1250.

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
Total given to daughter and wife = $200 + $700 = $900.

Finally, we find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations:
Final amount = $1250 - $900 = $350.

So, the final numerical answer is:
$350."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:

Bo's crabs: 40
Monic's crabs: 40 - 4 = 36

Now, Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:

Monic's crabs: 36
Rani's crabs: 36 + 10 = 46

Now, to find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add up the crabs each one has:

Bo's crabs: 40
Monic's crabs: 36
Rani's crabs: 46

Total crabs: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours. So, he earned:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. So, he earned:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from both weeks:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Since the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got by multiplying 80 by \( \frac{3}{4} \).

First, let's calculate the votes for the winner:
\[ 80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \]

So, the winner got 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find out how many red roses Fred must deliver, let's break down the information given:

1. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
2. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.

First, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. Since the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of pink calla lilies}}{5} \]

Substituting the number of pink calla lilies:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Substituting the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm. 

**160**"
"First, let's figure out Mark's age two years ago. We know Jan is 30 years old now.

Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was \(28 \div 2 = 14\).

Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"Let's calculate the total time for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

### First Team:
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Second Team:
The second team's times are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time:
The faster team (first team) finishes in 220 seconds, while the slower team (second team) finishes in 222 seconds. The difference in time is:
\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by **2 seconds**."
"First, let's figure out the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.

The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 50\% \]

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\% \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[ 50\% - 25\% = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the total amount of straw distributed is 160 pieces. This straw is given to rats, hamsters, and rabbits. We need to find out how much straw is given to each type of animal and then determine the number of rats.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Rats:**
   - Total straw for rats = Total straw - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits
   - Total straw for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Rats in cages:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = \(3 \text{ cages} \times 6 \text{ pieces per rat} \times \text{number of rats per cage}\).

Let \(x\) be the number of rats in each cage. Then:
\[ 3 \times 6 \times x = 90 \]
\[ 18x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{18} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest for each month and add it to the original amount.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2%

Let's calculate the amount after each month:

**After 1st Month:**
- Interest = $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total Amount = $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month:**
- Interest = $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total Amount = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month:**
- Interest = $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total Amount = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12 (rounded to the nearest cent).

**Final Answer:**
$106.12"
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to figure out the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the cost per bag including transportation:**
   - Cost of wheat per bag = $20
   - Transportation cost per bag = $2
   - Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22

2. **Let the number of bags be \( x \).**
   - Total cost for \( x \) bags = $22 \times x

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Selling price per bag = $30
   - Total revenue for \( x \) bags = $30 \times x

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Given profit = $400
   - So, $400 = $30x - $22x
   - $400 = $8x

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \)

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's find out how much they spent on food. They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Since the tickets cost $20.25, the cost for food is:

$20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:

$33 x 2 = $66

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 (the number of friends):

$102 ÷ 3 = $34

So, each of them paid $34."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Trees Planted and Chopped Each Year:**
   - Tom plants 10 trees each year.
   - Tom chops down 2 trees each year.
   - Net increase in trees each year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

2. **Total Trees After 10 Years:**
   - Starting with 50 trees.
   - Each year, the number of trees increases by 8.
   - After 10 years, the total increase in trees = 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees.
   - Total trees after 10 years = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

3. **Trees That Die:**
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die.
   - 30% of 130 trees = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.

4. **Final Number of Trees:**

"First, let's find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, we divide 1000 by 2:

1000 ÷ 2 = 500 sentences

So, Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Next, we calculate how much he earns from Publisher A. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences:

500 sentences × 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

2 × 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence

For 500 sentences from Publisher B:

500 sentences × 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to find out how much Mark makes in a week:

2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the average calculation**: The average score after removing the lowest score will be the sum of the five highest scores divided by 5.

2. **Calculate the total score needed**: Since the average of the five highest scores needs to be 93, the total of these five scores should be \(93 \times 5 = 465\).

3. **Identify the current scores and find the lowest**: Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score is 71.

4. **Sum the remaining scores**: If we remove the lowest score (71), the sum of the remaining scores is \(89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367\).

5. **Determine the required sixth score**: To get a total of 465 for the five highest scores, the sixth score needs to make up the difference. So, the required sixth score is \(465 - 367 = 98\).

Therefore, Brinley needs to score **98** on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"First, let's calculate the kilometers Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, each week he rode:

\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ kilometers} \]

Since he did this for four weeks, the total kilometers for the first four weeks are:

\[ 125 \times 4 = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, let's calculate the kilometers he rode in the following three weeks. He rode 2 times a week, and each time he rode 60 kilometers. So, each week he rode:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ kilometers} \]

Since he did this for three weeks, the total kilometers for the next three weeks are:

\[ 120 \times 3 = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks to get the total kilometers:

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40g = 1000g \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20g = 1600g \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, the final numerical answer is:
76"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - So, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - So, one dozen cups cost \(34800 \div 20 = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - So, the cost of one cup is \(1740 \div 12 = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let's say she mows the lawn \(x\) times and earns $4 each time, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, the total amount of money she has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money she needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
- The amount she still needs is \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn $40:
- The number of times she needs to mow the lawn is \(40 \div 4 = 10\).

So, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer:
10"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of red chickens is \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).

Now, we know:
- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.

So, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is \( 3R \).
The total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is \( 5(R + 2) \).

The total number of eggs collected is the sum of the eggs from the red and white chickens:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
4"
"First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks 15 miles around the park. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he spends walking by dividing the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so:
100 customers + 50 customers = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total.

So, the calculation for the third day is:
500 customers (total by the third day) - 100 customers (first day) - 150 customers (second day) = 250 customers.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the leak rate:**
   - Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

2. **Water loss over 4 minutes:**
   - In 4 minutes, each pool loses \(4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}\).

3. **Initial water comparison:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

4. **Current water comparison:**
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

5. **Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \(S\) gallons.**
   - Then, the current amount of water in the big pool is \(4S\) gallons.

6. **Water loss over 4 minutes:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \(S + 16\) gallons.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \(4S + 16\) gallons.

7. **Using the initial condition:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Therefore, \(4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)\).

8. **Solving the equation:**
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2S + 32
   \]
   \[
   4S - 2S = 32 - 16
   \]
   \[
   2S = 16
   \]
   \[
   S = 8
   \]

So, the small pool now has **8 gallons** of water."
"First, we need to find out how much Lori needs to buy the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori needs $352.00 to make her purchase. Her job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs by her hourly wage:

\[ 352.00 \div 8.00 = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's find out how much Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%.

To find 10% of $2000:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount Janeth promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total over 12 months. She pays $165 each month for 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return to find her remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ 220 \]"
"First, we find out how many dahlias there are. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we add 7 to 4 to find the number of dahlias.

4 (roses) + 7 = 11 (dahlias)

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together.

4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 (total flowers)

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's find out the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Now, let's find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Next, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is 45 years."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \(68 \div 2 = 34\). So, Yuri scored \(34 + 10 = 44\) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she solved 3 of them. So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

She spends 5 minutes on each sudoku puzzle and she solved 8 of them. So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

To find the total time spent on both activities, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles:
30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The tank starts with 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden. So, the water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the water left plus the rainwater collected:
   \[

"First, let's find out how many petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50 petunias

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spends a third of $15000 on advertising. To find a third of $15000, we divide $15000 by 3:

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amount spent in the first year to the amount spent in the second year:

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"First, we calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. Carlos rents the canoe for $30 an hour and uses it for 3 hours. So, we multiply $30 by 3:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. Benji rents the raft for $18 an hour and uses it for 5 hours. So, we multiply $18 by 5:

\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]

Now, we add the amounts that Carlos and Benji pay to find the total cost:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:

"First, we need to find out how many days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. The problem states that it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days by bus, it will take:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

by car.

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. So, the total travel time is the sum of the days it takes to travel by bus to Rochester and the days it takes to travel by car back from Rochester:

\[ 6 \text{ days (by bus)} + 3 \text{ days (by car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's find out how many water type cards James has after losing 8 of them:
40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.

Next, let's see how many grass type cards he has after buying 14 more:
20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

Now, let's find the total number of cards James has:
30 (fire) + 32 (water) + 34 (grass) = 96 cards.

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
( Number of water type cards / Total number of cards ) * 100

So, we have:
( 32 / 96 ) * 100

This simplifies to:
( 1 / 3 ) * 100

Which is:
33.3333...

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda's mom can place per minute. Since Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, her mom can place half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces they can place together in one minute. Kalinda places 4 pieces and her mom places 2 pieces, so together they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them exactly 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

120 watermelons were there, and 30% of them were ready for harvest. So, we calculate 30% of 120:

\[ 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest the first time Ashlyn went. This means the remaining watermelons were:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, we calculate 3/4 of 84:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were ready for harvest. This means the remaining watermelons after the second harvest were:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.

Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars, so:
\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax. The tax is 10% of the total cost of the cars:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a $1000 registration fee and there are 12 cars, so:
\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost including tax:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[ 276,000 \]"

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat:
- Steve: 6 tomatoes/day
- Girlfriend: 3 tomatoes/day
- Total: 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes/day

Now, let's calculate how many tomatoes they need in a week:
- 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, we need to find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.

First, we need to find out how many new pens he can make from the 25 pens he initially has. Since he can make 1 new pen from every 5 empty pens, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, from the 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens. Now, he will have 5 new pens plus the 25 original pens minus the 25 pens he used to make the new ones (since they are now empty):

\[ 25 + 5 - 25 = 5 \]

Now, he has 5 pens. He can't make any more new pens from these 5 pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 5 pens, all of which are full.

So, the total number of pens he has is:

"First, let's find out how old Joan is. Since Joan is five years older than Jessa, and Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Next, we need to find out how old Mary is. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now, to find the sum of the ages of the three girls, we add Jessa's age, Joan's age, and Mary's age together:

Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of ages = 20 + 25 + 23
Sum of ages = 68

"First, we need to find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:

30% of 1000 = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the number of students remaining is:

1000 - 300 = 700 students

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining students went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:

3/5 of 700 = (3/5) × 700 = 420 students

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This means the number of students remaining, who went out through exit C, is:

700 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"First, let's find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can say:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{\text{John's candies}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:

\[ \text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James's candies} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count all the books.

Dolly will read her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 3 books.
Pandora will read her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 3 books.

To find the total number of books read, we add the books read by Dolly and Pandora:
3 (Dolly's reading) + 3 (Pandora's reading) = 6 books

By the end, they will collectively read 6 books."
"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike still has. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he now has:

5 - 2 = 3 pen pals

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, for each pen pal, Mike receives:

2 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 10 pages/week

Since he has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he receives in a week is:

10 pages/pen pal * 3 pen pals = 30 pages/week

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. So, to write 30 pages, he spends:

30 pages * 6 minutes/page = 180 minutes

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.

3 hours"
"First, let's find out how many minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss every day. 

He has 15 minutes of calls each day and there are 30 days in the month, so:

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes he used from his plan:

2. Kyle takes 5 fries. Now Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Now Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's find out the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums.

There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in another. So, the difference is:
32 - 4 = 28 snails

According to the problem, this difference (28 snails) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. So, we can say:
28 = 2 * (number of fish in both aquariums)

To find the number of fish in both aquariums, we divide 28 by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14 fish

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide the total number of fish by 2:
14 ÷ 2 = 7 fish

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final numerical answer:
7 fish"
"First, let's find out how many hours the makeup artist works each week. She works 6 hours a day and needs it done 4 times a week.

So, \(6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week}\).

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total hours she works over the 5 weeks is:

\(24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours}\).

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\(120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$30,000\).

Since Jean gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate 10% of $30,000 and subtract it from the total.

10% of $30,000 is:

\(\$30,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,000\).

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\(\$30,000 - \$3,000 = \$27,000\).

Jean paid \(\$27,000\)."
"First, we need to find out how much Isabelle spent in total on the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the costs:

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, we add these amounts together:

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96.

Next, we need to split this cost evenly among Isabelle and her two parents, which makes a total of 3 people.

To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person pays $32."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought in total. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, we multiply 50 by 4:

50 pounds/bag × 4 bags = 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:

200 pounds × $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

On Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

Calories consumed by Sue:
- Total cookies: 46
- Calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories

Calories consumed by Sue's sister:
- Total cookies: 18
- Calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

Finally, we find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:
- Difference in calories: \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"First, let's find out how many students are in the third class. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so the number of boys in the school is:

\[ 60 \times 0.5 = 30 \]

Now, let's find out how many girls are in the first and second classes. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:

\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \]

Since the school has 30 boys in total, and we know there are 27 girls in the first and second classes, the number of girls in the third class is:

\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Travis started with 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Since he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, he killed \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars today.

So, today he killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:

- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Total animals killed: \(46 + 27 = 73\)

**Final Answer: 73**"
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor.

First, we need to calculate the floor he goes to by using the given formula: 4 times his starting floor plus 6.

Starting floor = 3

So, we calculate: \(4 \times 3 + 6\)

\(12 + 6 = 18\)

Bill is now on the 18th floor."
"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel. 

Mitchel went down 30 times. 30% of 30 is:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down 30 times minus 9 times:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply Anne's number by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

**Final Answer: 84**"
"First, let's find out how many cows Mr. Sylas adds to each stall. He buys 40 cows and divides them equally among 20 stalls.

So, \(40 \div 20 = 2\) cows per stall.

Now, each of the original 10 stalls had 20 cows. After Mr. Sylas adds 2 more cows to each stall, each stall will have \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8.

So, \(22 \times 8 = 176\).

**Final Answer: 176**"

3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes are worth \(20 \times 0.10 = 2\) dollars.
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills are worth \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the values:

\[1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45\]

So, Brady has **45** dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, let's find out how many 10-foot sections are in the 200-foot tall redwood:

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight before termites ate any part of it is:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Termites ate 30% of the redwood. To find out how much weight that is, we calculate 30% of 8000 pounds:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

Now, we subtract the weight that termites ate from the original weight to find the remaining weight:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

5600 pounds"
"Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books. So, we first calculate the total amount for the books:

$0.50 × 8 = $4.00

Since at least one book is over a week overdue, she also has to pay a flat $2.00 fee.

Now, we add the amount for the books and the flat fee:

$4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00."
"First, let's find out how many apples Jamal has. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and Andrea has 52 apples, we can find Jamal's apples by subtracting 8 from Andrea's apples.

So, Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Next, we know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, let's find the total number of fruits.

Andrea's total fruits = 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
Jamal's total fruits = 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

The total number of fruits both have is Andrea's total + Jamal's total = 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

Final numerical answer:
168"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Carla is making in total. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, the total number of cookies is:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Next, we need to determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies. So, we can find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies by setting up a proportion:

2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 66 cookies

To find x, we can solve the equation by cross-multiplying and dividing:

x = (2 cups * 66 cookies) / 12 cookies
x = 132 / 12
x = 11 cups

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake 66 cookies."
"First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup.

To do this, we take the total number of pennies, which is 9,300, and multiply it by two thirds:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = \frac{2 \times 9,300}{3} \]

\[ = \frac{18,600}{3} \]

\[ = 6,200 \]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two thirds of the cup.

Since 100 pennies make a dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100 to find the dollar amount:

\[ 6,200 \div 100 = 62 \]

The total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup is 62 dollars."
"Maddison starts with 5 boxes of marbles, with each box containing 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles in the boxes is:

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

"First, let's find out how many trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ trees} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that number is:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Adding 5 to this number gives us the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We do this by subtracting the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. 

Final answer:
\[ 8 \]"

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]
Samantha has $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]
Daisy has $175.

Now, let's add up all the money they have:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400."
"First, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price of $350,000.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000
Brokerage fee = $17,500

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price of $350,000.

Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000
Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000
Transfer fee = $42,000

Now, let's add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total price of the house.

Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000
Total price = $409,500

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

Extra amount = Total price - Budget
Extra amount = $409,500 - $400,000
Extra amount = $9,500

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.

Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
Transfer fees = 0.03 × $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.

Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $400,000
Brokerage fee = $20,000

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to find the total fees.

Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee
Total fees = $12,000 + $20,000
Total fees = $32,000

Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

Now, let's calculate Mr. Tan's net proceeds by subtracting the total fees and the loan amount from the selling price.

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
Net proceeds = $118,000

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, let's find out how long it takes to heat the oil up to 400 degrees.

It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees. It takes 40% longer to heat it to 400 degrees. 

To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

The time to warm up the oil is 28 minutes, so:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time to heat the oil and the time to cook the chicken:
\[ 28 + 23 = 51 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
\[ 51 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 of them. So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:

\[ 50 \text{ ads} \times \$5 \text{ per ad} = \$250 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the television ads. The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 of them. So, the total cost for the television ads is:

\[ 15 \text{ ads} \times \$75 \text{ per ad} = \$1125 \]

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[ \$250 + \$1125 = \$1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of \$1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler has 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 \div 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up:

- First bag: 300 M&Ms
- Second bag: 312 M&Ms
- Third bag: 150 M&Ms

Total M&Ms = \(300 + 312 + 150 = 762\)

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's find out how many windows are in the bedrooms of both houses.

Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house:
3 bedrooms/house × 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows

Since John has 2 houses, we multiply the number of windows in one house by 2:
6 windows/house × 2 houses = 12 windows in total from the bedrooms.

Now, let's add the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and there are 2 houses:
4 windows/house × 2 houses = 8 windows

Finally, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows together:
12 windows (from bedrooms) + 8 windows (additional) = 20 windows

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"First, we need to add up the cost of the items the mother bought.

The cost of cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of laundry is $9.45.
The cost of pasta is $1.35.

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The total cost of the items is $15.00.

The mother pays with $20.00.

To find out how much change she should get back, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00."
"First, let's find out how many stitches the collar takes. Since the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Next, we find out how many stitches the rosette takes. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Now, we know the total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We can find out how many stitches are used for the sleeves by subtracting the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total:

\[ \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - (900 + 90 + 180) \]
\[ \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:

\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- So, the total amount of money used to buy the seeds is \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
3200"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics of the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - So, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - So, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   - Solo song: 54 lines
   - First scene: 36 lines
   - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, Sean has to memorize **138 lines**."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them.

We then find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them.

Finally, to find out how many cards had the letter D on them, we subtract the number of cards with letters A, B, and C from the total number of cards:

\[ 80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9 \]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ 9 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, it will take:

3 minutes/hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it takes him to dig all the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, it will take:

10 minutes/hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 240 minutes into hours:

240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

4 hours"
"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we can follow these steps:

1. We know that the sum of their current ages is 20.
2. In 10 years, both Mico and Marco will each be 10 years older.
3. So, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages.
4. This means we add 10 + 10 = 20 to their current total age.

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
20 (their current total age) + 20 (the additional years) = 40

Final answer:
40"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation.

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Sam is 6 years old."

"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can say:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas in the snake park.

For the cobras:
\[ 40 \text{ cobras} \times 70 \text{ spots per cobra} = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

For the mambas:
\[ 60 \text{ mambas} \times 35 \text{ spots per mamba} = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total spots of cobras and mambas:
\[ 2800 \text{ spots} + 2100 \text{ spots} = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we find half the number of spots they all have combined:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, half the number of spots they all have combined is:
2450"
"First, let's find out how many people will be at the soccer game.

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- Including the team members and guests, that's \(12 + 24 = 36\) people.
- Plus, there are 3 coaches, so the total number of people is \(36 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people:

- We divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve: \(39 \div 3 = 13\) pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

- The total cost is \(13 \times 15 = 195\) dollars.

Maddy will spend **195 dollars**."
"First, let's figure out how much space the topaz gemstones take up. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and Katerina uses 8 of them, the total length taken by the topaz gemstones is:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches, so the space left for the sterling silver beads is:

\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses, we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead:

\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

**Final Answer: 68**"
"First, let's find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week. 

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so she wrote:
20 stories * 2 = 40 stories

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so he wrote:
40 stories * 2 = 80 stories

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and doubled that number in the second week, so she wrote:
60 stories * 2 = 120 stories

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in both weeks.

Alani's stories: 20 (first week) + 40 (second week) = 60 stories
Braylen's stories: 40 (first week) + 80 (second week) = 120 stories
Margot's stories: 60 (first week) + 120 (second week) = 180 stories

Adding all these together gives us the total number of stories:
60 (Alani) + 120 (Braylen) + 180 (Margot) = 360 stories

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is now. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old he will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

So, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old.

Final answer:
21"
"First, let's find out how much money Kelly has in total.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"First, let's count the stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in these five rows:
\(24 + 12 = 36\) stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the 36 stars from the total:
\(76 - 36 = 40\) stars

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the 40 stars by 5:
\(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"First, we need to find out the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.

So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds if each truck can carry 2000 pounds.

We divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:
6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

So, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"First, let's find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed.

So, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:
\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, we subtract 5 from the number of medals Ali has:

Ali's medals: 22
Izzy's medals: 22 - 5 = 17

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

Total medals of Ali and Izzy: 22 + 17 = 39

The question says that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out. This means the total medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. So, we multiply the total medals they have by 10:

Total medals given out: 39 * 10 = 390

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, we have:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's figure out how long Susan actually works.

She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours in total. But she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, we need to convert 2.5 hours into minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in minutes:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each interval, we multiply the number of intervals by $5:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's find out how many points each player has after the first three rounds.

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra point to each player who has over 20 points in the fourth round.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike now has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony now has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's add up all the points:

- Mike has 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 43 points.

The total number of points is \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

So, the final total number of points after the extra points are distributed is 83."
"First, let's figure out how many oranges each son washes.

The oldest son is 8 years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.
Therefore, the youngest son washes 4 oranges.

Together, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges in total.

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3.

"First, let's calculate the number of activities Darren did on the first day:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for the first day:
\[ 100 + 50 + 20 = 170 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of activities he did on the second day:
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Total for the second day:
\[ 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's add the totals from both days to find the overall total:
\[ 170 + 200 = 370 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 370 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much rice one person eats in a day. Since each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, one person eats:

0.2 kg/meal × 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day

Now, if there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed by the household in a day is:

0.4 kg/day/person × 5 people = 2 kg/day

Next, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount consumed per day:

42 kg ÷ 2 kg/day = 21 days

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the number of days by 7:

21 days ÷ 7 days/week = 3 weeks

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last 3 weeks."
"First, let's add up the crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's add these numbers together:

15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off his target, we subtract the number of crates he sold from his target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"Let's break down the bidding process step by step:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each bid increases by $50.

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

- First bid by Carmen: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid by Carmen: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid by Carmen: $300 + $50 = $350

So, Carmen's final bid is $350. This is the price she pays for the desk.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he drives:

\[ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total miles driven in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total miles driven in a week are:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

Now, we calculate the total miles driven in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total miles driven in a year are:

\[ 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the miles driven in a year. Since he is charged $2 per mile, the total cost for the miles driven in a year is:

\[ 15000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. Since he gives a $150 bonus per month and there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus in a year is:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount he pays a year for driving:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 31800 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. So, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes × 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

78 minutes"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total books in the collection**: 250 books
2. **Books sold this year**: 45 books
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50 books

First, we need to find out how many books have been sold in total so far:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = \text{Total books} - \text{Unsold books} \]
\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, we know that the books sold this year are 45. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as \( x \) and the number of books sold in the second year as \( y \).

According to the problem, the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:
\[ x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and current years from the total books sold:
\[ y = 200 - (x + 45) \]
\[ y = 200 - (90 + 45) \]
\[ y = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = y \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Watson earns from his hourly wage each week.

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

So, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 people

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and he beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
20 - 16 = 4 people

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, we need to find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning.

So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold in the afternoon, and the other half are sold in the evening. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ 10 \]"
"First, let's find out how much weight Joey loses in one week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so:

\[ \text{Weight loss per week for Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in one week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same as Joey in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds, we can calculate the total weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Total weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how much you save on one tub of ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's find out how much you save on one packet of milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream:
- Savings per tub: $2
- Savings for 2 tubs: $2 × 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the total savings for 4 packets of milk:
- Savings per packet: $0.5
- Savings for 4 packets: $0.5 × 4 = $2

Finally, let's add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To find out how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to figure out how many extra arms and legs they will get.

First, let's calculate the number of extra arms:
- An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
- In 15 days, the number of extra arms = 15 ÷ 3 = 5 extra arms.

Next, let's calculate the number of extra legs:
- An extra leg is grown every 5 days.
- In 15 days, the number of extra legs = 15 ÷ 5 = 3 extra legs.

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs together:
- Total new limbs = 5 extra arms + 3 extra legs = 8 new limbs.

So, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he can spend on other things is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 2000 \]

To find out how much Theo has left to spend on gifts, we subtract the total expenses from the amount he can spend:
\[ 4000 - 2000 = 2000 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{2000}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's figure out how many eggs the family eats in one day.

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The rest of the family (which is 5 - 3 = 2 people) eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

So, in one day, the family eats \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Now, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"First, let's find out how old Jane is. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30, we can find Jane's age by subtracting 3 from 30.

So, Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27.

Now, we know Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Since Jane is 27, we can find Trent's age by adding 5 to Jane's age.

So, Trent's age = 27 + 5 = 32.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. 

Cera is currently 46 years old. Six years ago, Cera was:
\[ 46 - 6 = 40 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know Noah's age six years ago was 20 years. Therefore, Noah's current age is:
\[ 20 + 6 = 26 \text{ years old} \]

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population six years ago was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

Since the population six years ago was half of what it is now, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

So, the population of Chile now is:
\[ 120000 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 120000 \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's solve this equation.

First, combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To combine \( 3D \) and \( \frac{D}{2} \), we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2. So, we rewrite \( 3D \) as \( \frac{6D}{2} \):
\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, add the fractions:
\[ \frac{6D + D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

Final answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\) people.

Next, we need to find out how many people couldn't come due to illness and how many had previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\) people.

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- Total people invited: 24
- People who couldn't come: 10

So, the number of people who show up is \(24 - 10 = 14\).

**Final Answer: 14**"
"First, let's find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought.

So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
- Marbles from Johanna: 20
- Marbles from his father: 8
- Marbles already in the store: 50

Total marbles:
\[ 20 + 8 + 50 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ 156 \text{kgs} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of water the pool can hold. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and is 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three dimensions together:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ 120 \text{ cubic feet} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"The classroom has 30 boys.

Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we calculate the number of girls as follows:
3 times 30 boys = 3 * 30 = 90 girls.

For the nongendered children, there are 1/10 as many as the number of boys, so:
1/10 * 30 boys = 3 nongendered children.

Now, we add up all the children:
Boys + Girls + Nongendered children = Total children
30 + 90 + 3 = 123

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

If there are 45 electric wires, we can find out how many sets of the ratio (1 pole and 3 wires) this represents.

To find the number of sets, we divide the number of wires by 3:
45 ÷ 3 = 15 sets

Since each set includes 1 pole, the number of poles needed is the same as the number of sets:
15 sets × 1 pole/set = 15 poles

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"First, let's find out the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
- There were 25 men and 15 women.
- So, the total number of people was \(25 + 15 = 40\).

Next, we need to find out how many people left after an hour:
- \(1/4\) of the total number of people left.
- So, \(1/4 \times 40 = 10\) people left.

Now, we know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's find out how many men left:
- Initially, there were 25 men.
- If 22 men stayed, then \(25 - 22 = 3\) men left.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the rest must be women:
- So, \(10 - 3 = 7\) women left.

Now, we can find out how many women stayed:
- Initially, there were 15 women.
- If 7 women left, then \(15 - 7 = 8\) women stayed.

So, the final number of women left at the party is 8."
"First, let's find out how much the magazine costs. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and a book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

Cost of magazine = Cost of book / 2
Cost of magazine = $4 / 2
Cost of magazine = $2

Now, we know that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. So, we can find the cost of the pen by subtracting $1 from the cost of the magazine:

Cost of pen = Cost of magazine - $1
Cost of pen = $2 - $1
Cost of pen = $1

So, the pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Jam has 26 pencils in total, including 2 loose pencils. This means the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have together:

Jam has 26 pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils.

So, together they have:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils. We know that Jam has 3 boxes that together hold 24 pencils. So, each box holds:

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box.

To find out how many boxes they need for 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes.

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9 boxes"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, we divide 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

This means Shannon uses 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Next, we need to calculate how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so for 5 ice cubes:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, we add the weakening effect of the cream to the weakening effect of the ice cubes:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that for every 2 old records, people get 1 new record.
2. 5 people end up with 7 new records.

First, we need to figure out how many old records were traded for these 7 new records. Since 1 new record is given for every 2 old records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

Final numerical answer:
14"
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

Total number of employees = 100

Number of junior programmers = 2/5 * 100 = 40

Now, we know each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. So, the total payment to junior programmers is:

Total payment to junior programmers = 40 * $2000 = $80,000

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. So, the payment for each senior programmer is:

Payment for each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

The total payment to senior programmers is:

Total payment to senior programmers = 60 * $2400 = $144,000

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

Total payment = Payment to junior programmers + Payment to senior programmers
Total payment = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplify the expression: \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \). Subtract 6 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 6 \).

7. So, \( x = 14 \).

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school:
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends:
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 14:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   So, he buys 28 more lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night:
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning:
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To fully charge the phone, it needs to go from 60% to 100%. 

The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points (from 60% to 100%), it will take:

40 percentage points × 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"First, we need to find out how many lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her more. Erin originally has 7 lollipops and her mother gives her 10 more. So, we add these together:

7 (original lollipops) + 10 (from her mother) = 17 lollipops

Next, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. We subtract these from the total she has:

17 (total lollipops) - 3 (given to Ella) = 14 lollipops

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left."
"First, let's figure out how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off. So, $80 divided by $20 equals 4. This means they earned 4 rewards.

Now, on this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The rewards they have are worth $4 (since each reward is $1 and they have 4 of them). But there's a coupon that takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price. So, the coupon takes 2 times $4, which is $8 off.

The total amount they would pay without the coupon and rewards is $43. With the rewards, it's $43 minus $4 (the value of the rewards), which is $39. Then, the coupon takes an additional $8 off, so we subtract $8 from $39.

So, $39 minus $8 equals $31.

The customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

1. Annual pay for Job A: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
2. Tax on Job A: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
3. Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

1. Annual pay for Job B: $42,000
2. Property tax for Job B: $6,000
3. Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
4. Tax on Job B: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
5. Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

44"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 months × $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months × $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the difference between the two offers:
- Difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's find out how many paintball guns they have in total. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (I assume this is a typo and should be Richard) has 5 guns, and Richard has 5 guns. 

So, the total number of guns is:
8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 5 (Richard) + 5 (Richard) = 28 guns.

Now, they want to share these guns equally among the four of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

28 guns ÷ 4 people = 7 guns per person.

So, each of them would have 7 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break it down into simple steps.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of suckers.
- For 8 batches, he needs \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of fudge.
- For 1 batch, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's find out how much Maria's shares are worth after the first year.

Maria bought 8 shares at $8 each, so the total cost was:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$8 + (50\% \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, the value of all her shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$12 - (25\% \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

The final value of all her shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students.
2. The smallest group then has \( x - 10 \) students.
3. The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + x + (x - 10) = 200
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3x - 10 = 200
   \]
5. Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   3x = 210
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 70

So, the smallest group has 60 students."
"First, let's find out how many cows and chickens Farmer Brown has.

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \) and the number of chickens is \( 2C \) (since there are twice as many chickens as cows).

The total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows and \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs.

The total number of legs from the cows is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} = 80 \text{ legs} \]

The total number of legs from the chickens is:
\[ 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} = 80 \text{ legs} \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 \text{ legs from cows} + 80 \text{ legs from chickens} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. He practices for 4 weeks, so he adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks.

So, the number of balls he can juggle after 4 weeks is:
3 (initial balls) + 1 (week 1) + 1 (week 2) + 1 (week 3) + 1 (week 4) = 7 balls

4. During the performance, he drops 3 balls.
5. Out of the 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 is lost.

So, the number of balls he loses is 1.

Therefore, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle on stage is:
7 (initial number of balls) - 1 (lost ball) = 6 balls

"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

Therefore, the final number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87."
"First, let's find out how many meters Tyson needs to run each day according to his coach.

Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. To find 1/5 of 5000 meters, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson needs to run 1000 meters more than his usual 5000 meters. Therefore, the total distance he needs to run each day is:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

To find the total distance Tyson runs in June, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

"First, let's find out how much each juice box costs.

Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
4 dollars + 5 dollars = 9 dollars for Juice Box B.

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
4 dollars + 7 dollars = 11 dollars for Juice Box C.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
11 dollars - 9 dollars = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the bag each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

The bag has 36 cookies in total. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the cookies taken by her son and husband from the total number of cookies:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's find out the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.

Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, it would be:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Now, let's calculate the discount. A 40% discount on $60 means:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{40}{100} \times 60 = 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \]

So, the discount is $24. Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's find out how much the factory used to make per day when they were selling tractors.

They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, the total amount made per day from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, let's find out how much they make per day now with silos.

They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, the total amount made per day from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more they are making per day now compared to when they were making tractors. The difference in the amount made per day is:
\[ \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find out what percentage more they are making, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Amount}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ pots} \]

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required:

\[ 30 \text{ (for daisies)} + 60 \text{ (for roses)} = 90 \text{ pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:

\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \text{ pots} \]

So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Andrea spent and gave away.
2. Subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the total amount Andrea spent and gave away:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the initial amount of money she had:
- Andrea initially had $36.

So, the amount she saved is:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's find out how much time John spent swimming. He spent half the time swimming as he did boating. Since he spent 6 hours boating, he spent:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours swimming} \]

Next, we calculate the total time he spent watching shows. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours watching shows} \]

Now, we add up the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:

\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time he spent on vacation as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30 \times T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 355 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The combined height of the shortest and second tree is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so:
17 feet × 2 = 34 feet

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"First, let's calculate how much Dean spent on the toy cars. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so:

6 toy cars * $2/toy car = $12

Next, let's calculate how much he spent on the teddy bears. He bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so:

5 teddy bears * $1/teddy bear = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount spent:

$12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, he has:

$28 - $17 = $11

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so:

$11 + $10 = $21

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person**: $5
2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides at $10 each)**: $10 x 2 = $20
3. **Arcade tokens for one person**: $5

So, the total cost for one person (Morgan or a friend) is:
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Morgan has a budget of $90. We need to find out how many people (including Morgan) can be covered by this budget.

Let's denote the number of friends Morgan can invite as \( x \). Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( x + 1 \).

The total cost for \( x + 1 \) people is:
\[ 30 \times (x + 1) \]

We set this equal to Morgan's budget:
\[ 30 \times (x + 1) = 90 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 30x + 30 = 90 \]
\[ 30x = 90 - 30 \]
\[ 30x = 60 \]
\[ x = \frac{60}{30} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

**Final Answer:**
Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"First, let's find out how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each.

So, the cost for lollipops each day is:
4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Now, Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. If she spends $1 on lollipops, the change she saves each day is:
$5 - $1 = $4

If she saves this amount for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:
$4/day * 5 days = $20

So, the final numerical answer is:
$20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.

2. **Determine how much money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - He had $10 initially.
   - Money left after buying gumballs = $10 - $2 = $8.

3. **Find out how much money Billy had before buying the candy:**
   - Billy took half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money he had before buying the gumballs.
   - Half of \( x \) is $2 (since he spent half on gumballs).
   - Therefore, \( x = 2 * 2 = $4 \).

4. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy had $4 before buying the candy.
   - He spent the rest of his money on candy.
   - Money spent on candy = $10 - $4 = $6.

5. **Determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount of candy bought = $6 / $1.5 per pound = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"To find out how old Carver's son is, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's say Carver's son is \( x \) years old.

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. So, we can write this as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

Carver's son is 25 years old."
"First, let's find the total distance the train travels between the three cities in one trip.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(100 + 75 - 50 = 125\) miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily distance of 900 miles:
\[18000 \div 900 = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
A chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.

To find the average, we add these two amounts and divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

For 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

**Final Answer: 23**"
"First, let's break down the trip into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Trip to the friend's house:**
   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles detour = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

2. **Return trip:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, we add the times for both parts of the trip:
- Total time = Time to friend's house + Time to return home = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

So, the total trip took **6 hours**."

Jane's score from the first test is 15 points.
Jane's score from the second test is 18 points.

First, we add these two scores together:
15 + 18 = 33 points

Now, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach at least 42 points:
42 - 33 = 9 points

So, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that four times the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5 equals the number of shoplifters. Since 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can find out how many were kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for the other reasons from the total:

\[ 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 18 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many points Erin has now. The question states that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

If Sara has 8 points, then three times Sara's points would be:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Erin now has 24 points. The question asks how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. To find this, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her current total:
\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before."
"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there's an additional 20% cost for etching.

The etching cost per frame is:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

So, the total cost per frame including etching is:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

For 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames and etching is:
\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the pins. Each pin costs $5, and 2 seniors will receive pins:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the cords. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so:
\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]
Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

"To find out how much Ethan would save and the total cost if he made his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of $400 and then subtract that from $400.

First, let's calculate 20% of $400:
20% of $400 = 0.20 × $400 = $80

Now, we subtract the savings from the original price:
$400 - $80 = $320

So, if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, the total cost would be $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of Friday, so:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

But 6 pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 100 \]"
"Hallie's dance practice hours are as follows:

- On Tuesdays, she practices for 1 hour.
- On Thursdays, she practices for 2 hours.
- On Saturdays, her practice is twice as long as Tuesday's, so that's 2 hours * 2 = 4 hours.

"First, we need to find out the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. The faulty pieces are 40% of the total $400,000.

To find 40% of $400,000, we do:
\[ 400,000 \times \frac{40}{100} = 400,000 \times 0.4 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000.

Next, we subtract the value of the faulty pieces from the total amount to find the value of the functioning pieces:
\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them produce 1 kg of milk, and the other half produce 2 kg of milk.

First, we find out how many sheep are in each half:
30 sheep / 2 = 15 sheep

So, 15 sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day, and the other 15 sheep produce 2 kg of milk each day.

Now, we calculate the total milk from each half:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Finally, we add the milk from both halves to get the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She fed 1 roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave out 6 rolls to her children. 

This leaves her with \(12 - 6 = 6\) rolls.

"First, we find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Next, we find out how many pupils are left after those who like blue are accounted for:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

Finally, to find out how many pupils like yellow, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

40 pupils - 20 pupils (blue) - 5 pupils (green) = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, the final numerical answer is:
15 pupils like yellow."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday by dividing the total money by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

Next, we know that on Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add up the number of apples picked over the three days:

\[ \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total number of apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days."
"First, let's figure out how many socks Lindsay has washed.

- Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair has 2 socks, she washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks from pairs.
- She also washed 15 loose socks.

So, the total number of socks Lindsay has washed is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

Lindsay started with 50 socks. If she has washed 35 socks, the number of socks she has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

**Lindsay has missed 15 socks.**"
"First, we need to find out how many cookies Rachel had after Janet gave her some. Rachel originally had 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 more. So, we add these two numbers together:

23 (Rachel's cookies) + 42 (Janet's cookies) = 65 cookies

Next, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Rachel's brother ate 44 of them. We subtract 44 from the total number of cookies:

65 (total cookies) - 44 (eaten by brother) = 21 cookies

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first need to calculate the total interest she will pay over the five months, and then add this to the principal amount. Finally, we divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment.

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   - Principal (P) = $3,650
   - Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
   - Time (T) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of a year, but since the rate is given as an annual rate, we can directly use 5 months for simplicity in this context)

   The formula for simple interest is:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = P \times R \times T
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 152.08
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount to be paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42
   \]

So, Karan has to pay \(\boxed{760.42}\) per month."
"First, let's calculate how far Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:

\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:

\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

"First, let's find out how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

Axel's total:
\[ 50 \text{ silver} + 80 \text{ gold} = 130 \text{ pesos} \]

"First, let's find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Millie will make from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate her profit. Her total cost for supplies is $18, so her profit is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups and sells 4 cups per hour, it takes her:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, her profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can follow these steps:

1. Let's say the total land Mr. Ruther had at first is \( x \) hectares.
2. He sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land is 12.8 hectares.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members:

- Number of boys = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26
- Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 52 * 0.5 = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are planning to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

- Girls who can't make it = 26 * 50% = 26 * 0.5 = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who are actually performing is:

- Girls performing = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add the teachers to the number of girls performing:

- Total people performing = Girls performing + Teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is:

- So, 8 pencils cost \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
36"
"First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we calculate:

Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 * 66 = 22 messages

Now, we add the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22
Total messages = 88

So, James delivers a total of 88 messages."
"First, let's calculate how much it costs for Dasha to buy tickets for all 9 rides.

Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, the cost for one ride is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \]

Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for David with the ride bracelet.

The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides. So, the total cost for David is:
\[ \$30 \]

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of buying tickets:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves:
\[ \$6 \]"
"First, we need to find out the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together, we get:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

2. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

3. The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Since the total is divided into 11 parts, each part is equal to 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles.

4. Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
5. Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

6. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost for both is reduced. 

The discount for each service is 20% of $10, which is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the discounted price for each service is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Since both Hulu and Disney Plus are discounted to $8 each, the total cost for both is:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the cost of the bundled Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim's original cable package cost $60 a month. By switching to the streaming services, he pays $26 a month. 

To find out how much money he saves, we subtract the cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package."
"First, let's find out how much time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time of writing, so \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours

Now, let's add up all the time she spent:

Total time = Time writing + Time recording + Time editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total time = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 20\% \]

Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"First, let's find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that can fit in the system. So, we need to calculate double the number of books and then add 20 to it:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ 92 \]

books to complete her task."
"First, let's find out how many cards Erica had initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

So, Erica had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards in total.

Next, let's see how many cards she gave away and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the final number of cards Erica has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She gave away 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

So, the final number of cards Erica has is \(50 - 29 + 17\).

Let's do the math:

\[50 - 29 = 21\]
\[21 + 17 = 38\]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's find out how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the final number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]"
"First, we need to find out how much more money Mark needs to buy the bike. The bike costs $300 and Mark has $50, so:

$300 - $50 = $250

Now, we know that Mark earns $10 each day. To find out how many days he needs to earn $250, we divide the total amount he needs by the amount he earns per day:

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days. 

The final answer is:
25 days"
"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 1/3 * 90 = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = (2 * 30) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add up all the bugs:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"First, let's find out Beth's age. Since Erica is 30 years old and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35

Now, let's find out Alice's age. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as follows:

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42

Now, to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."
"First, we need to find out how many ounces of milk John drank in total. Since one glass is 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we can calculate the total ounces as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we can calculate the total calories as follows:

\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's figure out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups × 4 = 12 cups

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup × 4 = 4 cups

Now, let's see how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

For flour:
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags
- 12 cups ÷ 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

For milk:
- Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles
- 4 cups ÷ 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

Finally, let's find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2
- Difference: 6 - 2 = 4

Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how much energy the air conditioner uses per day before Mel reduces the time.

Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and it uses 900 watts each hour. So, the total energy used per day is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 900 \text{ watts} = 7200 \text{ watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts} = 7.2 \text{ kW} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} - 5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The energy used per day after the reduction is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 900 \text{ watts} = 2700 \text{ watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \text{ watts} = 2.7 \text{ kW} \]

The energy saved per day is the difference between the original and the reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kW} - 2.7 \text{ kW} = 4.5 \text{ kW} \]

To find out how much energy is saved in 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kW} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 135 \text{ kW} \]"
"First, let's find out how many stripes each zebra has:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, for these two zebras, the total number of stripes is:
   \(17 + 17 = 34\)

2. The next zebra has 36 stripes.

3. The last zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. So, the number of stripes on this zebra is:
   \(36 \div 2 = 18\)

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. To do this, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. There are 4 zebras in total.

So, the average number of stripes is:
\(88 \div 4 = 22\)

Final numerical answer:
22"
"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make:

- \( \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \)

Each sandwich requires:
- 1 pound of meat
- 1 pound of cheese

So, for 5 sandwiches, he needs:
- \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \)
- \( 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \)

The cost of the meat and cheese is:
- Meat: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \)
- Cheese: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \)

So, the total cost is:
- \( \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \)

Therefore, Tyson would spend \$50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

**Final Answer: \$50.00**"
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan has initially. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 × Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 × 40
Number of corns = 80

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so we add that to the initial number of cannolis:

New number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + 60
New number of cannolis = 40 + 60
New number of cannolis = 100

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

Number of corns bought = 60 - 40
Number of corns bought = 20

Now, we add the corns he bought to the initial number of corns:

New number of corns = Initial number of corns + Number of corns bought
New number of corns = 80 + 20
New number of corns = 100

Finally, we find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Combined total = New number of cannolis + New number of corns
Combined total = 100 + 100
Combined total = 200

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps just for the school trip.

He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.

So far, he has done:
5,000 (school steps) + 1,000 (friend walk) = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he had already taken:
10,000 (total steps goal) - 2,000 (steps left) = 8,000 steps.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken from the total he had taken before his jog:
8,000 (steps before jog) - 6,000 (steps before friend walk) = 2,000 steps.

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2,000 steps."
"First, let's find out how many words are in the book. The book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page. So, the total number of words is:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby needs 30 minutes to read the book. He also needs 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time he needs is:

30 minutes (reading) + 10 minutes (travel) = 40 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. If he needs 40 minutes and he has 60 minutes, then he will be:

60 minutes - 40 minutes = 20 minutes early

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"First, let's calculate the total amount paid in May.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each earning $15 per hour for 40 hours a week.

So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 40 employees, the total weekly pay is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since May has about 4 weeks, the total pay for May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still $600. So, the total weekly pay for 30 employees is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since June also has about 4 weeks, the total pay for June is:
\[ 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 168000 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""

- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is half off, so it costs $3 divided by 2, which is $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashell bag and magnets:
- The seashell bag costs $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{3.00}\) dollars left."
"First, let's find out how much the second pack of fireworks costs. It's worth twice the first pack, so:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the first pack and the second pack:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount on these fireworks. The discount is 20%, so we find 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the first and second packs:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. 

For 30 days, she will eat:
2 cookies/night × 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies.

60 cookies ÷ 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the percentage of candles that will explode:**
   - Marcy guarantees that 99% of the candles will not explode. This means 1% of the candles will explode.
   - 1% of 50,000 candles = \( 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \) candles.

2. **Determine the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Since we are not given a specific number of more dangerous candles, we assume that the 5% applies to the total number of candles.
   - 5% of 50,000 candles = \( 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \) candles.

3. **Determine the overlap (candles that both smell like wet dog and explode):**
   - We need to find the overlap between the 500 candles that will explode and the 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog.
   - Since the problem does not specify any additional information about the overlap, we assume that the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the candles that will explode.
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the same as the number of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 2,500.

However, this assumption might be incorrect if the 5% of candles that smell like wet dog are not necessarily the same 5% that will explode. Given the problem's wording, we should consider the worst-case scenario where the 5% that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that will explode.

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
- 1% of 500 candles (since 5% of the candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% that will explode) = \( 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \) candles.

**Final Answer:**
5 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode."
"First, we need to find the discount price of each blouse. The blouses are 30% off, so we calculate 30% of $20.

30% of $20 = 0.30 × $20 = $6

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. So, the price of each blouse after the discount is:

$20 - $6 = $14

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:

4 × $14 = $56

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 \div 2 = 15\) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet.

Now, let's look at what Joanne's sister does:

- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(15 \times 3 = 45\) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up the equation to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \(x\).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister can be written as:
\[30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides of the equation:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.
- There are 180 heads in total, which means there are 180 camels and dromedaries combined.
- There are 304 bumps (humps) in total.

Let's denote:
- The number of camels as \( C \).
- The number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \) (since the total number of heads is 180)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, and the total number of humps is 304)

Now, we can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \):
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

Final answer:
56"
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ 3140 \text{ km} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
   - Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is 4 times the size of Peter's locker.
   - So, Zack's locker size = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is 2 times the size of Zack's locker.
   - So, Timothy's locker size = \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) cubic inches.

**Final Answer:**
Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting point of 10,000 feet. So, the comb is now at:
10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach where Stanley's comb is, Oliver must climb:
6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

So, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet."
"First, we need to find out how much money Mr. Josue got from the second bank. Since the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

So, the second bank gave him $8000.

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital Mr. Josue had:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ 17000 \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats taken away by boats**: Four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats.
   - Total cats taken away = \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
   - Remaining cats = \(50 - 20 = 30\)

3. **Cats that ran after a mouse**: 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.
   - Number of cats that ran = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\)
   - Remaining cats on the rock = \(30 - 18 = 12\)

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is **12**."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   - \(6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48\)

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   - \(8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96\)

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to make 24 months) at $14 a month:**
   - \(8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112\)

Now, we add all these amounts together:
- \( \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \)

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **\$256**."
"First, let's find out the cost of the jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the jogger jeans cost:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost of the jeans without the sale. Since Cole saved a total of $6, the total cost without the sale would be the sum of the sale prices plus the savings:

\[ 28 + 22 + 6 = 56 \]

Cole saved $6 in total, and he saved 1/3 of this from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the savings from the jogger jeans is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, so the original price of the jogger jeans was:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. So, the difference is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses:**
   - 4 buses, each holding 60 employees.
   - Total for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees.

2. **Minibusses:**
   - 6 minibusses, each holding 30 employees.
   - Total for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees.

3. **Minivans:**
   - 10 minivans, each holding 15 employees.
   - Total for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees.

Now, we add up all the capacities:
- Total capacity = \( 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \) employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's find out how much the soup cost. The soup cost 25% more than the bagel, which was $4.

To find 25% of $4:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup cost:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket and he ends up with $50 in spending cash. So, the total amount he gets from selling the cards is $100 (ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

2. Each card is sold for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total amount by the price per card: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards for himself. This means that the 100 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection because he kept 1/3 and sold the rest.

4. To find the total number of cards he started with, we need to calculate the full amount. If 100 cards are 2/3 of his total, then 1/3 would be 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cards.

5. Therefore, the total number of cards he started with is 50 (1/3) + 100 (2/3) = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"First, let's figure out how many hotdogs the caterer prepared. 

The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs. So, half of 36 is 18 guests. These 18 guests would each have 2 hotdogs, which means the caterer prepared \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs for these guests.

This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs in total for the initial 36 guests.

However, 40 guests showed up. The caterer had 36 hotdogs, and each of the 36 guests who were initially planned for could have 2 hotdogs, which uses up all 36 hotdogs. 

So, the 36 hotdogs were used up by the first 36 guests, and each of these guests had 2 hotdogs. This leaves no hotdogs for the additional 4 guests who showed up.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(40 - 36 = 4\).

Final numerical answer:

"First, we find half the number of letters in Indras' name:
6 letters / 2 = 3 letters

Next, we add 4 more letters to this number to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
3 letters + 4 letters = 7 letters

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to get the total:
6 letters + 7 letters = 13 letters

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13."
"First, let's add up the total cost of all the items Charlotte wanted to buy:

- The set of pot and pans cost $120.00
- The set of mixing bowls cost $20.00
- 5 separate utensils at $5.00 each would be 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

This is the total cost before the discount. Now, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 20%, so we need to find 20% of $165.00:

20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"First, let's add up the cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2
- Her mother gave her $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
More money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
More money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. We do this by dividing the total amount of gas by the number of containers:

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Now, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs. She needs 1/4 of a container:

3 gallons/container × 1/4 container = 3/4 gallon

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon:

3/4 gallon × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's find out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 1% of his money, and he had $5. 

1% of $5 is:
\[ \frac{1}{100} \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

So, George spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on the chips and candy bars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

**Final Answer:**

"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his friends.

Ray has four friends, and he shared the lollipops equally among them. So, each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces in total. She cuts it into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total.

Each piece would weigh:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces they have is:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, we need to find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, Sitti and Juris are sharing these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means the oranges will be shared among 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges

So, each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions cost $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

So, the cost per serving is:
\[ \$2.00 \]

Final answer:

"First, we need to find out how long it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. We know that Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's.

So, Bernadette's drive time is:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's 4-minute drive time.

So, Bernadette needs to leave:
\[ 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

Final answer:
\[ 9 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter formula is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads per pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Since Marcus bakes for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   The total cooling effect is:
   \[
   3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final temperature of the house is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's total time is:
\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know James's total time and his times for the swim and bike:
\[ 36 \text{ minutes (swim)} + 85 \text{ minutes (bike)} + \text{run time} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the run time for James is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} - 85 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run."
"First, let's find out how long Movie C is in minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

Now, Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH), we can calculate the distance as follows:

30 minutes is half an hour, so we need to find half of 32 miles:
\[ \frac{32}{2} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we need to find out how much 8 bails of hay cost. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"

Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"First, let's find out how much the salesman bought each sneaker for. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers} \]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:

\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of all the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, we add the two totals together to find the overall number of crayons:

48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

So, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"First, let's figure out the cost if you buy the super ticket and the extra popcorn with soda.

The super ticket costs $20, and the extra popcorn with soda costs $1, so the total cost with the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

Next, let's figure out the cost if you buy a regular movie ticket and a regular popcorn with a regular soda.

The regular movie ticket costs $12, the regular soda costs $3, and we need to find the regular price of the popcorn. Let's call the regular price of the popcorn \( P \).

So, the total cost without the super ticket is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. So, the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket:
\[ 15 + P = 21 + 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, each balloon cost $45 on the first day.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price of $65 each. We multiply the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, Bentley paid $11050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"First, let's figure out how many sapphires Jenna has left after trading. She starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them, so she has:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we need to calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \]

Jenna also gets 2 rubies in the trade. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \]

Now, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"First, let's find out how many apples Marin eats in 30 days. Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:

4 apples/day × 30 days = 120 apples

Now, let's calculate how many apples Nancy eats in 30 days. Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:

4 apples/day × 30 days = 120 apples

To find out how many apples they eat together in 30 days, we add Marin's apples to Nancy's apples:

120 apples + 120 apples = 240 apples

So, together, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days."
"First, we need to find out how much soil Bob needs in total. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. To find the volume of one raised bed, we multiply these dimensions:

\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one raised bed by 10:

\[ 32 \text{ cubic feet} \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil Bob needs. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. So, we divide the total volume of soil needed by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ 320 \text{ cubic feet} \div 2 \text{ cubic feet per bag} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost:

\[ 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate 60% of 15:

60% of 15 = 0.60 × 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Therefore, the number of green cards is:

15 (red cards) + 9 = 24 green cards

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards

Now, we add up all the cards:

15 (red) + 24 (green) + 39 (yellow) = 78 cards

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

**Final Answer: 45**"
"First, let's find out how many puppies have spots in total.

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.

So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
3 (from Jennifer's dog) + 4 (from Brandon's dog) = 7 puppies with spots.

Next, let's find out the total number of puppies.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.

So, the total number of puppies is:
8 (from Jennifer's dog) + 12 (from Brandon's dog) = 20 puppies.

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 0.35 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 35 \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:

2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

4500 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 2 trips

So, the farmer needs to make **2 trips** to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 cans a week.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, from cans, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents a week.

For the plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, from bottles, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents a week.

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total each week:
- From cans and bottles, she earns \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents a week.

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month:
- She earns \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents in a four-week month.

So, the final answer is:
84"
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

1. Calculate 60% of Frederick's plants: \(10 \times 0.60 = 6\).
2. Add this to Frederick's plants to find Toni's plants: \(10 + 6 = 16\).

So, Toni has 16 plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, we can calculate Shondra's plants as follows:

1. Subtract 7 from Toni's plants: \(16 - 7 = 9\).

So, Shondra has 9 plants.

"First, we need to find out what 1/5 of the $15 pizza delivery cost is. 

To do this, we divide $15 by 5:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

So, the tip Ashley wants to give is $3.

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Finley started in 1st place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible place, which is 5th place (since there are only 5 spots behind 1st).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(5 + 2 = 7\). So, she is now in 7th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(7 - 3 = 4\). So, she is now in 4th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(4 + 1 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 5th place."
"First, let's find out how many basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ 300 \div 10 = 30 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
20 apples * 45 cents = 900 cents

Since 100 cents = 1 dollar, we convert 900 cents to dollars:
900 cents ÷ 100 = $9

Becky received a $1 discount, so:
$9 - $1 = $8

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
20 apples * 50 cents = 1000 cents

Converting 1000 cents to dollars:
1000 cents ÷ 100 = $10

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on $10:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
$10 - $1 = $9

Now, we find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
$9 (Kelly) - $8 (Becky) = $1

Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

Final answer:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 towels.

Now, let's add up the laundry pieces per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforter: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, per room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

For 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces per room by 80:
15 * 80 = 1200

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's figure out how many shoes Fireman Frank has at each step:

1. **Starting Shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes.
   - Shoes after Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\)

3. **Wednesday**: He gains 15 new pairs of shoes.
   - Shoes after Wednesday: \(210 + (15 \times 2) = 210 + 30 = 240\)

4. **Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes.
   - Shoes after Friday: \(240 + (30 \times 2) = 240 + 60 = 300\)

5. **Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.
   - Shoes after Saturday: \(300 - 180 = 120\)

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since she has 6 jars of sprinkles and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes, we multiply 6 by 8:

6 jars × 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

48 cupcakes ÷ 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how much the piece of paper cost.

The pen cost $2. Three times the price of the pen is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

"First, let's find out how many pencils there were at the start of the year.

There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils left after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

So, the final number of pencils left is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. So, the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).
3. We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 3
   \]
5. Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks."
"First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches because the remoras' length is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches is of 120 inches. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the part is the length of the remoras (12 inches), and the whole is the length of the shark (120 inches):

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer:
10%"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that three-fourths (3/4) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
2. This means that one-fourth (1/4) of the students do not have a desktop computer at home.
3. We are told that 20 students do not have desktop computers. This represents the one-fourth (1/4) of the total number of students.

To find the total number of students, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \text{ of total students} = 20
\]

To find the total number of students, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
\text{Total students} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To find out how long Jason has to spend walking each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jason can walk in three weeks.
2. Divide the total minutes needed to break in the shoes by the total number of walking days.

First, let's find out how many days Jason can walk in three weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week and he walks 4 days a week, in three weeks he can walk:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day. He needs to walk a total of 240 minutes, and he has 12 days to do this. So, we divide the total minutes by the number of days:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things.

1. We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts.
2. However, 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts. If we just add 9 and 6, we would be counting those 3 kids twice.
3. So, the total number of kids allergic to at least one of these is \(9 + 6 - 3 = 12\).

Now, we know there are 32 kids in total. To find out how many are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one thing from the total number of kids:

\[32 - 12 = 20\]

So, 20 kids aren't allergic to anything."
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to get the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is:
\[ 621 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's 20% more expensive, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is:
\[ 1500 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they stay for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ 15400 \]"

So, together they earned:
$83 + $91 = $174

Now, they need to raise $200 in total. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract what they have already earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to determine how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs:

- Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
songs to his player.

- Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
songs to her player.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."
"First, we need to find out how many oranges Stetson ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked.

To find \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60, we do the following calculation:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Since Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats, we need to calculate the total amount of money he gave up:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"First, we need to find out how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we calculate:

3 times $80 = $240

$240 - $20 = $220

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"James runs 12 miles each day for 5 days a week. 

First, we find out how many miles he runs in a week:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find out how many hours he runs each week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs 6 hours a week.

6 hours/week"
"First, let's find out how much oats one horse eats in one day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total amount of oats all horses eat in one day is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much oats all the horses eat in five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

Sally spends $32 in all."
"First, let's figure out the cost of 2 packs of razors with the sale and coupon.

1. Normally, each pack costs $4.00.
2. With the ""buy one get one free"" sale, Heather only pays for 1 pack when she buys 2. So, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00.
3. She has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract $2.00 from the $4.00. This leaves her with $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, we need to find out how many razors she gets and the cost per razor.

4. Each pack has 4 razors, and she buys 2 packs, so she gets 4 * 2 = 8 razors.
5. The total cost after the discount is $2.00, and she gets 8 razors. So, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

6. $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

So, each individual razor will cost 25 cents."
"First, let's find the total height of the cheerleaders in inches.

9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall each, so:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, so:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

In the human pyramid, the heights of the cheerleaders on top will be added to the height of the ones below them. The pyramid structure is as follows:
- Bottom layer: 4 cheerleaders
- Second layer: 3 cheerleaders
- Third layer: 2 cheerleaders
- Top: 1 cheerleader (the shortest one, 60 inches tall)

Since the shortest girl is at the top, we assume the other cheerleaders are in the bottom layers. The total height of the pyramid is the height of the shortest girl at the top, which is 60 inches.

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ 60 \div 12 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Final answer:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. She works for 8 hours a day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:

200"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).
4. This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.
5. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42. So, \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela is currently 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He did this for 14 days.

So, the total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He did this for 14 days.

So, the total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. So, Brianne brought:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find out the total number of oranges they brought together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, we have:

\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) where the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides to isolate the terms with \( x \) on one side:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

Now, we know that together they collected 43 insects. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. Now we can find out how many David found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

And how many Lily found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found 16 insects.

**Final Answer: 16**"
"First, we need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah used. Since she used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein and there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate how many yards Mariah's grandma used. She used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein, so:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total amount of yarn used:

\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts for Cherrie's friends:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Now, let's add the 10 more random gifts that Cherrie decided to buy:

- Total gifts for friends: \(10 + 6 = 16\) gifts
- Additional gifts: 10 gifts

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:

- \(16 + 10 = 26\) gifts

**Final Answer: 26**"
"First, let's find the width of the rug. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide.

So, the width of the rug = width of the chair + 5 feet = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.

Twice the width of the rug = 2 × 8 feet = 16 feet.

So, the length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

The couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. She paid $7 in all.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To make the most popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the cheapest lumber. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and gives 200 sticks. The 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and gives 400 sticks. Since the 2 x 4 is cheaper, Frederick should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as he can with his $24.

First, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]
So, Frederick can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Each piece of 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks, so:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]
Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many legs all the dogs have together. Since Mario has 6 sled dogs and each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of dogs by the number of legs each dog has:

6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Since snowshoes are needed for each leg, Mario needs 24 pairs of snowshoes.

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair:

24 pairs * $12.00/pair = $288.00

So, the final cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $288.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of trips in a week is:
2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
10 trips * $2.20/trip = $22.00

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, we can find out how much she would save by subtracting the cost of the pass from the total cost of the trips:
$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, let's find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Adding these together, the total number of animals is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the farm and zoo have a combined total of 120 animals."
"To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, since Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought.

Rose bought:
- 12 onions
- 4 potatoes

So, Sophia bought:
- \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) onions
- \( \frac{4}{4} = 1 \) potato

Now, to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these numbers together:
- Total = 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes."
"First, let's find out how many days Andy has to lose the weight.

Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th. So, we need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

- From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July up to July 19th: 19 days

Now, let's add these up:
31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 190 days

Andy has 190 days to lose 30 pounds.

To lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
30 pounds × 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day:
105,000 calories ÷ 190 days = 552.63 calories per day

So, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit of about 553 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to find out how many kilometers Hannah will run. She runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km.

So, the total distance she runs is:
\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, we calculate the total amount of water she needs as:
\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \text{ ml} \]"
"Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. 

First, let's find out how much she spent on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 × $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, Julie had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.

25% of $400 = 0.25 × $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, Julie had:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into simple steps:

1. Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \).
2. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot (\( L \)), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, to find the cost of the house, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost $90,000."
"First, let's find out how much Tara spent on the canvas bags.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much she earned by selling the bags.

She sold each of the 40 bags for $8, so her total earnings are:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ 288 \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in the fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes in the fight. The fight has 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the length of each round:

\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches, we multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches per minute:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} \times 25 \text{ punches/minute} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{375} \]"

"First, let's find out how much money Ali has in total.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills, which is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Six $20 bills, which is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160\] dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. So, he gives:
\[\frac{160}{2} = 80\] dollars to his sister.

Now, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[160 - 80 = 80\] dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. So, the amount used for dinner is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\] dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:

They started with 200 loaves.

In the morning, they sold 93 loaves, so:
200 - 93 = 107 loaves left.

In the afternoon, they sold 39 more loaves, so:
107 - 39 = 68 loaves left.

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves left.

So, the bakers had 74 loaves of bread left."
"First, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide 36 by 6:

36 ÷ 6 = 6 rows of red tulips

Next, we find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide 24 by 8:

24 ÷ 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips

Now, we add the rows of red tulips and blue tulips together to find the total number of rows:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."
"First, we need to divide the 27 cups of raisins equally among the three items: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. 

So, we divide 27 by 3:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

This means Heather will use 9 cups of raisins for each item.

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we divide 9 by 3/4.

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:
\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how much Ada spends on electricity per day before adding the new device.

Ada's daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.

So, her daily cost before adding the new device is:
\[ 12 \text{ kilowatts} \times \$1.50 = \$18 \]

Now, let's calculate her daily cost after adding the new device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \text{ kilowatts} + 2 \text{ kilowatts} = 14 \text{ kilowatts} \]

The cost for her daily consumption after adding the new device is:
\[ 14 \text{ kilowatts} \times \$1.50 = \$21 \]

Next, we find the difference in her daily cost before and after adding the new device:
\[ \$21 - \$18 = \$3 \]

To find the difference in her weekly cost, we multiply the daily difference by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ \$3 \times 7 = \$21 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$21 \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then to paint a whole house, it would take:

\[ 5 \, \text{days} \times 2 = 10 \, \text{days} \]

So, one person can paint a whole house in 10 days.

Now, if 5 people are working together, they can paint the house 5 times faster than one person. So, the time it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{days}}{5} = 2 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \, \text{days} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 48 \, \text{hours} \]

Final numerical answer:
48"
"First, let's find out how many chairs Ophelia has. The problem states that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can find the number of chairs by adding 2 to the number of sofas.

Number of chairs Ophelia has = 20 (sofas) + 2 = 22 chairs

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we multiply the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3 to find out how many chairs Jenna has.

Number of chairs Jenna has = 22 (Ophelia's chairs) × 3 = 66 chairs

Now, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which is 66 chairs. The problem does not specify the number of sofas Jenna has, but it tells us that they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has.

Number of sofas Jenna has = 66 (chairs) - 2 = 64 sofas

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have together.

Total number of sofas = 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84 sofas

Total number of chairs = 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88 chairs

Finally, we add the total number of sofas and chairs together.

Total number of sofas and chairs = 84 (sofas) + 88 (chairs) = 172

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"First, we need to find out how much the headphone set costs. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. So, we can find the cost of the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount paid.

Total amount paid: $48
Cost of CD: $4

Cost of headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of CD
Cost of headphone set = $48 - $4
Cost of headphone set = $44

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $48. We need to find out how many CDs he could buy with that amount. Each CD costs $4.

Number of CDs = Total amount without headphone set / Cost of CD
Number of CDs = $48 / $4
Number of CDs = 12

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

12 (total CDs he could buy) - 1 (CD he originally bought) = 11

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
11"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. For 6 weeks, Josh worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
   \(4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}\)

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
   \(5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}\)

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this 1 week is:
   \(6 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add all these hours together to get the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\(24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}\)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
4. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. Since 21 people got off, 3 times fewer means:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   So, 7 people get on the bus. The number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]"
"First, let's find out how old Jame is now. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then he is currently:

27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be:

22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Now, we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years will be:

2 * 30 = 60.

And 5 years younger than that will be:

60 - 5 = 55 years old.

This is how old Jame's cousin will be in 8 years. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years:

55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, the years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"The computer cost $1,100.

Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so the printer cost:
$1,100 - $400 = $700

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost for the 2 monitors and the printer together is:
$2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

This $600 is the total cost for 2 monitors. So, the cost for one monitor is:
$600 ÷ 2 = $300

So, one monitor cost $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, each girl brought 60 (from the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) seashells.

Let's calculate that:

Each girl brought:
60 + 4 * 60
= 60 + 240
= 300 seashells.

So, each girl brought 300 seashells."
"First, we need to find out how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can add those 5 candies back to the 3 he has now to find out how many he started with.

So, George originally had:
3 (candies left) + 5 (candies eaten) = 8 candies

Now, since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, we multiply George's original amount by 2 to find out how many Nick had.

Nick had:
8 (George's original candies) × 2 = 16 candies

So, Nick has 16 candies."
"Chenny is 10 years old.

Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is:
10 - 4 = 6 years old.

Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is:
6 + 2 = 8 years old.

So, Anne is 8 years old."
"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"First, let's add up the vlogs Emma made in the first three weeks:

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Now, let's add these numbers together:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma needs to make 72 vlogs in total for the month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total she needs:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

**18**"
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find out the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the question asks how much you ended up paying, the final answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"First, let's find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys.

$18 ÷ 3 = $6

So, each boy gets $6.

The eldest boy starts with $6. He then adds $5 to his share:

$6 + $5 = $11

The following day, he adds another $10:

$11 + $10 = $21

He then spends $8:

$21 - $8 = $13

After spending $8, he triples the amount he has left:

$13 × 3 = $39

So, the final amount he has is $39."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Savings Target**: Elvis wants to save $1125 in April.

2. **Number of Days in April**: April has 30 days.

3. **First Half of April**: The first half of April has 15 days.

4. **Second Half of April**: The second half of April also has 15 days.

5. **Savings Plan**: Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.

Let's say Elvis saves $x each day in the first half of April. Then, in the second half, he will save $2x each day.

6. **Total Savings Calculation**:
   - Savings in the first half: \(15 \times x\)
   - Savings in the second half: \(15 \times 2x = 30x\)

7. **Total Savings Equation**:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

8. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. 

9. **Savings in the Second Half**:
   Since he saves twice as much in the second half, he saves:
   \[
   2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

**Final Answer**: Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

For the apples:
3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50

For the oranges:
5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00

For the peaches:
6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20.00. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$7.00"
"First, let's find out how much Jairus gets for 20 tasks. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, so for 20 tasks, he gets:

\[ 20 \times 0.8 = 16 \]

Next, let's find out how much Jenny gets for 20 tasks. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, so for 20 tasks, she gets:

\[ 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny."
"To solve this, let's use simple math. Let's say Brad gets \( x \) dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets \( 4x \) dollars.

Together, they have 100 dollars, so:
\[ x + 4x = 100 \]
\[ 5x = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much \( x \) is, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day. So, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, which is a total of 6 miles each day.

"Elise writes the full alphabet twice and then half of it once. The alphabet has 26 letters.

- Writing the full alphabet twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters
- Writing half of it once: \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters

Now, she re-writes everything she has already written, which means she writes the 52 letters again.

So, the total number of letters she has written is:

- First writing: \(52\) letters
- Rewriting what she has already written: \(52\) letters

Adding these together:

\(52 + 52 = 104\)

**Final Answer: 104**"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Round**: Ali calls 3 families.
2. **Second Round**: Each of those 3 families calls 3 more families. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. **Third Round**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 more families. So, \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. **Fourth Round**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 more families. So, \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

So, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."
"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add back the weight he lost to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. So, the total weight he lost is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

His final weight was 70 pounds. To find his initial weight, we add the weight he lost to his final weight:
70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"First, we need to find out how many toys are in a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys.

So, five times larger than James's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have 400 toys. Let's call the number of toys Jonathan currently has \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Daniel gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount:

\[10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00\]

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

17"
"First, we calculate the commission for the first $1000 of sales. 

For the first $1000, the commission is 30%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, we calculate the commission for the sales over $1000. Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]

For the sales over $1000, the commission is 10%. So, we calculate:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts of commission together to find the total commission earned:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, the amount of money Antonella earned is:
\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"First, let's find out how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, we multiply 2 by 24:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

Next, we need to find out how many bottles Bill wants to have in total for his guests. He has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest. So, we multiply 70 by 2:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, we need to find out how many more bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he wants:

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day. On a cold day, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. On a hot day, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day.

Twice the time it takes on a cold day is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, adding 2 minutes to that:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, on a hot day, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for 3 miles on each day.

On a cold day for 3 miles:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a hot day for 3 miles:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes on a hot day than on a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's find out how much money John earns in a day. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so:

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost for lunch:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \]"
"First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. We know there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes. So, we subtract 7 from 21:

21 - 7 = 14

This means 14 buttons had four holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes:

- The 7 buttons with 2 holes each have a total of \(7 \times 2 = 14\) holes.
- The 14 buttons with 4 holes each have a total of \(14 \times 4 = 56\) holes.

Adding these together gives us the total number of holes:

14 (from the two-holed buttons) + 56 (from the four-holed buttons) = 70

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"First, let's find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we divide Timothy's locker size by 2:

Timothy's locker size = 24 cubic inches
Zack's locker size = 24 ÷ 2 = 12 cubic inches

Next, we find out how big Peter's locker is. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we divide Zack's locker size by 4:

Peter's locker size = 12 ÷ 4 = 3 cubic inches

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's find out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommendation is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that. So, Octavia drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks. So, Juan drinks:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from what he currently drinks:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and then divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight ÷ Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds ÷ 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves 5 degrees straight upward every hour.

3. **Time Passed**: The sun moves for 10 hours.

4. **Total Movement of Sun**: Since the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, in 10 hours, it will move \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.

5. **Final Angle**: The final angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the total movement of the sun. So, \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

**Final Answer**: 82 degrees"
"First, let's find out how old James's second son is. If the first son is 12 and the second son is 4 years younger, then the second son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, let's find out the total number of candles needed. James needs candles for both sons, so we add their ages together:

12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's figure out how many pages Judy read in the first week.

Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so in the first week, she read for:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{1.5} \text{ pages/minute} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total pages read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 105 \times \frac{4}{3} = 105 \times 1.3333 = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ 240 \]"
"First, let's find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, let's add the sandwiches that Cody and Trevor ate to find out how many sandwiches were eaten in total:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Since they started with 12 sandwiches, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

So, the final number of sandwiches left is:

5"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old.
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be \(44 + 7 = 51\) years old.
3. At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \(x\), then we can write the equation: \(51 = 3x\).
4. To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3: \(x = \frac{51}{3} = 17\).
5. This means that in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. Therefore, the nephew's current age is \(17 - 7 = 10\).

So, the nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."

1. For the first tooth, Sharon got $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, Sharon got $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, she got \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, Sharon got half the amount of the previous three teeth. Since the previous three teeth gave her $1.00 each, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, she got \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount of money Sharon received is \(5 + 3 + 1 = 9\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
9 dollars."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored:
80 - 20 = 60 goals

Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored:
80 - 45 = 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals

Final numerical answer:
175 goals"
"First, let's find out how much money Mitchell made. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, we multiply 21 by $4:

21 × $4 = $84

Now, we know Liam made $63. To find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:

$84 - $63 = $21

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam."
"First, let's figure out how much Peter spends each day. He has $70 to spend over 7 days, so he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. There are 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. He has 4 days left, so he can spend:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

But he only has $30 left, so he can buy:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 23 \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Spaying cost: $200
2. Vaccines cost: 3 vaccines * $20 each = $60
3. Cost of broken vases: 4 vases * $12 each = $48

Now, let's add them all up:

$200 (spaying) + $60 (vaccines) + $48 (vases) = $308

So, the total cost so far is $308."
"First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to all the flower shops in one week.

The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, in one week, Ford supplies:
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. So, the number of roses he lacks to supply all the flower shops in one week is:
65 - 40 = 25 roses

Now, let's find out how many roses he lacks in a month. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford lacks in a month is:
25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account in 2 years.
2. Subtract this amount from her initial savings.

First, let's find out how much money Katina removes each month and then for 2 years.

- Katina removes $100 every month.
- There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) months.

Now, we calculate the total amount removed in 2 years:
\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many loaves of bread they need to make 10 sandwiches. Since each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf for 10 sandwiches.

The cost of the bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

The cost of different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ \text{Cost of bread} + \text{Cost of cheeses and condiments} = \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00, so for 10 sandwiches, the revenue is:
\[ 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

Now, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is:
\[ \$37.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many crayons Kate has in total. She has 3 boxes of 64 crayons each.

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins she can make. Since she uses 8 small pieces of crayon for each muffin:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, if she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total amount of money she can make is:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, Kate can make $36."
"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is found by multiplying the length by the width.

Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet

Now, let's calculate the cost for each part of the carpet replacement:

1. **Cost of the new carpet and padding:**
   - Carpet cost: $12 per square foot
   - Padding cost: $2 per square foot
   - Total cost per square foot for carpet and padding: $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot

2. **Cost for the contractor to remove the old carpet:**
   - Removal cost: $4 per square foot
   - Total removal cost: 216 square feet * $4 = $864

3. **Cost for the contractor to install the new carpet:**
   - Installation cost: $34 per square foot
   - Total installation cost: 216 square feet * $34 = $7344

4. **Total cost for carpet and padding:**
   - Total cost for carpet and padding: 216 square feet * $14 = $3024

Finally, we add all the costs together to find the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet:

- Total cost = Cost of carpet and padding + Removal cost + Installation cost
- Total cost = $3024 + $864 + $7344 = $11232

So, the final cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $11232."
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the total number of birds Mack saw over the week.
2. Divide the total number of birds by the number of days (which is 7).

First, let's add up the birds:

- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Now, let's sum these numbers:

50 (Day 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 300 birds

Next, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

300 birds ÷ 7 days = 42.857142857142854 birds per day

Rounded to the nearest whole number, Mack saw an average of 43 birds per day.

Final numerical answer:
43"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to it. Half of 20 is 10. So, 20 + 10 = 30.
3. She then divides this result by 5. So, 30 ÷ 5 = 6.
4. Next, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 - 12 = 8. Now, 6 × 8 = 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards. 

Final numerical answer: 7"
"First, let's find out by what percentage Maggie's oven is off. 

The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:
468 - 450 = 18

To find the percentage, we divide this difference by the set temperature and then multiply by 100:
(18 / 450) * 100 = 4%

Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, so it reaches 520 degrees when it's 4% off.

Let's call the temperature Maggie needs to set her oven to ""x"". When the oven is 4% off, it will be 96% of the set temperature (100% - 4% = 96%).

So, 96% of x should be 520 degrees:
0.96 * x = 520

To find x, we divide both sides by 0.96:
x = 520 / 0.96
x = 541.67

So, Maggie should set her oven to 541.67 degrees. 

Final numerical answer:
541.67"
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of both movies together.

First, let's convert the time of each movie into minutes:

- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes long.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes long.

Now, we add the lengths of both movies together:

\[90 + 125 = 215\]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

215"
"First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000 and then subtract that from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

So, Juan's house is:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129200 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many cups and dishes Judy brought.

Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so she brought 12 cups.

She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she brought:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, let's determine how many cups and dishes her friend brought.

Her friend brought 40 cups.

Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

Finally, the total number of utensils (cups + dishes) brought by both is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 68 \text{ dishes} = 120 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:
120"
"First, let's find out the cost of one box of contacts with the discount. 

The original price of one box is $100.00, and it's 10% off. So, the discount is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the price after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, Pete buys 2 boxes, so the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. So, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Now, to find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, each contact will cost:
\[ 1.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
So, Jill worked a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
So, John worked a total of \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each person earned.

Tabitha pays $10 per hour.

Jill earned:
- \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30\)

John earned:
- \(7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70\)

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
- \(\$70 - \$30 = \$40\)

So, John earned \$40 more than Jill."
"First, let's find out how many calories Hannah burns in total.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, for every 200 calories, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water. So, we need to find out how much water she needs for 1600 calories.

1600 calories / 200 calories = 8

For 8 sets of 200 calories, she needs:
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than blue jelly beans, so it's \( B - 0.01B = 0.99B \).
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so it's \( B + 0.01B = 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Final answer:
30"

1. Starting speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After another increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

To find the average, we add the three numbers together and then divide by 3.

So, the sum is: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Now, we divide the sum by 3 to get the average: 156 ÷ 3 = 52

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \( 8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \)

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email and their friends:

- Alex invited 100 people via email.
- Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.

So, the total number of people invited by email and their friends is:
\[ 100 \text{ (initial invites)} + (100 \times 2) \text{ (friends)} = 100 + 200 = 300 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people Alex invited by calling her friends and their spouses:

- Alex called 10 friends.
- 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.

So, the total number of people Alex invited by calling her friends and their spouses is:
\[ 10 \text{ (friends)} + 8 \text{ (spouses)} = 18 \]

Now, we add the two groups together to find the total number of people who will be at the event:
\[ 300 \text{ (from email invites and friends)} + 18 \text{ (from calling friends and their spouses)} = 318 \]

Therefore, Alex will need:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on Amazon.com:
- The boots cost $16.
- The shipping costs $4.
So, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's 2 * $4 = $8.
So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- The total cost on eBay is $21.
- The total cost on Amazon is $20.
So, $21 - $20 = $1.

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."

"First, let's find out how much protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms.

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, 200 grams would have twice as much protein because 200 is double 100.

So, 200 grams of mushrooms would have:
\[ 3 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Now, if John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( x \) years.
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( x - 5 \) years.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x = 2 \times (x - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = x - 10
   \]
   Add 10 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

5. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for the porcelain crown, which is $500. So, we add this to the total:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already paid a deposit of $600, so we subtract this from the total cost:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900. He makes $15 per hour, so we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ 3900 \div 15 = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's say the smallest angle is \(x\) degrees.

The next angle is twice the smallest, so it is \(2x\) degrees.

The last angle is three times the smallest, so it is \(3x\) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can write the equation:

\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:

\[x = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The largest angle, which is three times the smallest, is:

\[3 \times 30 = 90\]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"First, let's find out how much money Colby has in total.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add all the amounts together to find the total amount of money Colby has:

\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer: 69**"
"To find the total number of legs the pets have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Now, we add up all the legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"First, we need to find out what 50% of the 8-pound weight is. 

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as:
\[ 8 \times \frac{50}{100} = 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, when Jamaal increases the weight by 50%, the new weight is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. So, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \]"

4. **Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
   - \(4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}\)
5. **Christmas Gifts**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years.
   - \(5 \text{ games/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ games}\)

Now, let's add all these together:

- Initial games: 5
- First year: 12
- Second year: 24
- Third year: 48
- Christmas gifts: 15

Total number of games:
\[ 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104 \]

So, after 3 years, Steve has **104 games**."
"First, we need to find out how many miles the plane travels in one hour. We do this by dividing the total miles by the total hours:

1200 miles ÷ 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how many hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this rate. We do this by dividing the additional miles by the speed:

2000 miles ÷ 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

Final answer:
5 hours"
"First, let's find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

120 ÷ 2 = 60 pounds per hour

Now, Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz does. So we calculate 3/4 of 60:

3/4 × 60 = 45 pounds per hour

Now, let's calculate how much they make together in one hour:

Ruiz's hourly production + Marissa's hourly production = Total hourly production
60 + 45 = 105 pounds per hour

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, we multiply the total hourly production by 12:

105 × 12 = 1260 pounds

So, together they made 1260 pounds of chocolates in 12 hours."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Howard spends $8.
2. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so he spends \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:
- Monday: $8
- Tuesday: $16
- Wednesday: $64

Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

Howard originally had $100. So, the money he has left is:
$100 - $88 = $12

Final answer:
$12"
"First, let's calculate how much money Patrick earned in the first four hours.

Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = \$7.50 \]

Since he did this for four hours, his earnings for the first four hours are:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50 \text{ per hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next two hours.

Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, in one hour, he earned:
\[ 10 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = \$6.00 \]

Since he did this for two hours, his earnings for the next two hours are:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00 \text{ per hour} = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total amount of money Patrick earned:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$42.00 \]"
"First, let's find out how many rotations one tire undergoes in a month.

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, we need to find out how many 2-mile segments are in 400 miles:

\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/segment}} = 200 \text{ segments} \]

Since each segment causes 725 rotations:

\[ 200 \text{ segments} \times 725 \text{ rotations/segment} = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tire to undergo 10,440,000 rotations:

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations/month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years.

**6 years**"
"First, we need to find out how many washings one pump of shampoo gives. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, we divide 120 by 2 to find the number of washings per pump:

120 washings ÷ 2 pumps = 60 washings per pump

Now, we need to find out the cost per washing. The bottle costs $24.00, and it gives 120 washings:

$24.00 ÷ 120 washings = $0.20 per washing

Since we want to know the cost per pump, and we know that one pump gives 60 washings, we can find the cost per pump by multiplying the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

$0.20 per washing × 60 washings per pump = $12.00 per pump

To convert this to cents, we remember that $1.00 is 100 cents, so:

$12.00 × 100 cents = 1200 cents

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents.

1200 cents"
"First, let's find out the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt costs $25 and there's a 30% discount on it. To find the discount amount:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there's no discount mentioned for them, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $52.50, which is more than what Joe has, he can't buy both. However, if we assume he can only buy one item, let's calculate the money left for each case.

If he buys the shirt:
\[ 50 - 17.50 = 32.50 \]

If he buys the shorts:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Since the question does not specify which item he buys, we can only provide the amount left if he buys the shirt, as it's within his budget.

So, the money Joe will have left after buying the shirt is:
\[ 32.50 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. He plans to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days.

So, \(4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}\).

Now, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, to find out how many pounds of butter he needs for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 by \(\frac{1}{4}\).

So, \(28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7\).

Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants.

**Final Answer: 7 pounds**"
"First, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter. So, we multiply 150 by 194:

150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter. So, we multiply 490 by 194:

490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street."
"First, let's figure out how much time John's research took in total. He initially planned for 5 months, but it ended up taking 10 times that long. So, the total time is:

\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the first 5 months. The initial funding was $100,000 for the first 5 months. So, the cost for the first 5 months is:

\[ \$100,000 \]

For the remaining 45 months (since 50 months total minus the first 5 months), the cost per month increased by 50%. So, the cost per month for these months is:

\[ \$100,000 \times 1.5 = \$150,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months:

\[ 45 \text{ months} \times \$150,000 = \$6,750,000 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months to get the total cost of the research:

\[ \$100,000 + \$6,750,000 = \$6,850,000 \]

So, the total cost of John's research is:

\[ \$6,850,000 \]"
"Let's break it down:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add up the ounces of meat:

- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total ounces of meat consumed: \(6 + 8 + 16 = 30\) ounces.

So, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts 3 times a day, and there are 1000 members.

So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"First, let's find out how many gallons of water Gary uses in a week for laundry. Since he does laundry twice a week and each load uses 20 gallons, we can calculate the weekly water usage as follows:

\[ 20 \text{ gallons/load} \times 2 \text{ loads/week} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of water he uses in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the water. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost for the year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

So, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - Total for rocks: \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\)
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - Total for coral: \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\)
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - Total for fish: \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\)
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, let's add all these amounts together:

\[
10.00 \text{ (aquarium)} + 5.00 \text{ (rocks)} + 6.00 \text{ (coral)} + 10.00 \text{ (fish)} + 2.00 \text{ (fish food)} = 33.00

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's find out how much meat Prince sells in a day. He sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day. So, in a day, he sells:

15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

Now, we have a bull that weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat he sells in a day:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

5 days"
"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row.

Total seats = 4 rows × 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by them.

Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats ÷ 4 = 18 seats

Now, we find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats.

Seats left = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats ÷ 3 = 18 seats

Now, we find out how many seats were left for the students.

Seats for students = 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"First, let's find out the total number of street lights.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, at one intersection, the number of street lights is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ lights} = 76 \text{ lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"
"To find out how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then add them together.

First DVD:
- Can be played 1000 times before breaking.
- Has been played 356 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 356 = 644 times.

Second DVD:
- Can be played 1000 times before breaking.
- Has been played 135 times.
- Remaining play times = 1000 - 135 = 865 times.

Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs:
- Total remaining play times = 644 + 865 = 1509 times.

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"First, let's find out how many hours John spent in physical therapy each week. Since he went twice each week for 2 hours, that means he spent:

2 hours/session × 2 sessions/week = 4 hours/week

Now, since he went for 6 weeks, the total number of hours he spent in therapy is:

4 hours/week × 6 weeks = 24 hours

The cost per hour for the sessions is $125, so the total cost for 24 hours is:

24 hours × $125/hour = $3000

So, the physical therapy cost John $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Gum Pack**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**:
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours.
   - So, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum during the school day.

3. **Gum Chewing After School and After Dinner**:
   - He chews 1 piece on the way home.
   - He chews 1 piece after dinner.
   - So, he chews \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) pieces of gum after school and after dinner.

4. **Total Gum Chewed**:
   - Total pieces of gum chewed = pieces chewed at school + pieces chewed after school and after dinner.
   - Total pieces of gum chewed = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \).

5. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Initial pieces of gum - total pieces chewed = \( 20 - 6 = 14 \).

6. **Giving Half to Sister**:
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.
   - Half of 14 pieces = \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \).

7. **Gum Remaining After Giving to Sister**:
   - Remaining pieces of gum = \( 14 - 7 = 7 \).

So, at the end of the day, Jim has **7 pieces of gum left**."

"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:

$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find out the total number of flowers Arianna planted. She has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed."
"First, let's understand the conversion:

1. Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second.
2. We need to convert this to Mb per hour.

Step 1: Convert kb to Mb.
1 Mb = 1000 kb
So, 20 kb = 20 / 1000 Mb = 0.02 Mb

Step 2: Calculate the speed in Mb per second.
Ashley's speed is 0.02 Mb per second.

Step 3: Convert the speed to Mb per hour.
There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
So, Ashley's speed in Mb per hour = 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour

Step 4: Calculate the final speed.
0.02 * 3600 = 72 Mb per hour

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for three days, it pulled:

10 cars/day × 3 days = 30 cars

On each of the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the first three days. So, each of those days it pulled:

10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars

For the remaining four days, it pulled:

6 cars/day × 4 days = 24 cars

To find the total number of cars it towed that week, we add the cars from the first three days to the cars from the last four days:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars it towed that week is 54."
"First, we need to make sure we are using the same units. There are 12 inches in a foot. The roller coaster requires 4 feet, which is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Adam is currently 40 inches tall. To find out how much more he needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches a year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the total inches he needs to grow by the number of inches he grows each year:

\[ 8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam needs 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"First, let's find out how much the company paid to acquire the cars. Since each car cost $25,000 and James sold 10 cars, the total cost to acquire the cars is:

\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid for these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car, so:

\[ 30\% \times \$25,000 = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total amount the company paid for the cars is:

\[ 10 \times \$7,500 = \$75,000 \]

Now, let's find out the total selling price of the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total selling price is:

\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The profit is the total selling price minus the total cost to acquire the cars:

\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. So, his commission is:

\[ 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final amount James made is:

\[ \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate 25% of 100 riders:

25% of 100 = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. We calculate 40% of 25:

40% of 25 = 0.40 × 25 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10.

Final answer:
10"
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Since a diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we can find the total price for all three jewels by adding the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels together:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add all the stamps together:
16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

1. First, we find the difference in their speeds:
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Difference: 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

2. This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

3. Now, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap:
   - Distance to cover: 75 miles
   - Rate of closing the gap: 15 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Rate = 75 / 15 = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"First, let's find out how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught by subtracting 6 from 17.

So, Darren caught \(17 - 6 = 11\) fish.

Now, Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, Tommy caught \(11 + 3 = 14\) fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's find out the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost is $60 for 10 classes.

To find the cost per class, we divide the total cost by the number of classes:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

So, each class costs $6.

Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes.

The cost per class if he misses \( x \) classes is:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]

So, \( x \leq 4 \).

This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ customers daily} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each of them processes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

For Jewel:
\[ 50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week} \]

For Julie:
\[ 100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week} \]

Now, we add the weekly totals to find the combined total for both Julie and Jewel:
\[ 350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

So, the total weekly production for the two is:

"Paisley ran 4 miles.

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if Reggie ran 20 miles, Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Lynn ran 17 miles."
"First, let's find the cost of one apple and one orange.

For apples:
- 4 apples cost $5.20
- So, 1 apple costs $5.20 ÷ 4 = $1.30

For oranges:
- 3 oranges cost $3.30
- So, 1 orange costs $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10

Now, let's find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

For 5 apples:
- 5 apples cost 5 × $1.30 = $6.50

For 5 oranges:
- 5 oranges cost 5 × $1.10 = $5.50

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:
- $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of earth Bob needs to dig out. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the hole.

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:
6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet = 72 cubic feet

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, we need to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet.

72 cubic feet × 3 seconds per cubic foot = 216 seconds

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so:
   \[
   \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so:
   \[
   2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

1. Calculate 5% of $20,000:
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 20000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 20000 = 1000
   \]

2. Add this raise to his original salary:
   \[
   20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

So, his new monthly salary is $21,000.

Next, let's calculate the bonus he gets, which is half a month's salary.

3. Calculate half of his new monthly salary:
   \[
   \frac{21000}{2} = 10500
   \]

Now, let's find out his total monthly earnings including the bonus.

4. Add the bonus to his new monthly salary:
   \[
   21000 + 10500 = 31500
   \]

So, his total monthly earnings are $31,500.

Finally, let's calculate his annual earnings.

5. Multiply his total monthly earnings by 12 (months in a year):
   \[
   31500 \times 12 = 378000
   \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
- Since a suit costs $750, each dress pant costs \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits.
- So, he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
- The total cost for the suits is $7500.
- The total cost for the dress pants is $1500.
- The total cost for the dress shirts is $1800.
- So, the total cost for everything is \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

"First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since she is 4 years older than Steve, and Steve is 60 years old, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ 60 + 4 = 64 \]

So, Steve's wife is 64 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Steve's son is. The problem states that their son is currently half as old as his mom. Since his mom is 64 years old, we can calculate his age as follows:

\[ \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

So, Steve's son is 32 years old.

Finally, we need to find out how old Steve's son's wife is. The problem states that she is 3 years younger than her husband. Since her husband is 32 years old, we can calculate her age as follows:

\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time Alisa biked: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time Stanley biked: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, the total number of miles Alisa and Stanley biked is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil:

- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.

So, the time to dig through the soil is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay:

- Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he digs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet per hour through clay.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.

So, the time to dig through the clay is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."

"First, let's calculate the cost for Clara on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$20 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so:
\[ \$400 - \$2 = \$398 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Sheila on Wednesday.

The price on Wednesday was $30 per pomegranate, so for 20 pomegranates:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30 \text{ per pomegranate} = \$600 \]

She got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid on the two days:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \$142 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the amount she earned from green hats. So, the sales from green hats would be:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne made $800 from green hats and $400 from red hats, which totals:

\[ 800 + 400 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, we calculate 3/4 of $1200:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we add the sales from the first month and the second month to find the total amount she made in two months:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second and third hours each cost twice as much as the first hour, so they cost $15 * 2 = $30 each.

Now, let's add up the cost:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $30

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30 = $75

So, James paid $75."

"First, let's find out how many deviled egg halves Lori needs. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, then:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 halves:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, to find out how many dozens of eggs she needs, we divide the number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs."
"Shiela has to write 15 pages in total. She has finished 1/3 of the paper.

First, we calculate 1/3 of 15 pages:
1/3 of 15 = 15 ÷ 3 = 5 pages

So, Shiela has written 5 pages.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
15 - 5 = 10 pages

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Cost of the plane**: $150,000
2. **Monthly hanger rental**: $5000
3. **Monthly fuel cost**: Twice the hanger rental, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:

- **Total monthly cost**: $5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

Next, we calculate the total cost for the first year:

- **Total yearly maintenance cost**: $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:

- **Total cost for the first year**: $150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (maintenance) = $330,000

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's find out how long it took to cook the pork. Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, it took:

30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes (pork)

Next, we need to find the combined cooking time for pork and rice:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes

Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, the cooking time for beans is:

80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes

Now, to find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes

So, it took 120 minutes to cook all the food.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

For almonds:
- 1 pound of almonds costs $10.
- So, 1/2 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = $5 \).

For walnuts:
- 1 pound of walnuts costs $15.
- So, 1/3 pound of walnuts costs \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = $5 \).

Total cost for the first mixture:
- $5 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

For almonds:
- 1/5 pound of almonds costs \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = $2 \).

For walnuts:
- 1/3 pound of walnuts costs $5 (as calculated before).

Total cost for the second mixture:
- $2 (almonds) + $5 (walnuts) = $7.

Finally, to find out how much more the first mixture costs than the second mixture:
- $10 (first mixture) - $7 (second mixture) = $3.

"To solve this problem, let's use the information given:

1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal legs is 70.
4. The total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add up the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, we divide the total money by 3:

"To find out how many books Sally has, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's say Sally has \( x \) books. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, we can write this as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2x + 3 \]

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2x + 3 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2x \]
\[ 18 = 2x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = x \]
\[ 9 = x \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can calculate the current height in inches as follows:

20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches

The bamboo needs to grow to a height of 600 inches. So, we need to find out how much more it needs to grow:

600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth rate:

360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so now there are \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs.
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys (one for each of the 8 new dogs).

2. **After Buying the First Batch of Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - There are twice as many more dogs than when he left, so there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs now.
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

3. **After Buying the Second Batch of Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave, so there are \(24 - 3 = 21\) dogs left.
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- James initially needed 8 toys.
- Then he needed 12 more toys.
- So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**
20"
"First, let's find out how much Dylan invested. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount, which is $1200.

Dylan's investment = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480 \)

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
$1200 - $480 = $720

Next, Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.

Frances's investment = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480 \)

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount for Skyler is:
$720 - $480 = $240

So, Skyler's investment is $240."
"To find out how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we add the number of signatures Carol and Jennifer currently have:
   Carol's signatures: 20
   Jennifer's signatures: 44
   Total signatures so far: 20 + 44 = 64

2. Next, we subtract the total number of signatures they currently have from their goal of 100 signatures:
   Goal: 100
   Current total: 64
   Signatures needed: 100 - 64 = 36

So, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"First, let's find out how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Karen earns in one day. If she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this, we first find out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

Now, if one potato makes 6 hash browns, then 96 potatoes will make:

\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, we need to find out the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs 80 kg, so 8 adults weigh:
80 kg/adult * 8 adults = 640 kg

Jack's weight is also 80 kg, so the total weight is:
640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg

The elevator can hold a maximum of 700 kg. So, the amount by which they have exceeded the maximum load is:
720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

They have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can say:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can say:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 61 \]

Now, let's find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can say:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 \]
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 96 \]

Finally, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 298 \]

So, they have 298 cookies in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. So, the extension is \( 0.5x \) cm.
3. She also adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom of the dress.
4. The final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim, which is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this, let's first find out how long it takes Chris to mow the whole lawn in each mode.

- In ""turtle"" mode, it takes 1 hour to mow the whole lawn. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, it takes 60 minutes to mow the whole lawn in ""turtle"" mode.
- In ""rabbit"" mode, it takes 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn.

Now, Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

- Mowing half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode would take half of 60 minutes, which is 30 minutes.
- Mowing the other half in ""rabbit"" mode would take half of 40 minutes, which is 20 minutes.

To find the total time, we add the time taken for each half:

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"First, we need to add the time it takes John and Jack to walk to the corner and then to the fire station. 

It takes them 6 minutes to the corner and 13 minutes to the fire station. So, we add these times together:

6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. To find out how much time they have left, we subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have:

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- Apples: 1 kilo for $4
- Bananas: 2 kilos for $2 per kilo, so \(2 \times 2 = $4\)
- Oranges: 2 kilos for $3 per kilo, so \(2 \times 3 = $6\)

Now, let's add up the total cost:

\(4 + 4 + 6 = $14\)

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, Celinda baked:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda to find the total number of cookies:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, if Greta and Celinda ate 10 of the cookies, we subtract those from the total to find out how many are left:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ 80 \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the age of the younger triplet is \( x \).
2. Then the age of the older twin would be \( x + 7 \).
3. The other two triplets would be the same age as the younger one, so their ages are also \( x \).

So, the combined ages of the four children would be:
\[ (x + 7) + x + x + x = 44 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 3x = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 3x = 37 \]
\[ x = \frac{37}{3} \]
\[ x = 12.33 \]

Since we are dealing with ages, and typically ages are whole numbers, we need to check if there was a misinterpretation. However, based on the given problem and the steps, the age of the younger triplet is 12, and the age of the older twin is:
\[ 12 + 7 = 19 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is:
19"
"First, let's add up the time John needs for his homework:

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert this to minutes:

3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John needs for homework from the total time he has:

180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

**100 minutes**"
"First, let's find out how much the candies cost. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

This means each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we know each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is $12.00."
"First, let's find out how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each of them has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, in 10 years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding the coins saved by Rong and Neil together, we get:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines.

So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. The heartworm check is part of the total bill, so we can write:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.60x \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.60x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we'll isolate \( x \) on one side:
\[ x - 0.60x = 40 \]
\[ 0.40x = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.40} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, John leaves with:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find out the cost of each type of fruit:

- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so a banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1\).
- An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs \(3 \times 1 = $3\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:

- For bananas: \(5 \text{ bananas} \times $1 = $5\).
- For apples: \(12 \text{ apples} \times $0.5 = $6\).
- For oranges: \(7 \text{ oranges} \times $3 = $21\).

Finally, let's add up the costs to find the total price for the crate:

- Total price = \( $5 + $6 + $21 = $32 \).

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares:
- Red: 14
- Blue: 18
- Green: 24
- White: 12

Total number of squares = \(14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\)

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

**Final Answer: 68 square feet**"
"First, let's find out how many regular chairs the restaurant has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Chairs to get} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

50 deer * 50% = 50 deer * 0.50 = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

25 bucks * 20% = 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks.

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's find out how many points each student has collected.

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of 50 and add it to 50:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we subtract 30 from 65:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, we multiply Tom's points by 3:
   \[
   3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. So, we subtract the points they have from the total needed:
\[
400 - 255 = 145

The class is missing \boxed{145} points to go on the trip."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren). So, 3 children × 3 grandchildren each = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies). So, 9 grandchildren × 3 great-grandbabies each = 27 great-grandbabies.

So, the final number of great-grandbabies is 27. 

27"
"First, we calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into it.

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for this.

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."
"First, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box. Since the box can hold 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, we subtract 4 from 20:

20 - 4 = 16 pencils

Now, to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box, we divide the number of pencils by 2 because a pair consists of 2 pencils:

16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box."
"First, let's find out how many fireworks are in the 15 boxes that the city is setting off. Each box contains 20 fireworks, so:

\[ 15 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ fireworks/box} = 300 \text{ fireworks} \]

Hannah's house is at an angle to see 40% of these fireworks. So, we calculate 40% of 300:

\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \text{ fireworks} \]

Next, Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, we calculate the total number of fireworks she will set off:

\[ 3 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ fireworks/box} = 15 \text{ fireworks} \]

Now, we add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:

\[ 120 \text{ fireworks} + 15 \text{ fireworks} = 135 \text{ fireworks} \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ 135 \]"
"First, let's find out how many people are going to the cinema. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and then they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:

13 (Aiden and his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20 people

Each person gets to save a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. So, for drinks, we have:

20 people * 2 drinks/person = 40 drinks

And for snacks, we have:

20 people * 3 snacks/person = 60 snacks

Each drink and each snack cost $2. So, the total cost for drinks is:

40 drinks * $2/drink = $80

And the total cost for snacks is:

60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together gives us the total amount spent:

$80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200

So, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks."
"First, let's find out how much Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we add 800 pounds to 4,000 pounds.

So, Gordy's truck can haul:
4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that when Gissela, Gordy, and Gary's trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds. We already know how much Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul, so we can find out how much Gary's truck can haul by subtracting the amounts of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total.

So, Gary's truck can haul:
11,600 pounds - 4,000 pounds (Gissela's truck) - 4,800 pounds (Gordy's truck) = 2,800 pounds

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to find out how much money Gerald and Julia each got when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 ÷ 5 = $20.

So, Gerald got 3 parts, which is 3 × $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.

**$50**"
"First, let's find out how fast Martha's turtle can crawl. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat can run 15 feet/second.

So, if the cat is 5 times faster, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5
Turtle's speed = 3 feet/second

Now, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds
Distance = 120 feet

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"First, we need to find out how much more money the firefighters need to raise to reach their goal. They need to raise $6300 in total and have already raised $2100. So, we subtract $2100 from $6300:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

This means they need to raise $4200 more. We know that in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. To find out how much they raise per hour, we divide $2100 by 3:

$2100 ÷ 3 = $700

So, they raise $700 per hour. Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide $4200 by $700:

$4200 ÷ $700 = 6

This means they need to raise money for 6 more hours. Since they have already raised money for 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

3 + 6 = 9

So, they need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.

Final answer: 9"
"First, let's find out what percent of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes by the city.

1. The city uses 40% of the river's water.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.

To find out how much is used for industrial purposes, we calculate 80% of 40%:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]
This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Now, to find the non-industrial use, we subtract the industrial use from the total city use:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Final numerical answer:
8%"
"First, we need to find out how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would have:

\[ 7 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total charge for 14 days of tutoring, given that Alex charges $12 per day. So, we multiply the number of days by the daily charge:

\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168 \]

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"First, let's find out how much chocolate ice cream is made in one hour. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so in one hour, it makes:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \]

Next, let's find out how much vanilla ice cream is made in one hour. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so in one hour, it makes:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \]

Now, let's calculate how much chocolate ice cream is made in 48 hours:

\[ 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \]

And how much vanilla ice cream is made in 48 hours:

\[ 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \]

Finally, let's add the amounts of both types of ice cream to find the total:

\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:
$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount:
10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total:
$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"First, let's figure out how many scoops Erin can get with her $6.00.

The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

So, for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops.

The cost for 2 scoops is:
\[ 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. With $6.00, she can buy 2 scoops twice (since each set of 3 scoops costs $3.00).

So, she can get:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

But remember, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 free, making it 3 scoops total. She can do this twice with her $6.00.

Therefore, Erin should buy:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

And she will get 2 free scoops (1 for each set of 2 bought).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's find out how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

A week has 7 days, so two weeks have \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Now, let's see how much candy each has left after 14 days.

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:

\(58 - 44 = 14\)

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

**Final Answer: 14**"
"First, we need to find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square feet bathroom. 

To find two thirds of 36, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, he would need:
\[ 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for James when he picks the blueberries himself.

1. The initial cost to go picking is $20.
2. The cost per pound is $1.5, and he picked 30 pounds. So, the cost for the blueberries is \( 30 \times 1.5 = 45 \) dollars.
3. Adding the initial cost to the cost of the blueberries, the total cost is \( 20 + 45 = 65 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost if he had bought the blueberries at the store.

1. The cost per pound at the store is $2.5, and he picked 30 pounds. So, the cost would be \( 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much he saved by picking the blueberries himself.

1. The cost of buying the blueberries at the store is $75.
2. The cost of picking the blueberries himself is $65.
3. The savings is \( 75 - 65 = 10 \) dollars.

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself."
"First, we need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. 

To find 10% of $700, we do:
\[ 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the increase in price is $70. Therefore, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out how much the company paid for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each. We do this by multiplying the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg is 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- John uses 2 oz of cheese.
- Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

Now, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
- Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Finally, let's add up all the calories:
- Total calories = calories from eggs + calories from cheese + calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 calories + 240 calories + 80 calories = 770 calories.

The final numerical answer is:
770 calories."
"First, let's find out how much the pencils cost in total. Since one pencil costs $0.50, 6 pencils would cost:

\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the erasers. Since one eraser costs $0.25, 8 erasers would cost:

\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total cost:

\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

If you paid $10 for the pencils and erasers, the change you would get back is:

\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"First, we find out how many people receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

"First, we need to find out how many sacks of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother in total. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, we add these together:

3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

Now, we know that each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice. To find out how many kilograms of rice she gave away, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight of each sack:

7 sacks × 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, Goldy gave 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother."
"This week, Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, the total number of boxes she bought this week is:

3 (Coco Crunch) + 5 (Fruit Loops) = 8 boxes

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

8 (this week) - 4 (last week) = 4 boxes

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes with her feet when her arms are not raised. She taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute with her arms not raised is:

\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms not raised, the total number of taps in those 3 minutes is:

\[ 550 \times 3 = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised. With her arms raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute, so the total number of taps per minute is:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps in those 2 minutes is:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both periods to get the total number of taps in 5 minutes:

\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost if the city council fixes it and the total cost if Ron fixes it himself, then compare the two.

1. **Cost if the city council fixes it:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - If the city council fixes it, Ron doesn't have to pay for the damage.
   - So, the cost is $0.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes it himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost if Ron fixes it himself is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.

3. **Savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost if the city council fixes it and the cost if Ron fixes it himself.
   - So, the savings is \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to find out how many normal chairs are left after some were sent for repair. There were originally 170 normal chairs, and 20 were sent for repair. So, we subtract 20 from 170:

170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.

Next, we need to find out how many baby chairs are left after some were sent for repair. There were originally 23 baby chairs, and 13 were sent for repair. So, we subtract 13 from 23:

23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together to find the total number of chairs left:

150 (normal chairs left) + 10 (baby chairs left) = 160 chairs left.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's figure out how many slices each person ate and how many were left.

Bryce and his two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices:
- \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 12 slices is \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) slices.

So, Bryce and each of his two friends ate 8 slices. That's 3 people eating 8 slices each:
- Total slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So:
- \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 12 slices is \( 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9 \) slices.

So, each of the two remaining friends ate 9 slices. That's 2 people eating 9 slices each:
- Total slices eaten by the two remaining friends: \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten:
- Total slices eaten: \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

Since there are 5 pizzas and each pizza has 12 slices:
- Total slices from 5 pizzas: \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) slices.

Finally, to find out how many slices are left:
- Slices left: \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

So, the final number of slices left is:

"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the cat's time. So, we calculate 2/3 of 30 minutes:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the 9 sausages.

Now, to find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we add the times together and divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 8 feet is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches:
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, this length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is:
\[ \boxed{10} \] inches."
"First, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashes from the students' cars.

There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's find out how many windows Hannah smashes from the teachers' cars.

There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes 3/4ths of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows smashed from both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

So, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"First, let's find out how many spools of thread Candy has in total:

- Light blue: 15 spools

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate twice Dora's age first:

Twice Dora's age = 2 × 15 = 30

Now, we add 8 to this to find her father's age:

Father's age = 30 + 8 = 38

Next, we find out Dora's mother's age. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34

Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:

"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we subtract 23 from the number of apples Boris has:

Boris has 100 apples.
Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, we need to update the number of apples each has:

Boris now has \(100 - 10 = 90\) apples.
Beck now has \(77 + 10 = 87\) apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

"First, let's find out the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar.

Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Cost of 10-gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

Total amount of money spent = Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars
Total amount of money spent = $50 + $48
Total amount of money spent = $98

So, the total amount of money she spent is $98."

"First, we need to find out how many students are in each class. Since there are 80 students in total and the students are equally divided between two classes, we divide 80 by 2:

80 ÷ 2 = 40

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find 40% of 40, we multiply 40 by 40% (or 0.40):

40 × 0.40 = 16

So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

For the second amusement park:
- Cost for adults: $14 per adult
- Cost for children: $10 per child

Total cost for 2 adults:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

Total cost for 2 children:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Total cost for the second amusement park:
\[ 28 + 20 = 48 \]

Now, let's find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first.

Savings:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

So, they will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first."
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.4 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- So, the daily savings are $0.1 * 500 = $50.

Next, let's find the weekly savings:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

Carl's marbles = 4 × Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 × 56
Carl's marbles = 224

Next, let's find out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can calculate Cal's marbles as follows:

Cal's marbles = 2 × Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 × 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Combined marbles = 224 + 112
Combined marbles = 336

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined."
"First, we need to find out how many students are in each of the six groups. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:

54 students ÷ 6 groups = 9 students per group

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups if each group has 9 students:

9 students per group × 12 groups = 108 students

Now, we need to find out how many more students are needed to form these 12 groups:

108 students - 54 students = 54 more students

Since we need 54 more students to form 12 groups, and each group needs 9 students, we can find out how many more groups are needed by dividing the additional students by the number of students per group:

54 more students ÷ 9 students per group = 6 more groups

So, the final answer is:
6 more groups"
"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekend:**
   - There are 2 days in a weekend.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekends is \(2 \times 100 = 200\) chairs.

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in one week:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one week is \(300 + 200 = 500\) chairs.

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:**
   - There are 8 weeks in two 4-week months.
   - So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(8 \times 500 = 4000\) chairs.

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   - Half of 48 is \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \).
   - So, Gunther is left with \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas.

3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   - Gunther now has \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.

4. Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   - Gunther is left with \( 49 - 12 = 37 \) bananas.

5. On the third day, Gunther adds another 6 bananas:
   - Gunther now has \( 37 + 6 = 43 \) bananas.

So, the final number of bananas Gunther finds in the pile is:
43

Therefore, the final answer is:

"First, we need to find out how much each roommate pays per month for electricity. Since the total electricity bill is $100 and there are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates), we divide $100 by 5.

$100 ÷ 5 = $20 per month for each person.

Now, to find out how much each person pays per year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

$20 × 12 = $240 per year for each person.

So, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity."
"First, let's find out how many glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, he sent \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- He also sent 4 dozen plates, so he sent \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we need to find out how many glasses and plates were broken:

- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amount:

- Glasses left: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
- Plates left: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"First, let's figure out how many small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

\[ 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \]

So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons from this trade.

Next, let's determine how many large stickers she trades for large buttons. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them:

\[ 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \]

So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

Now, let's calculate how many large stickers she has left after these trades:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Since she has 20 large stickers left and each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, she can trade these 20 large stickers for 20 small buttons.

Now, let's sum up all the buttons she has:

- From trading small stickers: 27 large buttons
- From trading large stickers: 20 large buttons + 20 small buttons

So, the total number of buttons she has is:

\[ 27 + 20 + 20 = 67 \]

Final answer:
\[ 67 \]"

"To solve this problem, let's use simple math.

1. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \).
2. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).
3. The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \).
4. We know the total number of votes is 33, so \( 3x = 33 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3: \( x = 33 ÷ 3 = 11 \).
6. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), so it is \( 2 × 11 = 22 \).

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts**: 11 students need XS shirts.
2. **Small (S) shirts**: Twice as many students need S shirts as XS shirts. So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need S shirts.
3. **Medium (M) shirts**: Four less than the number of S shirts need M shirts. So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need M shirts.
4. **Large (L) shirts**: Half as many students need L shirts as M shirts. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need L shirts.
5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts**: Six more students need XL shirts than L shirts. So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need XL shirts.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:
- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

"First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The discount is 5% of $140.

To find 5% of $140, we can multiply $140 by 5% (or 0.05 in decimal form):

$140 × 0.05 = $7

So, the discount is $7.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price:

$140 - $7 = $133

You will pay $133 after the discount."
"First, we need to find out how many songs John has in total from his 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply 300 by 20:

300 songs/playlist × 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. To find out the total hours of music, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

6000 songs × 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

"First, let's find out how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, so:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, let's add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles.
2. The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases of shingles.

Now, we know the total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So we can write the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \):

\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs the same amount as the second house, which is 100 cases.

"First, we need to find out how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 45% of 200
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 * 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Now, we add the number of bananas and pears to find the total number of fruits:

Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

So, George has 490 fruits."
"First, we need to find out how much money Marissa had left after buying the ball. She had $80 and the ball cost $20. So, we subtract the cost of the ball from the total money she had:

"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra will have read:

300 (already read) + 150 (more to read) = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can find out how many books Ahmed read by dividing the number of books Ezra read by 2:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Now, to find out how many books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra will have read to the number of books Ahmed read:

450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books

So, they have read 600 books altogether."
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches for 5 hours and earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches for 2 hours and earns $15 per hour.
- So, for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not get the additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are \(30\) dollars.

Now, let's add her earnings from both days:

- Her total earnings for Monday and Wednesday are \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. So, the total money from eggplants is:
20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He already has $60 from the eggplants. So, the amount he still needs to make from selling the corn is:
$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make from the corn by the number of ears of corn:
$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3"
"First, let's find out how much time Tatiana has in total for her weekend:
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours

Total time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

Next, we know she reads for 3 hours. So, the remaining time is:
12 - 3 = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining 9 hours:
1/3 of 9 hours = 9 / 3 = 3 hours

So, the time left for soccer is:
9 - 3 = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."

"First, let's find out how fast they hiked. They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of their driving speed (50 miles per hour) is 25 miles per hour. So, they hiked at 25 miles per hour minus 5 miles per hour, which is 20 miles per hour.

Now, we know they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour. To find out how far they hiked, we multiply their hiking speed by the time they spent hiking:
20 miles/hour * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Next, we need to find out how long they drove. The total time spent traveling (driving and hiking) is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking. So, the time spent driving is:
6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours.

Now, we calculate the distance they drove. They drove at 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance is:
50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 225 miles.

Finally, we add the distance they hiked to the distance they drove to find the total distance to their vacation spot:
225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 255 miles."
"Let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the information given:

1. **Enemies Jumped On:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.

   - If Emma jumps on \(E\) enemies, then Ava jumps on \(E + 8\) enemies.
   - Points from enemies for Emma = \(10E\).
   - Points from enemies for Ava = \(10(E + 8) = 10E + 80\).

2. **Berries Collected:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - Points for each berry = 5 points.
   - If Emma collects \(B\) berries, then Ava collects \(B + 3\) berries.
   - Points from berries for Emma = \(5B\).
   - Points from berries for Ava = \(5(B + 3) = 5B + 15\).

3. **Time Left on the Timer:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - Points for each second left = 30 points.
   - If Emma has \(T\) seconds left, then Ava has \(T + 4\) seconds left.
   - Points from time for Emma = \(30T\).
   - Points from time for Ava = \(30(T + 4) = 30T + 120\).

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both:

  \text{Ava's Score} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T + 120 = 10E + 5B + 30T + 215
  \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[
\text{Ava's Score} - \text{Emma's Score} = (10E + 5B + 30T + 215) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = 215
\]

So, the difference between their two scores is **215**."
"First, we need to find out how much the two remaining pizzas cost in total. The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars. So, we subtract the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost:

64 - 30 = 34 dollars

This means the remaining two pizzas cost 34 dollars in total. Since both of these pizzas cost the same amount, we divide 34 by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

34 ÷ 2 = 17 dollars

So, each of the other two pizzas cost 17 dollars.

Final numerical answer:
17 dollars"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. So, for those 5 days, they ride:
3 rides/day × 5 days = 15 rides

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual time, which means:
3 rides/day × 2 = 6 rides/day

So for those 2 days, they ride:
6 rides/day × 2 days = 12 rides

Now, we add the rides from the 5 days and the 2 days together:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

27"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
3. After adding these 17 fish, the total number of fish in the pond became \(7 + 17 = 24\).
4. Let's say he bought \(x\) white fish and \(17 - x\) orange fish.
5. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish became \(3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x\).
6. The number of white fish became \(4 + x\).
7. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   20 - x = 2(4 + x)
   \]
8. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   20 - x = 8 + 2x
   \]
9. Combine like terms:
   \[
   20 - 8 = 2x + x
   \]
   \[
   12 = 3x
   \]
10. Solve for \(x\):
    \[
    x = \frac{12}{3} = 4
    \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's figure out how many miles Andy drives to work in a week.

Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home each day. So, each day he drives:
\[ 5 \text{ miles (to work)} + 5 \text{ miles (back home)} = 10 \text{ miles per day} \]

From Monday to Friday, he drives:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles per week} \]

Now, we know Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon. So, to find out how many gallons of gas he uses per week, we divide the total miles driven by the fuel efficiency:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons per week} \]

The price of gas is $3 per gallon. So, the cost of gas Andy uses per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received:

- Carrie received ten twenties, which is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 0.25 dollars, the total from the quarters is \(140 \times 0.25 = 35\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she received is \(200 + 35 = 235\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate how much she spent:

- She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties. So, the amount spent from the twenties is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120\) dollars.
- She spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars.

So, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is \(120 + 35 = 155\) dollars.

Final answer:
155"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 142 \]"
"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell sold, we first need to figure out how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold.

1. **Smart TVs**: One-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs. So, we calculate one-fourth of 40:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 smart TVs were sold.

2. **Analog TVs**: One-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs. So, we calculate one-eighth of 40:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 analog TVs were sold.

3. **OLED TVs**: The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
   \]
   So, 25 OLED TVs were sold.

**Final Answer:**

"First, we need to find out how much the school will contribute. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we divide the total cost by 2:

$300 ÷ 2 = $150

This means the school will contribute $150. Now, we need to find out how much more money John needs. We know John has $50, so we subtract this from the total cost of the trip:

$300 - $50 = $250

But since the school is contributing $150, we need to subtract that from the amount John still needs:

$250 - $150 = $100

So, John is missing $100."
"First, we need to find out the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we need to find out how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

The temperature needs to go up from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, which is a difference of:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is:

20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.

4 logs"
"First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are 3/5 of the total number of groups. We calculate 3/5 of 10:

(3/5) × 10 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we need to find out how many seashells all these groups brought back together. We do this by multiplying the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

6 × 2 = 12 seashells

So, the final answer is:

12 seashells"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
   Now there are 125 people on the train.
3. Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
   Now there are 138 people on the train.
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]
   Now there are 100 people on the train.

So, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bottle caps Damien finds each day.
2. Calculate the value of the bottle caps he finds each day.
3. Multiply the daily value by the number of days in the month.

Step 1: Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day.

Step 2: Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, the value of the bottle caps he finds each day is:
\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day} \]

Step 3: To find out how much money he makes in a 30-day month, we multiply the daily value by 30:
\[ \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$75.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much Jamie earns for her regular 8 hours of work each day. She earns $20 per hour, so for 8 hours, she earns:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

On Tuesday, Jamie worked 11 hours. The first 8 hours are at her regular rate, so she earns $160 for those. For the additional 3 hours (since 11 - 8 = 3), she is paid at a special rate which is 150% of her regular hourly rate. 

To find the special hourly rate, we calculate 150% of $20:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, for the 3 additional hours, she earns:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money she earned for the first 8 hours to the money she earned for the additional 3 hours:

\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"The zookeeper counted 12 female lions. There are half as many male lions as female lions, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 male lions. There are also 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and cubs together:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to find out how much the jeans cost after the 25% discount.

The discount amount is 25% of $40. To find 25% of $40, we can calculate:
\[ 25\% \times 40 = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The sale price of the jeans is $30. If Mike pays with a $50 bill, we need to find out how much change he will get back:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:

"First, let's figure out how many new employees are hired in three months. Since the company hires 20 new employees every month, in three months, they will hire:

20 employees/month × 3 months = 60 new employees

Now, the company's initial workforce is 200 employees. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees becomes:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees each month is:

260 employees × $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Since we need to find out the total amount paid after three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3:

$1,040,000/month × 3 months = $3,120,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"First, we need to find out how long the choir will sing ""Deck the Halls"". Since they will sing it twice and each time it is 150 seconds long, we multiply 150 by 2:

150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

Next, we need to add the time for ""Jingle Bells"". ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, and they will sing it once, so we just add 240 seconds to the time for ""Deck the Halls"":

300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"First, let's figure out Billy's hourly wage at different times:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage increased by $0.50:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage increased by $1.00:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's find out Sally's starting hourly wage:
- Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally for 20 hours of work:

- **Billy's earnings:** $11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230.
- **Sally's earnings:** $10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210.

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
428"
"First, let's find out how many students there are in total. There are 40 classes with 25 students in each class. So, the total number of students is:

40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Each student plants 1 tree, so the students will plant a total of 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 3 teachers per class, and there are 40 classes. So, the total number of teachers is:

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:

1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

So, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Now, let's add them up:

3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's say the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total, so we can write the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

To find \( x \), we need to get all the \( x \) terms on one side:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"First, let's find out how many students passed in each grade.

For third graders:
340 out of 500 passed.

For fourth graders:
40 out of 100 passed.

For fifth graders:
The pass rate for fourth graders was 40 out of 100, which is 40%.
Twice this rate for fifth graders would be 80%.
So, 80% of 400 fifth graders passed.
80% of 400 is \(400 \times 0.80 = 320\).

Now, let's add up the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total number of students:
500 (third graders) + 100 (fourth graders) + 400 (fifth graders) = 1000 students.

Total number of students who passed:
340 (third graders) + 40 (fourth graders) + 320 (fifth graders) = 680 students.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Overall pass rate:
\(\frac{680}{1000} \times 100 = 68\%\).

The school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag holds 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply 72 by 2:

72 chips/bag × 2 bags = 144 chips

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

144 chips ÷ 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we need to divide the total square inches by the height in inches:

12 square inches ÷ 3 inches = 4 inches

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's find out how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so:
4 students * 1.5 quarts/student = 6 quarts

16 students each drank 2 quarts, so:
16 students * 2 quarts/student = 32 quarts

Now, let's add the tea that the students drank:
6 quarts + 32 quarts = 38 quarts

There are 10 quarts left, so at the beginning of the party, there were:
38 quarts (drunk) + 10 quarts (left) = 48 quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we divide the total quarts by 4 to find the gallons:
48 quarts / 4 quarts/gallon = 12 gallons

So, at the beginning of the party, there were 12 gallons of tea.

12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies. 

So, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has now:
- He started with 100 candies.
- He sold 150 candies, but since he had only 100, he needed to order more to meet the demand.
- He ordered 100 more candies.

Now, let's see how many candies he has in total:
- He had 100 candies initially.
- He sold 100 of those, leaving him with 0.
- Then he ordered 100 more, so he now has 100 candies.

He sold 150 candies in total, but he only had 100 initially and then got 100 more, making it 200 candies in total.

To find out how many more he needs to sell:
- He sold 150 out of the 200 he has.
- So, 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies."
"Let's calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

- **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

- Number of students at the beginning of the year: 10

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used to make the S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows used:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Now, we subtract the 21 marshmallows used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows in the bag:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 marshmallows left. Since John and DeSean are sharing these equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"First, let's figure out how long each person can play:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
- One friend can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many games each person can play in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):

- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) games
- Each of the two friends: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) games
- The better friend: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) games

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarters used:

- Jack uses \(12 \times 1 = 12\) quarters.
- Each of the two friends uses \(24 \times 1 = 24\) quarters, so for two friends, it's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
- The better friend uses \(8 \times 1 = 8\) quarters.

Adding these up, the total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
68"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the amount of citrus zest used is \( x \) ounces.
2. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( x \) ounces.
3. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2x \) ounces.
4. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2x \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) ounces.

Now, we need to find the total amount of all the ingredients and set it equal to 10 ounces, since that's the total amount of the salt scrub.

The total amount of the ingredients is:
\[ x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10x \]

We know the total is 10 ounces, so:
\[ 10x = 10 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil, which is \( 4x \):
\[ 4x = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil used is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each, so the goats cost:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

He also buys 2 cows for $1500 each, so the cows cost:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

To find out how much money John spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent $4500."
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes in total.

He already has:
- 8 chocolate cupcakes
- 40 toffee cupcakes

So, the total number of cupcakes he already has is:
8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:
63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate 20% of 40:

\[ 40 \times \frac{20}{100} = 40 \times 0.2 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with 40 cars, subtract the 8 cars he sold, and then subtract the 16 cars he gave away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with:

\[ 16 \text{ cars} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money the students raised. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Now, we need to divide this amount equally among the 20 students. So, we divide $125,000 by 20:

$125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total time she walked in the two days, we add the hours together:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours to minutes:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars came, so the total became:

50 cars + 20 cars = 70 cars

When he went out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, half of 70 cars left:

70 cars / 2 = 35 cars

This means 35 cars were left in the parking lot during the lunch break.

The total number of cars he counted during the lunch break is 35."
"First, let's find out how much John makes in a day. 

John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, for each cycle, he makes:
\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Since he does 30 cycles a day, his daily earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week (7 days), we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \$1260.00 in a full 7-day week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. So, Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Now, we need to find the total points Sasha scored during both games. We add the points from the first game and the second game:

\[14 + 4 = 18\]

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins/package} = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins/package} = 36 \text{ tins} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 \text{ tins} - 36 \text{ tins} = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say PJ has \( x \) cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3x \) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3x + 12 \) cards.

Now, we know the total number of cards is 341. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7x + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7x = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have.

Smendrick has \( 3x = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3x + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

So, the total number of eggs Cindy had is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

**Final Answer: 27**"
"First, let's calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.

Shipping cost for weight = 4 pounds * $0.35 per pound = $1.40

The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

Shipping cost for distance = 20 miles * $0.08 per mile = $1.60

Total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, let's calculate the refund Milly will get. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.

Refund amount = $32 * 75% = $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

Now, let's calculate how much money Milly will lose. She paid $32 for the book and will get a refund of $24, but she also has to pay $3 for shipping.

Total money spent = Cost of book - Refund + Shipping cost
Total money spent = $32 - $24 + $3 = $11

So, the final numerical answer is:

$11"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which costs:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the money she had initially:

\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:

\[ 60 \]"
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

First week: 8,000 bars

Second week: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week: Three times the first week, so \( 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \) bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to see how many bars are left after the first three weeks.

Total for the first three weeks: \( 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \) bars

Since he produces 50,000 bars each month, the production for the fourth week is:

\( 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \) bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. **Recording TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

2. **Writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - 2 hours = 120 minutes.

3. **Doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup per week = \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the time spent on all activities per week:
- Total time per week = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
- Total time per month = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

So, the final numerical answer is:
1128 minutes."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base cost for installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base amount. So, the additional cost for mirrors is:
   2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00

3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base amount. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is:
   1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00

4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base amount. So, the additional cost for pictures is:
   10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Now, let's add all the costs together:

- Base cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

So, the final cost for Angela is $224.00."
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Eva's savings: $20.00
Anthony's savings: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more that is, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings = 40/100 * $30.00 = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Therefore, Roy's savings are:

Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + $12.00
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Final numerical answer:
Roy has $42.00."
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."

"First, let's figure out how long it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo will also take 18 hours to cross the highway because they are all traveling at the same speed.

Now, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours, and a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take a turtle twice as long to cross the highway. So, one turtle will take \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours to cross the highway.

Since the question asks about four turtles, and each turtle takes 36 hours, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is still 36 hours because they are all traveling at the same speed and crossing the highway one by one.

Final answer:
36"
"First, let's find out how many dishes Rory made. Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, and Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made:

20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes

Now, Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Since Rory made 40 dishes, Jada made:

2 × 40 = 80 dishes

To find out how many dishes they all made together, we add the number of dishes each one made:

Kora's dishes (20) + Rory's dishes (40) + Jada's dishes (80) = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes

So, together they made 140 clay dishes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200. So, the new price is:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop after all her savings and her mom's contribution. This means the total amount she has, including the $50, is $400. So, the amount she has before the $50 is:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gave her $80. So, the amount in her purse is:

"First, let's find out how many slices Adam gets from the large and small apples.

From 3 large apples, he gets:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From 5 small apples, he gets:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

So, in total, Adam has:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"First, let's find out how much milk the farmer gets from 3 cows.

Each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day. So, 3 cows give:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. He already gets 15 liters from 3 cows. So, he needs:
\[ 25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Since each cow gives 5 liters, to get the additional 10 liters, he needs:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"First, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used.

For the first glue stick:
- It has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) is not used.
- The length not used is \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 \) mm.

For the second glue stick:
- It has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) is not used.
- The length not used is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \) mm.

For the third glue stick:
- It has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \) is not used.
- The length not used is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \) mm.

Now, let's calculate the length not used for each glue stick:

1. For the first glue stick:
\[ \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \text{ mm} \]

2. For the second glue stick:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ mm} \]

3. For the third glue stick:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ mm} \]

Finally, we add up the lengths not used from all three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ mm} \]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 mm."
"First, let's add up all the money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

So, the total amount of money Gabriel has is:

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:
- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

So, the total cost is:
\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the total cost:

6 × $2 = $12

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so:

3 × $3 = $9

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

$12 + $9 = $21

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount of money Craig started with to find out how much he has left:

$40 - $21 = $19

"First, let's find out how many socks Jack has. Since Jack collected 60 dishes and he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can say:

\[ \text{Number of socks Jack has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's find out how many socks Peter has. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:

\[ \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many dishes Peter has. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:

\[ \text{Number of dishes Peter has} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

\[ \text{Total number of socks} = 30 (\text{Jack's socks}) + 60 (\text{Peter's socks}) = 90 \]
\[ \text{Total number of dishes} = 60 (\text{Jack's dishes}) + 30 (\text{Peter's dishes}) = 90 \]

"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs on stage, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. Each group needs:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert is 2 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"Brenda's investment accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. The original amount is $300.

First, we calculate the interest for one year:
\[ \text{Interest per year} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. So, for 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 years} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, we calculate:

40 white shirts / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars.

This means the number of white shirts without collars is:

40 white shirts - 20 white shirts with collars = 20 white shirts without collars.

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:

50 floral shirts - 20 floral shirts with buttons = 30 floral shirts without buttons.

Now, to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:

30 floral shirts without buttons - 20 white shirts without collars = 10.

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Now, if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can find out how much he will earn by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

So, the farmer will earn $75."
"First, let's find out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm.

In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

\(45 + 25 = 70\)

So, the final number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pairs.

2. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - James spends $2640 on shoes each year.
   - He buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year.
   - So, the average cost per pair of shoes is \(\frac{2640}{24}\).

3. **Perform the division:**
   - \(\frac{2640}{24} = 110\).

So, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- You are buying 3 baskets of green food.
- So, the total cost for green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food:
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are getting $2 off for each basket of red food.
- So, the cost of each basket of red food after the discount is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- So, the total cost for red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, let's add the total cost of the green food and the red food:
- Total cost for green food: $75
- Total cost for red food: $48
- So, the total amount you have to pay is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:
123"
"First, we need to find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, there are 45 rooms in one-half of the motel.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they will build three times the number of homes built in the first year. So, \(12 \times 3 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years. The total from the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes. So, in the third year, they will build \(48 \times 2 = 96\) homes.

Now, let's add up all the homes built over the three years:
- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\)

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say your age is \( x \).
2. Since you are three years younger than your brother, your brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
3. Since you are two years older than your sister, your sister's age is \( x - 2 \).
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

Now, we add all the ages together and set the sum equal to 87:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 87 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 6x = 78 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to have enough for all the students and have some extra glue sticks left over.

Final numerical answer:
7"
"First, let's find out how much water passes through the river after the heavy rain. The amount of water doubles, so:

4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So we add that to the amount after the heavy rain:

8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"Let's break it down day by day.

**Day 0:**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Now, 70 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.
- So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Now, 490 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.
- So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is **3430**."
"First, let's find out how much money Rafaela received in tips.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers. So, we multiply 40 by $20:

40 * $20 = $800

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Now, Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we calculate:

10% of $800 = 0.10 * $800 = $80

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela. We subtract this from the amount Rafaela received:

$800 - $80 = $720

Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we add the amounts they each received:

$800 (Rafaela) + $720 (Julieta) = $1520

So, Julieta and Rafaela received $1520 in tips altogether."
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

"First, let's figure out how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, but since the time to earn a badge doesn't affect the number of badges earned in a year, Amber also earns:
1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so:
3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
Wendy's badges - Amber's badges = 36 badges - 12 badges = 24 badges

So, Wendy earns 24 more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's find out how many hours Paige baked. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours.

Next, we calculate how many banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she bakes 2 loaves every hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40.00 \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \$40.00 \]"
"Gretchen has 70 gold coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, the number of silver coins she has is:

70 (gold coins) - 30 = 40 (silver coins)

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins

So, Gretchen has 110 coins in total."
"First, let's find out how many burritos the students ate in total. If there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, then the total number of burritos eaten by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we need to add the burritos that Mr. George ate to the total number of burritos eaten. Mr. George ate 20 burritos, so:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

"First, let's find out how many green cars there are. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, and there are 12 red cars, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:

12 (red cars) - 2 = 10 green cars

Next, we need to find out how many blue cars there are. Since there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, we can calculate the number of blue cars as follows:

10 (green cars) × 3 = 30 blue cars

Now, we know the total number of cars in the rink is 75. We can find out how many yellow cars there are by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

75 (total cars) - 12 (red cars) - 10 (green cars) - 30 (blue cars) = 23 yellow cars

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
3. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that together they have 85 books. So, we can write the equation:

\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."
"First, we need to find out how much the bag of sweet potatoes weighed. Since the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weighed 5 pounds, we can calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the bag of carrots weighed. The carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. So, we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs. If there are 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, then:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 3-ounce boxes of jello Greg needs to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can calculate the number of boxes needed as follows:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much 12 boxes will cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost will be:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."
"First, we need to find out how much the electronics seller spent in total on the phones. Since the seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, we multiply 5 by $700.

5 phones * $700 per phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000 to the electronics seller. To find out how much change the seller will get back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given.

$4000 - $3500 = $500

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays in a month. Since she pays 60% of the $400, we calculate:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining amount:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

"First, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them.

To find 3/5 of 300:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = \frac{3 \times 300}{5} = \frac{900}{5} = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

Next, we need to find out how much money he will make from selling these chickens at $50 each to make a profit of $2000.

Let's denote the cost price of the chickens he took to the market as \( C \).

The selling price of the chickens is $50 each, so for 180 chickens, the total selling price is:
\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, the cost price \( C \) of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ C + 2000 = 9000 \]
\[ C = 9000 - 2000 \]
\[ C = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000.

"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the usual length of Elaina's concert is \( x \) minutes.
2. For the final concert, it is twice as long as her usual concert, so it is \( 2x \) minutes.
3. She also performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert.
4. The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

So, we can write the equation for the total runtime of the final concert as:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 50 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concert is 25 minutes.

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in.

Now, we subtract these 10 microphones from the total to find out how many microphones were able to be arranged in pairs:

50 - 10 = 40

Since the microphones that were arranged in pairs are in groups of 2, we divide the number of arranged microphones by 2 to find the number of pairs:

40 ÷ 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

20 pairs"
"First, let's find out how many birds Jerry sees in each part of the question:

1. **Birds nesting in the bushes:** 6 birds
2. **Birds flying overhead:** \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6 birds
   - To find \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6, we calculate \( 6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4 \) birds
3. **Groups of eight birds each feeding:** 3 groups of 8 birds
   - So, \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:

- Birds nesting in the bushes: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Groups of eight birds feeding: 24

Total number of birds = \( 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \)

**Final Answer: 34**"
"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, the number of cookies left is:

55 - 5 = 50 cookies

She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"First, let's find out how many petals all the orchids have together. Since each orchid has 5 petals and Joelle has 5 orchids, we multiply 5 (orchids) by 5 (petals per orchid):

5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Each daisy has 10 petals and Joelle has 4 daisies, so we multiply 4 (daisies) by 10 (petals per daisy):

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:

40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of 100 plants are indoor plants, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

These 75 plants are either outdoor plants or flowering plants. Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

So, there are 50 outdoor plants. The rest of the plants are flowering plants:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 flowering plants. To find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"First, we need to find out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, we divide 121 by 11 to find the speed of a thingamabob.

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of a whirligig.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second."
"To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The salad costs $6.
2. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods every day.
5. The cost of the carrots is the total cost minus the cost of the salad and yogurt, so $11 - $9 = $2.
6. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day."
"First, let's find out how much Mark makes per hour after the raise. He used to make $10 an hour and now he makes $2 more, so:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Mark now makes $12 per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many hours he works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days, so:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

So, Mark works 40 hours a week.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his new hourly wage:

\[ 40 \times 12 = 480 \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Earnings**: Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

2. **Earnings from Mowing Lawns**:
   - Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times.
   - Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times (since it was thrice as many times as Joe's).
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times (five times as many as Joe's).

3. **Payment for Mowing**:
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Since Joe's lawn was mowed \( x \) times and she was paid $6 for it, the payment per mow is \( \frac{6}{x} \).

4. **Calculating Earnings from Mowing**:
   - Earnings from mowing Joe's lawn: \( 6 \) dollars.
   - Earnings from mowing Kamala's lawn: \( 3x \times \frac{6}{x} = 18 \) dollars.
   - Earnings from mowing Alba's lawn: \( 5x \times \frac{6}{x} = 30 \) dollars.

5. **Total Earnings from Mowing**:
   - Total earnings from mowing: \( 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \) dollars.

6. **Earnings from Lemonade Sales**:
   - Total earnings: $80.
   - Earnings from mowing: $54.
   - Therefore, earnings from lemonade sales: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \) dollars.

**Final Answer**: Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find out how much Carl weighs. Since Carl is 16 kg more than Martin, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find out how much Christian weighs. Christian is 8 kg more than Carl, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find out how much Harry weighs. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

So, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's find out how much John earns from renting his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. So, the total hours he rents his car out each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's find out how many notebooks Martha originally had. If Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she must have originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. So, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

Final answer:
1"
"Dijana rowed for 50 miles.

Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. So, we first find 1/5 of 50 miles:
1/5 of 50 = 50 / 5 = 10 miles.

Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana, so:
Anis rowed = 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles.

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to get the total distance:
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies.

Susan originally made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, there are:
100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews.

So, we divide 96 by 6:
96 ÷ 6 = 16

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Today, Daniel read 0 pages.

Now, let's calculate the total pages read by each:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"First, let's figure out how much soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.

Calvin and his wife are adults, so they will each have one adult's bowl. That's 2 adult's bowls for them.

The two children will each have one child's bowl, which is 2 child's bowls for them.

So, in total, for one meal, they will need 2 (adult's bowls) + 2 (child's bowls) = 4 bowls of soup.

Calvin has enough soup to fill 8 child's bowls. After the family has their meal, the number of child's bowls left will be:

8 (total child's bowls) - 2 (child's bowls for the family) = 6 child's bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover bowls by the number of children:

6 (leftover child's bowls) ÷ 2 (children) = 3.

So, each child will be able to have 3 more bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 3 bowls of soup for lunch."
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50.

First, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50

Then, we add the cost of the ballpen:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

So, William spent $8.00 in all."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, we first calculate the material needed for the small and large masks separately, and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, we need to find out how many times 4 goes into 20, which is 5.
- So, if 4 small masks need 2 yards, 20 small masks (which is 5 times more) will need \(2 \times 5 = 10\) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, we need to find out how many times 3 goes into 8. Since 8 is not a multiple of 3, we calculate the material needed directly.
- So, 8 large masks will need \(8 \times 2.25 = 18\) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Material for small masks: 10 yards
- Material for large masks: 18 yards
- Total material needed: \(10 + 18 = 28\) yards

So, Jo would need 28 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

First, let's find the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times, which means she bought 27 tickets.

Next, we need to find out how much each ticket cost on average. We know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money by the number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's figure out how many hours Harold works each day. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so:

\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleep)} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours (work)} \]

Next, we know Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day. So, the total time he spends on sleep, work, and walking his dog is:

\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleep)} + 8 \text{ hours (work)} + 1 \text{ hour (dog walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has, we subtract the time he spends on sleep, work, and walking his dog from the total hours in a day:

\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's find out how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.

So, the blue shoe boxes left are:
7 (original) - 3 (used) = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's find out how many red shoe boxes he uses. He uses 1/3 of his 9 red shoe boxes.

1/3 of 9 is:
9 ÷ 3 = 3 red shoe boxes used.

So, the red shoe boxes left are:
9 (original) - 3 (used) = 6 red shoe boxes left.

Now, let's add the blue and red shoe boxes left:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes left.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"First, we need to find out how many books Joseph originally had. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah has 9 books, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Joseph originally had 18 books. But then, Joseph lost 2 of them. To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we subtract the 2 books he lost from the original 18 books:

\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]

So, Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie. 

To find 1/5 of 30, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, we need to find out how many marbles Dean has left. He originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 6 to Jamie and 10 to Donald, we subtract these from his original amount:

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.

**Final Answer: 14**"
"Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.
Let's say Adam's age four years ago was \(x\). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we have:
\[52 = 2x\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = 52 / 2 = 26\]
So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:
\[26 + 4 = 30\]
To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[30 + 8 = 38\]
So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first find twice Farmer Brown's farm:
2 * 200 = 400 acres

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount:
400 + 100 = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

To find the total number of acres both farms have together, we add Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms:
200 + 500 = 700 acres

The two farms have 700 acres together."
"First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes per hour. The question states he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we subtract 10 from 50:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in his workday:

40 packages/hour × 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we know Colby earns $0.20 for every package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a day, we multiply the number of packages he completes by the amount he earns per package:

320 packages × $0.20/package = $64

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

$64"
"First, let's find out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme one takes 4 times that long.

So, for an extreme sudoku:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes (which is half an hour).

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there were 20 red balloons, he threw \(2 \times 20 = 40\) pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

He threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Let's say there were \(y\) yellow balloons. So, he threw \(3 \times y = 3y\) pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons.

The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. So, we can write the equation:
\[40 + 3y = 58\]

To find \(y\), we need to solve the equation:
\[3y = 58 - 40\]
\[3y = 18\]
\[y = \frac{18}{3}\]
\[y = 6\]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles a day for 30 days.

So, the total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Now, we know Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles after which a tune-up is needed.

So, the number of tune-ups = 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups.

Final numerical answer:
3"
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total hours Bruce works over the three days, we add the hours together:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in all these three days."
"First, let's find out how much Julia and Nadine spent in total.

1. The cake cost $11.
2. For the balloons, since 1 dozen is 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the cost as follows:
   - 12 balloons / 2 balloons = 6 sets of 2 balloons
   - 6 sets * $0.5 = $3
3. The ice cream cost $7 each and they bought 2 tubs, so:
   - 2 tubs * $7 = $14

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
- Cake: $11
- Balloons: $3
- Ice cream: $14

Total spent = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to make this purchase, the total amount they had together was $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each one had.

$28 ÷ 2 = $14

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"First, let's count the total number of fruits Kira bought:

- Apples: 3

3 + 5 + 6 = 14

Next, we need to subtract the number of fruits Lola ate:

Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

So, we subtract 2 from the total number of fruits:

14 - 2 = 12

Final answer:
12 pieces of fruit are left."
"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, and there are 6 students playing tennis, we can calculate the number of students playing volleyball as follows:

Number of students playing volleyball = 2 × Number of students playing tennis
Number of students playing volleyball = 2 × 6
Number of students playing volleyball = 12

Next, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students. We know there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:

Number of students playing soccer = 16 boys + 22 girls
Number of students playing soccer = 38

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to get the total number of students:

Total number of students = Number of students playing tennis + Number of students playing volleyball + Number of students playing soccer
Total number of students = 6 + 12 + 38
Total number of students = 56

So, the final numerical answer is:
56"
"First, let's find out how many lollipops were sold in total. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying these lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

So, Larry has 47 pets."
"First, let's figure out how many slices Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats:

2 slices/day * 2 = 4 slices/day

Now, let's add how many slices Abby and Josh eat together in a day:

Abby's slices/day + Josh's slices/day = 2 slices/day + 4 slices/day = 6 slices/day

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together in a day:

24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"To find out how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months from when she turned 5 to when she turned 10.

Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and continued until she was 10 years old. So, we need to count the number of years from 5 to 10, which is 5 years.

Since she collects one shell every month, we need to find out how many months are in 5 years. There are 12 months in a year, so:

5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60"
"First, we need to find out how many cups are in each row. Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows. So, we divide 27 by 3:

27 ÷ 3 = 9

This means there are 9 cups in each row.

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. So, we divide the 9 cups in each row by 2 to find out how many are chamomile and how many are mint:

9 ÷ 2 = 4.5

Since we can't have half a cup of tea, we need to think about this in a way that makes sense for a primary school level. In this case, it's likely that the problem is set up in a way that the number of cups should be a whole number. However, based on the information given and the math, the number of mint tea cups in each row would be 4.5, but in a practical scenario, this would need to be adjusted to whole numbers, possibly by having 4 or 5 cups of each type in a row, depending on how the cups are actually divided. 

For the final answer, based on the math provided:

The number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5. 

But for a practical answer, we would need to adjust to whole numbers. 

Final numerical answer: 4.5"
"To find out the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we need to figure out how many trips he can make in 8 hours and then divide the total number of berries by the number of trips.

1. First, we know it takes the sloth 4 hours for one trip down and back up.
2. In 8 hours, the sloth can make \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \) trips.
3. The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in total.
4. To find out how many berries he picks per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips: \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \).

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12.

"First, we need to find out how much water is in the tank. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water that will be used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Friday or Saturday:**
   - He saw 5 movies on Friday or Saturday.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - He saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - He had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month. So, the remaining money is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

On the last day of the month, it's a Friday, so he can buy a movie ticket for $10 and still have:
\[20 - 10 = 10\] dollars left.

Since he wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which cost $8 and $2 respectively, he will spend:
\[8 + 2 = 10\] dollars.

So, he will have:
\[10 - 10 = 0\] dollars left.

Therefore, he can see **1 more movie** on this Friday.

**Final Answer:**
1"
"First, let's find out the calorie count for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, we calculate:
\[ 600 \div 3 = 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, we calculate:
\[ 450 \div 3 = 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} \]

Now, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per roll} = 40,000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, let's calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per muffin} = 45,000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins to get the total calories:
\[ 40,000 \text{ calories} + 45,000 \text{ calories} = 85,000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ 85,000 \text{ calories} \]"
"First, let's find out how many Junebugs Rita removed each day:

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she removed twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

\[ 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 \]

Adding these together step by step:

\[ 39 + 78 = 117 \]
\[ 117 + 78 = 195 \]
\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]
\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:

\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

So, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

60 miles/hour * 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, we calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

30 miles/hour * 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up all the toys Sophie has and then subtract that number from the total number of toys she has now.

1. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
2. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
3. The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
4. The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Jean's age is \( J \).
2. Paul's age is \( J + 10 \) because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is \( (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \) because Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Now, we know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So we can write the equation:

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 2J + J + J + 10 + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ J = 20 \]

So Jean is 20 years old. Now we can find the ages of Paul and Peter:

Paul's age is \( J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \) years old.
Peter's age is \( 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \) years old.

So, the age of Peter is 50 years old."
"First, let's figure out how many balloons Maria's friends got at the start. Maria has 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends at the start is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself. So, the total number of balloons Maria had at the start is:

\[ 1 \text{ balloon} \]

Next, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons given is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the initial number of balloons Maria had to the additional balloons given by her mom:

\[ 1 \text{ (initial balloon Maria had)} + 8 \text{ (initial balloons given to friends)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

24"
"First, let's find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so that's \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes. 

They also have 10 boxes of stuff already. 

So, in total, they have \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes of stuff.

Each table can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff. 

They already own 15 tables. 

So, the 15 tables can fit \(15 \times 2 = 30\) boxes.

They have 60 boxes in total, and 30 boxes can be placed on the 15 tables they already own. 

So, they need space for \(60 - 30 = 30\) more boxes.

Since each new table can fit 2 boxes, they need \(\frac{30}{2} = 15\) new tables.

**Final Answer: 15**"
"First, let's find out the total distance each person spits their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.
- So, the total distance Zoey spits her seeds is \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

For Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.
- So, the total distance Sydney spits her seeds is \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Now, let's find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the total distance by the number of people:
- Average total distance = \(820 \div 2 = 410\) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.

Now, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

Next, we calculate the money made from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Money made = \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Money made = \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, we find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

- Difference = \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's figure out how long Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. That's a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. The remaining 5 hours (17 hours total minus the first 12 hours) will cost 70 pesos each.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

Now, we add the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional 5 hours:
1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for 24 hours, it would cost:
1600 pesos

To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of his stay from the 24-hour rate:
1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"First, let's find out how much hay each sheep needs. We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. Since there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds, the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. Since there are 12 sheep and each needs 7 pounds, the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. So, \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
159"
"First, let's find out how much money John earned in the week. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the 50 dollars he spent on gas from his earnings:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each. The total cost of the pencils is:

\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars. We divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars} \div 25 \text{ dollars/pen} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ 650 \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to multiply the number of children in each row by the number of rows, and then multiply that by the number of schools.

1. Number of children in each row = 8
2. Number of rows per school = 7
3. Number of schools = 5

First, we find out how many children are there in one school:
\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school} \]

Next, we find out how many children are there in all 5 schools:
\[ 56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the final number of children in the drill is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gets from the coupons. The teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ 842 \]"
"To find out how much Patty charged for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is $35 per hour, we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
\]

So, Patty charged **$178.75** for the job."
"First, let's find out how much James paid for the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, he gets them for 40% off. To find the discount amount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the amount he actually paid after the discount is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Finally, to find out how much money he was out, we subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the amount he paid for all the CDs:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. But the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which in this context means how much he spent. So, the final numerical answer is:

$90"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from each type of root crop:

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the earnings:

- Total from yams: $9
- Total from sweet potatoes: $20
- Total from carrots: $5

Total earnings: \( 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \) dollars.

So, Jen will earn **34 dollars**."
"First, let's find out how far James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.

60% of 20 miles = 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate how long it takes him to swim these 12 miles. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour:

Time to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as his swimming time. So, his rest time is:

Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

Now, he has to swim the remaining distance. The total distance is 20 miles, and he has already swum 12 miles, so the remaining distance is:

Remaining distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

He swims the remaining 8 miles at half his original speed. His original speed was 2 miles per hour, so half of that is:

Half speed = 2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Time to swim the remaining 8 miles at half speed is:

Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time to get across the lake:

Total time = Time to swim first part + Rest time + Time to swim second part
Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

So, it took him 17 hours to get across the lake."
"First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread seven times as many as Sam had last Friday would be. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.

Seven times 70 is:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

The bakery has 40 less than this amount. So, we subtract 40 from 490:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

Final answer:
450"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so she had:

At the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

For the New York Times:
- Each copy costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, for 6 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

For the Wall Street Journal:
- Each copy costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, for 10 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how old Marcus is. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26, we can find Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from 26.

So, Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\).

Now, we know that Marcus is half of Leo’s age. If Marcus is 21, then Leo’s age is twice Marcus's age.

So, Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\).

**Final Answer:**
Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use ""B"" for Bahati's points, ""A"" for Azibo's points, and ""D"" for Dinar's points.

From the information given:
- Bahati's points (B) = Azibo's points (A) + 20
- Bahati's points (B) = Dinar's points (D) + 10

We also know that:
- B + A + D = 45

Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute B in the total points equation.

Let's use B = A + 20:
- (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45

Combine like terms:
- 3A + 30 = 45

Subtract 30 from both sides:
- 3A = 15

Divide by 3:
- A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to use the information given:

- The paper is 100 pages per inch.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

First, we calculate the number of pages per inch:
100 pages/inch

Then, we multiply this by the thickness of the book in inches to find the total number of pages:
100 pages/inch × 1.5 inches = 150 pages

So, the book has 150 pages.

150 pages"
"First, let's figure out how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 hours, there are:

15 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 15 to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are:

900 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 60 intervals

Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:

60 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1800 reports

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time from when she went to sleep until she woke up, and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Total time from going to sleep to waking up:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - 8 hours = 8 × 60 minutes = 480 minutes.

2. **Time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

3. **Time Kim woke up earlier:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m. but woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Time Kim was actually on her bed:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
   - 7 hours 55 minutes = 7 × 60 minutes + 55 minutes = 420 minutes + 55 minutes = 475 minutes.

5. **Subtract the time she was sleepwalking:**
   - Total time on bed - Time sleepwalking = 475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's find out how many measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, and one dozen equals 12, he has:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons he has. He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"First, let's find out how many beds are currently occupied in the hospital.

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, we calculate:

1000 beds * 1/5 = 200 beds

This means 200 beds are currently occupied.

Now, let's find out how many beds are unoccupied:

1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 unoccupied beds

Next, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

Now, we add the newly admitted patients to the current number of occupied beds:

200 occupied beds + 700 new patients = 900 occupied beds

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:

1000 total beds - 900 occupied beds = 100 unoccupied beds

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's find out how many emails are not work emails. Robyn sends 16 emails a day, and 7 of those are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

16 (total emails) - 7 (work emails) = 9 (non-work emails)

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

\(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\) emails are sent to family.

Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for her boyfriend. We subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

9 (non-work emails) - 6 (family emails) = 3 emails

Finally, we need to find out how many of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. One-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\) email is sent to her boyfriend.

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, we find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 (Aliya's age) × 3 = 9 years old.

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age. Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we have:

Shawna's father's age = 9 (Shawna's age) × 5 = 45 years old.

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"To find the correct number of people who attended the concert, we need to understand that Courtney's count of 48 was 20% more than the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

Courtney's count (48) is 120% of the actual number (100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:
\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jeffrey carried \( x \) balls.
2. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried \( 2x \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) balls.

Now, we know that Jason carried 2 balls. So, \( 2x = 2 \). Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls.

To find the total number of balls, we add the number of balls each boy carried:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
7"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so four times that is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

This means that on the fourth day, the pirates dug enough holes to increase the total from 29 to 40. Therefore, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many corn chips Collins got. Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than they did, Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add up the corn chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:

\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"First, we need to find out how much the travel tickets cost in total. The problem states that the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.

The cost of supplies is $400. To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 400 \times 0.50 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost for travel is $600. 

Final answer:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon. According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. So, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
\[ 9A = 339 + 21 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = \frac{360}{9} \]
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's figure out how many episodes there are in total. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, we divide 20 by 2 to find the number of episodes:

20 ÷ 2 = 10 episodes

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes × 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"First, let's calculate the distance the bird travels in each part of her journey.

1. **First part of the journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second part of the journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third part of the journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Now, let's find the net distance traveled south and north.

- Total distance traveled south: 300 miles (first part) + 110 miles (third part) = 410 miles
- Total distance traveled north: 36 miles (second part)

The net distance from the starting point to the ending point is the difference between the total distance traveled south and the total distance traveled north.

- Net distance = Distance traveled south - Distance traveled north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **374 miles**."

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she got 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. Her friends at the surprise party had 4 dozen (48) brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had is:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten. So, the number of brownies left is:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]

So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

The total age of all three family members is:
30"

   - Total time: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, we add the total times for each type of string:
- Total time: \(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total. The first 2 phones are at full price, and each phone after the first 2 is at half price.

1. The cost of the first 2 phones is:
   \(2 \times \$600 = \$1200\)

2. The cost of the next 2 phones (at half price) is:
   \(2 \times \frac{\$600}{2} = 2 \times \$300 = \$600\)

3. Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
   \(\$1200 + \$600 = \$1800\)

So, John paid a total of \$1800 for the phones."
"First, we need to find out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team by adding 7 to 13.

So, for Zeke's team:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:
\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 33 \]"
"First, we need to find the total length of the fence. Since the fence is rectangular, we can find the total length by adding together the lengths of all four sides.

The garden is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. So, the total length of the fence will be:
- Two lengths of 15 feet each: \(15 + 15 = 30\) feet
- Two widths of 10 feet each: \(10 + 10 = 20\) feet

Adding these together gives us the total perimeter of the fence:
\[30 + 20 = 50 \text{ feet}\]

Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2:
\[50 \times 2 = 100\]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which makes:

2 (to mom) + 2 (to sister) = 4 boxes

Now, we know she bought 12 boxes in total, so the number of boxes she kept is:

12 (total boxes) - 4 (given away) = 8 boxes

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. Since she kept 8 boxes, and these represent 1/4 of the total, the total number of boxes she had is:

8 boxes * 4 = 32 boxes

Now, we know each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges is:

32 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 640 oranges

She kept 1/4 of these oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:

640 oranges * 1/4 = 160 oranges

The rest of the oranges were sold. So, the number of oranges she sold is:

640 oranges (total) - 160 oranges (kept) = 480 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 480 oranges."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of states in the USA is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India is \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of states in both countries together. This would be the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:

\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

To simplify, we combine like terms:

\[ \text{Total number of states} = x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

To add \( x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we can rewrite \( x \) as \( \frac{2x}{2} \):

\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

Now, we need to know the actual number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states. So, we substitute \( x = 50 \) into the equation:

\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"First, let's find out how much the books cost in total. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

So, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost of the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

5"
"First, let's find out how many cherries Richard has. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we know the total number of cherries is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries. Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final answer:
\[ 20 \]"

- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

Saturday's earnings:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

Sunday's earnings:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days:
- Saturday + Sunday: $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned $465 for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Over 8 days, she will use:

4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, the number of bottles she will need is:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"First, let's find out how much cheaper the red car is compared to the blue car.

The blue car costs $100, and the red car is 40% cheaper. To find 40% of $100, we do:

\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Now, we can find the price of the red car:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car together:

\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost of both cars is $160."
"First, let's figure out how old Emil will be when he turns 24. Emil is currently 19 years old, so he will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = 5 years.

When Emil is 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
- He will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.

Now, since this will happen in 5 years, we need to find out their current ages:
- Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
- Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
43 + 7 = 50

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add all the beads together:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

So, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's find out how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the total pounds of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we can find the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish."
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 × 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Now, 25% of the remaining 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 × 24 = 6 students

Finally, to find out how many students are leaving early, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students

So, the final number of students leaving early is:

12 students"
"First, we need to find out the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots.

Next, we need to find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie. To do this, we add the sizes of their boots and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots}}{2} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much space one plant and the space between it and the next plant take up. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot (since 12 inches = 1 foot). Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. So, each plant and the space after it take up:

1 foot (for the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants) = 2.5 feet

Now, Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant and its space after take up:

111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants Pat needs to buy is:

27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we divide the number of pretzels Edgar eats by 2.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, so his brother eats:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

Next, to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, in a week, Edgar's brother eats:
\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 63 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: 3 petunias * $3.00 each = $9.00
- For sweet potato vines: 2 vines * $2.50 each = $5.00

So, the total cost for one basket is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Now, since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:

- Total cost for 5 baskets: $14.00 * 5 = $70.00

Therefore, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for the shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

To find 25% of $2,000.00:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Jessica can spend $6,000.00 on shoes in a year.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00 if each pair costs $1,000.00:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's figure out how many shrimp Emily can handle in one minute for both peeling and sautéing combined.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute (30 shrimp ÷ 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute).

So, in one minute, Emily can handle:
- 6 shrimp peeled
- 3 shrimp sautéed

This means she can process a total of 9 shrimp per minute (6 + 3 = 9).

Now, we need to find out how long it will take her to process 90 shrimp.

If she can process 9 shrimp per minute, then to process 90 shrimp, it will take:
90 shrimp ÷ 9 shrimp per minute = 10 minutes.

So, it will take Emily 10 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

10 minutes"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 3 hours, it cools the room by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees per hour.
   - For 4 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:

- Cooling from low setting: \(+6\) degrees
- Cooling from high setting: \(+12\) degrees
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 \]

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees"
"First, let's figure out how old Bill's dad was when he saw Comet Halley. We know that Bill's dad saw the comet when it was at its closest to the sun, and this happens every 75 years.

If Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we need to determine how many times Comet Halley has orbited the sun since then to find out when Bill saw it for the first time.

Let's assume Bill's dad saw the comet for the first time when he was 30. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we need to find out how many 75-year periods have passed for Bill to see the comet a second time.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw it for the first time. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Now, we need to figure out how many 75-year periods have passed for Bill to be 90 years old. Since each period is 75 years, we can calculate the number of periods by dividing 90 by 75, but since 90 is not a multiple of 75, we need to find the closest multiple of 75 that is less than 90, which is 75 itself. This means 1 full orbit has passed.

So, if Bill was 90 years old after 1 full orbit, he must have seen the comet for the first time 75 years before he was 90. Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Final answer:
15"
"Let's break it down:

- For the electric bill, he writes 1 check per month. In a year, that's \(1 \times 12 = 12\) checks.
- For the gas bill, he also writes 1 check per month. In a year, that's another \(1 \times 12 = 12\) checks.
- For the church, he writes 2 checks per month. In a year, that's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks.
- For the pest and lawn service, he writes 1 check every quarter. There are 4 quarters in a year, so that's \(1 \times 4 = 4\) checks.

Now, we add them all up:

\(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\)

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of flights the first plane makes:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - So, the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\).
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total howling time in seconds is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120}{60} = 2 \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"First, let's figure out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam received $12 from his father.

Now, let's add the money Adam received from his mother and father:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam received a total of $18 from his parents.

The trousers cost $30, so to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

**Final Answer: 12**"
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20. Since there are 4 children, the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is 10 years old.

To find Wilfred's age, we subtract the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age of the group:

\[ \text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old."
"First, we need to find out how much money Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund. 

From his neighbors, Walter collected $500. 
From the online fund, he collected $1500. 

Adding these amounts together: 
$500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. 

So, we multiply the total amount collected by everyone else by 3: 
$2000 * 3 = $6000

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"First, let's find out how many cookies were there in total. There were 100 guests, and each brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find out how many people were in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. Let's say each kid gets 1 slice of the watermelon.
2. Then each adult gets 2 slices (because each adult gets twice as much as a kid).

So, if we have 2 adults and 4 kids:
- Each adult gets 2 slices.
- Each kid gets 1 slice.

This means:
- Total slices for adults = 2 adults * 2 slices/adult = 4 slices
- Total slices for kids = 4 kids * 1 slice/kid = 4 slices

So, the total number of slices is 4 (for adults) + 4 (for kids) = 8 slices.

Now, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult gets 2 slices out of 8 total slices:

\[ \text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the 10 appointments. Each appointment takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and the time for the appointments to find the total time spent on these activities.

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours.

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. We subtract the 8 hours spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the 9 hours he is at the clinic.

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To find out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make the cake and then subtract that from 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Now, let's add all these times together:

20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

180 minutes is the same as 3 hours.

If Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm.

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold together.
2. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
3. Together, they sold \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.
4. We know they sold 64 chocolate bars in total.
5. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

So, we do the division: \(64 \div 8 = 8\).

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"First, let's find out how much it costs for one session with 10 students:

- The cost to rent the studio is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost for students per session is $1.50 * 10 = $15.

So, the total cost for one session is $25 (studio rental) + $15 (students) = $40.

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the weekly cost is $40 * 3 = $120.

Now, let's find out the monthly cost. Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, the monthly cost is $120 * 4 = $480.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we divide 64 by 4:

64 ÷ 4 = 16

This means Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, we divide 56 by 7:

56 ÷ 7 = 8

This means Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's boxes from the number in Peter's boxes:

16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, in one month, the number of new porcupines born is:

\[ \text{New porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since this happens every month, in one year (which has 12 months), the total number of new porcupines born is:

\[ \text{New porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The original population of porcupines is 50. Adding the new porcupines born in a year to the original population gives:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth.

Volume = Length × Width × Depth
Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
Volume = 1400 cubic feet

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons are needed.

Gallons of water needed = Volume × 5.9
Gallons of water needed = 1400 × 5.9
Gallons of water needed = 8260 gallons

Now, we need to find out the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

Cost = Gallons of water needed × Cost per gallon
Cost = 8260 × $0.10
Cost = $826

So, the final cost to fill the pool is $826."
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"First, we need to calculate how far each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference = Shandy's Distance - Matteo's Distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old.

Total students = 3000

Half of these students are over 16 years old:
Over 16 years old = 3000 / 2 = 1500 students

The other half are under 16 years old:
Under 16 years old = 3000 / 2 = 1500 students

Now, let's find out how many of the students over 16 are male and how many are female.

One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
Male students over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375 students

So, the number of female students over 16 is:
Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125 students

Next, let's find out how many of the students under 16 are male and how many are female.

One-half of the students under 16 are male:
Male students under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750 students

So, the number of female students under 16 is:
Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750 students

Now, to find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and the female students under 16:

Total female students = Female students over 16 + Female students under 16
Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

So, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"First, let's find out how many laps each person can run in one hour.

Bethany can run 10 laps.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"First, let's find out how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day, so:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons} \]

So, on the first day, they pumped a total of:
\[ 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, let's calculate how much water they pumped on the second day.

Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons} \]

So, on the second day, they pumped a total of:
\[ 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, let's find out the total amount of water they pumped over the two days:
\[ 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, to find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we subtract the total amount of water pumped from the tank's capacity:
\[ 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[ 6,000 \]"
"To find out the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - So, in 3 hours, it lost \(3 \times 7\% = 21\%\).
   - Before these 3 hours, the power bank was at \(28\% + 21\% = 49\%\).

3. **Charge Before First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - So, in 5 hours, it lost \(5 \times 9\% = 45\%\).
   - Before these 5 hours, the power bank was at \(49\% + 45\% = 94\%\).

So, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was **94%**."
"First, let's find out how much Janet makes in total each hour. She makes $10 from wages and $15 from tips, so:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she wants to save for the down payment. The car costs $10,000 and she wants to save 20% of that:

\[ 10,000 \times 0.20 = 2,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much she makes in a week. She works 40 hours a week, so:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1,000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ 2,000 \div 1,000 = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought.

- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\)
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10. After buying the fruits, he has:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

**Final Answer:**
3"
"First, we need to find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Each pack contains 60 pieces of sweets, so the total number of pieces Anne gave to her friends is:

13 packs × 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

Anne gave these 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends, so each friend received:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to increase the original price by 5% each year.

1. **First Year:**
   - Original price: $120
   - Increase: 5% of $120 = 0.05 * 120 = $6
   - New price after first year: $120 + $6 = $126

2. **Second Year:**
   - New price: $126
   - Increase: 5% of $126 = 0.05 * 126 = $6.30
   - New price after second year: $126 + $6.30 = $132.30

3. **Third Year:**
   - New price: $132.30
   - Increase: 5% of $132.30 = 0.05 * 132.30 = $6.615
   - New price after third year: $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put in each album. She uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means there are 9 pictures in each album.

Next, we know that 3 albums were only selfies and 2 albums were only portraits. So, we need to find out how many pictures are in these albums.

For the selfies:
3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

For the portraits:
2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

To find the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

27 selfies + 18 portraits = 45

So, Olivia had 45 portraits and selfies in total."
"First, we need to find out how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we divide 10 minutes by 3 pages to find the time per page:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \times 18 \text{ pages} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

**Final Answer: 60 minutes**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:** The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests checked out late.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **People checking in in the afternoon:** Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people checking in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **People checking in after dinner:** 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the hotel now has **98 guests**."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, so he picks 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the bananas John has picked:
Wednesday: 4 bananas
Thursday: 6 bananas
Friday: 12 bananas

4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bananas

John has 22 bananas in total."
"First, let's find out how many easy, average, and difficult questions there are in the quiz.

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- These 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so:
  - Average questions: \(36 \div 2 = 18\)
  - Difficult questions: \(36 \div 2 = 18\)

Now, let's calculate how many questions Aries is sure to get right in each category.

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions.
  - \(75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18\)

- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions.
  - Half of 18 = \(18 \div 2 = 9\)

- Difficult questions: Aries is also sure to get half of the difficult questions.
  - Half of 18 = \(18 \div 2 = 9\)

Now, let's add up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get right.

- Total sure points: \(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"First, let's find out how much a large stuffed animal costs. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large one costs three times that, a large stuffed animal costs:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The money earned from the large stuffed animals is:

\[ 12x \text{ dollars} \]

The money earned from the small stuffed animals is:

\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \text{ dollars} \]

The total money earned from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so we can write the equation:

\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:

\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals, which is:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate how many sandwiches each family member eats in a day and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one day:

- The man eats 5 sandwiches.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches.

So, in one day, the family eats:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \]

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies and cupcakes.

From selling cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From selling cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240

Total earnings from cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Next, we need to subtract the money she gave to her sisters:
$320 - ($10 * 2) = $320 - $20 = $300

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
$300"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs.

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:
30 + 30 = 60 eggs

If all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we need to subtract the 60 eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found by their friends from the total number of eggs:
100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs

So, the friends found:
30 eggs

Final numerical answer:
30"
"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
2. So, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. In 30 days, they can mine:
   \[
   1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
43200 \text{ pounds}
\]"
"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If each sandwich costs $1.5, then 8 sandwiches will cost \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

So, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much Tom still needs to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one. 

The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000. Tom sells his old bedroom set for $1000. So, the amount he still needs to pay is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of $2000 each month. To find 10% of $2000, we do:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 × $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's find out how many red balloons burst. Sally had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. 

40% of 25 is:
\[ 25 \times \frac{40}{100} = 25 \times 0.4 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst, leaving her with:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, she has:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection:
75% of 8 is:
\[ 8 \times \frac{75}{100} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she added 6 blue balloons to her collection. Now, let's add up all the balloons she has:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 27 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the opposite of the scenarios where he doesn't have to turn it in. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher.
   - If there's a substitute teacher, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - So, the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework if there's a substitute teacher is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having the normal teacher.
   - If the normal teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
   - So, the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension is 60% (100% - 40%).

3. **Normal Teacher with No Extension but Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
   - So, the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is there, doesn't give an extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension is 20% (100% - 20%).

Now, we need to combine these probabilities:

- **Probability of having a substitute teacher and not having to turn in homework:**
  \[
  50\% \times 0\% = 0\%
  \]

- **Probability of having the normal teacher and getting an extension:**
  \[
  50\% \times 40\% = 20\%
  \]

- **Probability of having the normal teacher, not getting an extension, but Marcus getting a personal extension:**
  \[
  50\% \times 60\% \times 20\% = 50\% \times 0.6 \times 0.2 = 50\% \times 0.12 = 6\%
  \]

Finally, we add these probabilities to find the total chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[
0\% + 20\% + 6\% = 26\%
\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **26%**."
"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for guests after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty.

Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
Seats for graduates: 950
Seats for faculty: 300

Now, we subtract the seats for graduates and faculty from the total seats to find out how many seats are left for guests.

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats for guests

Now, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates.

4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, we can calculate the number of medium-sized jelly beans as follows:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Next, we need to find out how many small jelly beans this is equivalent to. We know that 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans 150 medium-sized jelly beans are equivalent to, we multiply 150 by 3:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

Final answer:
\[ 450 \]"
"First, let's find out how much Melissa earns in total from her jury duty.

Melissa is paid $15 per day. She works for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate her total parking expenses. She pays $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so her total parking expenses are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract her parking expenses from her total earnings to find out her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days in total, so the total number of hours she spends is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses."
"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each and 3 pencils for $6 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the books:
3 books × $16/book = $48

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
3 pencils × $6/pencil = $18

Now, we add the cost of the books and the pencils to find the total amount spent:
$48 + $18 = $66

So, Ted spent a total of $66."
"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he places a bottle every 3 feet, we divide 24 by 3:

24 ÷ 3 = 8 bottles

Now, Richard will drop the candy into each bottle, which takes 5 seconds per bottle. Since he has 8 bottles, we multiply 8 by 5:

8 × 5 = 40 seconds

So, it will take Richard 40 seconds in total to set off all the soda fountains.

40 seconds"
"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples by multiplying forty by two.

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

So, Uncle Franky has 80 apples in total.

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if he packs them with eight apples in one pack. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack.

\[ 80 \div 8 = 10 \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- So, the cost of Parmesan cheese is \( 11 \times 2 = 22 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- So, the cost of Mozzarella cheese is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is \( 22 + 18 = 40 \) dollars.

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money she started with:
- The money left is \( 50 - 40 = 10 \) dollars.

So, the final answer is:
10 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes:

- Jim takes $50,000 in loans per year.
- He goes to college for 4 years.

So, the total amount of loans is:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the money Jim would have earned if he had continued working at his old job:

- Jim's old job paid $25,000 per year.
- He would have worked for 4 years.

So, the total money he would have earned is:
\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, let's calculate his new income after getting a college degree:

- His new income is triple his old income.
- His old income was $25,000.

So, his new income is:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Jim needs to earn to pay back the loans and the money he lost from not working:

- Total loans: $200,000
- Money lost from not working: $100,000

So, the total amount he needs to earn is:
\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Finally, we need to find out how long it will take for Jim to earn $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

**Final Answer: 4 years**"
"First, we need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
6 feet (bed length) + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
8 feet (bed width) + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width.

Area of one fabric piece = 8 feet (length) × 10 feet (width) = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.

Total area of fabric needed = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday**: They delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - Tuesday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday**: They delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - Wednesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

Now, let's add up the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:
- Monday: 425 letters
- Tuesday: 102 letters

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Adding $1 to that: \(10 + 1 = 11\).
   - So, he won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - 1.5 times the amount won in the second race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).
   - So, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total amount won: \(11\).

To find the net amount lost, we subtract the total amount won from the total amount lost:
\[21.5 - 11 = 10.5\]

So, the total net loss is $10.5.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):
\[\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\]

Therefore, the average loss per race is $3.5.

**Final Answer:**
3.5"

"First, let's find out how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet is equal to 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew, Xavier is now 48 + 3 = 51 inches tall.

Next, let's find out Cole's current height. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so he is now 50 + 2 = 52 inches tall.

To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars.
2. The second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars.
3. The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount of money is $1920. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2 \times (x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day each painter worked:**
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.
   - Over 21 days, each painter worked \(21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8}\) days.

3. **Convert the total fraction of days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, \(\frac{63}{8} \times 24 = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189\) hours.

4. **Determine the hours each painter worked:**
   - Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4.
   - So, \(189 \div 4 = 47.25\) hours.

Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's say the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set is \( x \).

In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

The total number of balls he retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this, first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. Therefore, in the first set, he retrieved:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

The number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \( 10 \)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
- The car's price in 2007 is $20,000.
- The depreciation for 2008 is 21% of $20,000.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $20,000 = 0.21 * $20,000 = $4,200.
- Price in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.

Next, let's find the price of the car in 2009:
- The car's price in 2008 is $15,800.
- The depreciation for 2009 is 21% of $15,800.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $15,800 = 0.21 * $15,800 = $3,318.
- Price in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.

Finally, let's find the price of the car in 2010:
- The car's price in 2009 is $12,482.
- The depreciation for 2010 is 21% of $12,482.
- Depreciation amount = 21% of $12,482 = 0.21 * $12,482 = $2,621.22.
- Price in 2010 = $12,482 - $2,621.22 = $9,860.78.

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

50 books / 2 = 25 books in English.

Next, let's find out how many books are in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

10% of 50 books = 0.10 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 books (total) - 25 books (English) - 5 books (German) = 20 books in Spanish.

So, there are 20 Spanish books."
"First, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 325 by 4:

- Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
- Each tile costs $12.
- The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, we need to find out how much the insurance costs after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost.

The normal cost is $120 a month. To find 60% of $120, we do:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the insurance cost after the accident is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means the insurance now costs $192 a month. To find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 2304 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

So, in a week, he uses:
- 4 twin sheets
- 1 king sheet

In a year (52 weeks), he uses:
- \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets
- \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets

Now, let's see how many loads of laundry he needs to do.

His machine can wash:
- 2 twin sheets at a time
- 1 king sheet at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads

So, in total, he does:
- \(104 + 52 = 156\) loads of laundry in a year.

**Final Answer: 156**"
"First, let's figure out how many movies they watch on Sunday. Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday, and they watch 4 movies on Saturday, they watch:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies on Sunday} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies they watch in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday):

\[ 4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies per weekend} \]

If they watch movies every weekend for 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is:

\[ 6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ movies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

24"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.
2. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers}
   \]
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers}
   \]
4. To find out how many stickers Leo has now, we add the stickers he had last year to the stickers he collected this year:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250 \text{ stickers}
   \]

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection."
"First, let's find out how much food Imma's cats eat in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, we can calculate the daily food consumption as follows:

60 grams (morning) + 60 grams (evening) = 120 grams per day

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats eat 120 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

720 grams ÷ 120 grams per day = 6 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's figure out how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten = \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\)

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"To solve this, let's use some simple math. Let's say Donovan's part took \( x \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part would be \( x + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both parts is 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]
Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 80 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, would be:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast:** $200
2. **Doctor's visit cost:** The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \div 2 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of painkillers:** Each pill costs $4, and she gets 30 pills, so the total cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking cost:** The doctor charges $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so the total cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is **$482**."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. 

20% of 80 emails don't require any response:
20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails he does need to respond to each day:
80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day.

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"Let's break it down step by step:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: 64 classes
- Wednesday: 96 classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Total number of classes = \(32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\)

Let's do the addition:

\(32 + 64 = 96\)

\(96 + 96 = 192\)

\(192 + 30 = 222\)

\(222 + 25 = 247\)

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

2. Divide the total by the number of tests.

First, let's add up all the scores:
- John scored 100 on his first test.
- John scored 100 on his second test.
- John scored 100 on his third test.
- John scored 80 on his fourth test.

So, the total score is:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is:
\[ 95 \]"
"First, let's find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

To find 70% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, let's find out how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas.

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Now, we add the pizzas left by both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the final number of pizzas left is:
14"
"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony is sending. He wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones. Since he is sending 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so he had:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

6 × 4 = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the trucks had issues, we calculate:

20 trucks ÷ 4 = 5 trucks

So, 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser.

Now, we need to find out how many trucks successfully delivered the fertiliser:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

15 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 300 tons

**Final Answer: 300 tons**"
"Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter in total.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next half pound for free.

Let's calculate the cost:

1. For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's figure out how many people are actually coming to the party.

Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls from her dance class
- 13 family members

Total invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so:
45 - 4 = 41 people are coming to the party.

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 people. For each additional person, it costs $6.

The number of additional people is:
41 - 20 = 21 additional people

The cost for the additional people is:
21 * $6 = $126

So, the total cost is the rental fee plus the cost for the additional people:
$125 + $126 = $251

The final numerical answer is:
$251"
"First, let's find out how much money Maggie and Riza each had originally.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can find out how much she originally had by calculating:

\[ \text{Maggie's original money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80.

Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can find out how much she originally had by calculating:

\[ \text{Riza's original money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

So, the total amount of money they have left together is:

\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

"First, let's find out how many bananas all the monkeys eat in a day.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys:
\[ 10 + 14 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

This means the first two monkeys together eat 24 bananas each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
\[ 24 \times 7 = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for the week. So, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 147 \div 7 = 21 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Final answer:
\[ 21 \]"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he finished 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle.

750 pieces."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses.

Roses cost $2 each, so for 15 roses:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2 \text{ per rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, so she had:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the roses cost $30 and she only has $25, she needs more money. She is short by:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

To make up the $5, she needs to borrow or get more money. Since the florist can only give change in quarters, we need to find out how many quarters she will get as change if she pays with a $20 bill (since she can't pay with less than $30).

If she pays with a $20 bill and still needs $10 more, she will need to borrow or get $10 more. Assuming she borrows or gets the extra $10, she will pay $30 with a $20 bill and a $10 bill.

The florist will give her change in quarters. Since a quarter is worth $0.25, we need to find out how many quarters make up $10:
\[ \$10 \div \$0.25 = 40 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with:
\[ 40 \text{ quarters} \]

"Let's break down the timing step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves after 35 minutes (30 minutes after the first train leaves + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after Paul arrives (30 minutes after the first train leaves + 35 minutes after the second train leaves).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
   - Leaves after 65 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 85 minutes after Paul arrives (65 minutes + 20 minutes).

Paul arrives at the station 10 minutes before the first train, so he will wait for the fourth train to arrive.

The total waiting time for Paul is 85 minutes.

"First, let's find out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week and she has been doing this for 12 weeks.

So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach 200 toothpicks:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take her to save 80 more toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.

The original price of the watch is $2000. He bought it at 75% of its original price.

To find 75% of $2000, we do:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

To find 120% of $1500, we do:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for $1800.

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of $2000.

The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage discount is:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"First, let's figure out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours.

1 hour has 60 minutes, so 4 hours have:
4 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

Since a spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 240 minutes (which is 240 × 60 seconds), one spring would create:
240 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 14,400 jellyfish

Now, if we have 5 springs, each creating 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs would be:
5 springs × 14,400 jellyfish/spring = 72,000 jellyfish

So, the final numerical answer is:

180 + 15 = 195

So, Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since the total distance is 4 miles). Then he had to walk back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

If he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find out how long it took him by dividing the total distance by his speed.

Total distance walked = 4 miles
Speed = 4 miles per hour

Time taken = Total distance / Speed
Time taken = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
Time taken = 1 hour

So, it took him 1 hour to reach the store."

40 bananas * $0.80 per banana = $32.00

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:

10 bunches * $3.00 per bunch = $30.00

Finally, let's find out how much money Jenny saved:

$32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam gets \( x \) feet of the fence.
2. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry gets \( x + 60 \) feet.
3. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + (x + 60) = 100
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 60 = 100

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, each year it grows:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) Trekking bikes.

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes were BMX bikes.
   - So, \( 300 \times 0.15 = 45 \) BMX bikes.

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes were MTB.
   - So, \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \) MTB bikes.

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Each Trekking bike costs $450.
   - So, \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \) dollars.

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Each BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB, which is \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \) dollars.
   - So, \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \) dollars.

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Each MTB bike costs $500.
   - So, \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings to find the total amount Marcel earned.

- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \) dollars.

So, Marcel earned **$131,250** from selling bicycles during that month."

"First, let's figure out how many minutes John spends in classes each day.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 classes in total. Each class is 40 minutes long.

So, the total time spent in classes each day is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes each week is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days.

The total weekly minutes are 1600, so the extra learning time is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to find the total weekly learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 28.33 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find the height from which the ball bounces on its first bounce. Since the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the ball is dropped from:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

On the first bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

On the second bounce, the ball again reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height from the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10:

2000 apples ÷ 10 apples/bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags × $5/bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"Let's work backwards to find out how much meat was on the triceratops originally.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which was half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. So, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.

2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there were \(1080 \times 2 = 2160\) kilograms of meat.

Therefore, the triceratops originally had 2160 kilograms of meat."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many sodas are left after Ellen and her brother took some.

Ellen started with 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them and took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, the number of sodas left is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Next, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, the number of sodas left after her brother took some is:
\[ 11 - 1 - 2 = 8 \]

Out of these 8 sodas, 2 are unshaken (since Ellen took 1 unshaken soda and her brother took 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 3 unshaken - 1 = 2 unshaken sodas), and 3 are shaken (since Ellen shook 3 and her brother took 1, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas + the 1 unshaken she shook).

So, the total number of shaken sodas is 2, and the total number of sodas is 8. The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, expressed as a percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances each train has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's figure out how many days Billy is working. 

From March 1st to April 19th, there are 31 days in March and 19 days in April up to the 19th. So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, we need to find 20% of 50:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

This means Billy works on:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, the number of people he helps each day is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ people per day} \]

Therefore, the total number of people he helps over 40 days is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ people} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is:
480"
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. So, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. So, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

Time for the biggest slide = Length of the slide / Speed
\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

Time for the second biggest slide = Length of the slide / Speed
\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for the biggest slide} - \text{Time for the second biggest slide} \]
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

Each day, Bobby takes:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes

So, each day he spends:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

After 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

Final numerical answer:
5"
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

Micah's distance = 3.5 × Amber's distance
Micah's distance = 3.5 × 8 miles
Micah's distance = 28 miles

Now, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

Ahito's distance = Total distance - (Amber's distance + Micah's distance)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - (8 miles + 28 miles)
Ahito's distance = 52 miles - 36 miles
Ahito's distance = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the new balance after Sheila returned the item.

1. Initial charge: $85.00
2. Cost of the returned item: $15.00

Subtract the returned item from the initial charge:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount.

3. Original price of the frying pan: $20.00
4. Discount on the frying pan: 20% of $20.00
\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount.

5. Original price of the set of towels: $30.00
6. Discount on the set of towels: 10% of $30.00
\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Finally, add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the remaining balance after the return.

7. Remaining balance after return: $70.00
8. Cost of the frying pan: $16.00
9. Cost of the set of towels: $27.00

Add these amounts together:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[ \boxed{113.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( J \).

2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. So, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

5. To find \( J \), we solve the equation \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \):
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"First, we find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we calculate Caroline's age. Caroline is three times older than Ben, so:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Caroline is 24 years old."
"First, let's find out how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.

20% of $100,000 = 0.20 × $100,000 = $20,000

So, Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

Next, we need to find out how much she will have saved by the time she retires in 20 years.

$20,000 × 20 years = $400,000

Now, we need to find out how much she will need each year in retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.

40% of $100,000 = 0.40 × $100,000 = $40,000

So, she needs $40,000 each year in retirement.

Finally, we need to find out how many years she needs to work to save enough for her retirement needs. She needs $400,000 and saves $20,000 each year.

$400,000 ÷ $20,000 = 20 years

So, Lauren needs to work for 20 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to find out how long each of the 4 equal parts will be. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

100 ÷ 4 = 25

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.

Next, we need to divide each of these 25 centimeter parts into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

Each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. 

To find the total population, we can set up the equation:
\[ 40\% \text{ of total population} = 240 \]
\[ 0.40 \times \text{total population} = 240 \]

Now, we solve for the total population:
\[ \text{total population} = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ \text{total population} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

To find the number of girls:
\[ 60\% \text{ of total population} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360.

Final numerical answer:
360"
"First, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil:

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women.

First, let's calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

First, let's find out how many miles Soledad plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
- Miles per session = 125 miles
- Sessions per day = 2
- Total miles per day = 125 miles/session * 2 sessions/day = 250 miles/day

Now, let's calculate the total miles she would hike in 30 days if she hikes 250 miles each day:
- Total miles in 30 days = 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7,500 miles

So, to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her 9,300-mile journey:
- Additional miles needed = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles
- Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

**Final Answer: 60 miles per day**"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each color of ball:

- For the red balls: \(3 \text{ balls} \times \$9 \text{ per ball} = \$27\)
- For the blue balls: \(11 \text{ balls} \times \$5 \text{ per ball} = \$55\)
- For the green balls: \(25 \text{ balls} \times \$3 \text{ per ball} = \$75\)

Now, let's add up the total amount received from selling all the balls:

\(\$27 + \$55 + \$75 = \$157\)

So, the store will have received \$157 after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's find out how much Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of apples bought is 12 kg, and Pierre and Paul together want 7 kg. This means James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kg of apples left."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
   So, $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
   So, $32 - $5 = $27.
4. He then spends $19 on a puzzle.
   So, $27 - $19 = $8.

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's find out how much money Anna spent in total. She started with $16 and has $2 left. So, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that she had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we divide the total spent on the books by 2 to find the cost of each book:

\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

So, each book cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class.

This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To find out how many more students that is, we calculate 20% of 50.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more students this year compared to last year.

"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a simple proportion based on the given information.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how many minutes (\(x\)) it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\):
\[
255 \times x = 459 \times 5
\]

\[
255x = 2295
\]

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

**Final Answer:**
9 minutes"
"First, let's count the initial number of each type of fish:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's add the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, to find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"First, let's find out how long each person took to do their chores.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 9 \text{ hours} \]
(Note: We add 1 hour to ensure it's ""well over 4 hours."")

Now, let's add up the time for all three chores:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:
19 hours"
"First, let's figure out how many miles John drives one way to his parents' place. Since he drives at 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours, we can find the distance by multiplying the speed by the time:

\[ 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

This is the distance for one way. Since he makes a round trip, we need to double this distance:

\[ 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we need to multiply the round trip distance by 2 to find out how many miles he drives in a month:

\[ 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance in 7 days:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"First, let's calculate how many toys the first 4 workers produce in one hour.

- The first 2 workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next 2 workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, in one hour, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys.

Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means that \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys have been produced.

Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:

\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

"First, we need to find the weight of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory’s dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all the dogs together to find the total weight:
\[
60 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is:
\[
105 \text{ pounds}

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris, which means Luis had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so if Luis had 32 stickers, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's find out how many ounces of M&M John has in total. He buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many M&M are in those 30 ounces. Since 1 ounce contains 30 M&M, then 30 ounces will contain:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

Now, if John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"First, we need to find out how far half of the way around the earth is. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. So, half of the way around the earth would be:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car can go. Since the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, and the average car can go 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ miles per hour} = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how fast the fastest car can go. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ miles per hour} = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.
2. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

Let's say Sarah painted \( x \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( x + 12 \) eggs.

Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ x + (x + 12) = 30 \]
\[ 2x + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say Arnold and Madeline each painted \( y \) eggs.

The total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ y + y + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2y + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2y = 26 \]
\[ y = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

Final answer:
8"
"First, let's find out how many groups of crayons Nik can make. Since he has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8:

200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons/group = 25 groups

Now, since each group of crayons will be put into a box and each box weighs 8 ounces, we can find out the total weight of the boxes:

25 boxes × 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons × 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we can find the total weight in pounds by dividing the total ounces by 16:

400 ounces ÷ 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how much of the tree John can use to make logs. The tree is 80 feet tall, and he can use 80% of it. So, we calculate 80% of 80 feet:

\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood. We divide 64 by 4:

\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, for 16 logs, the total number of planks is:

\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount he makes is:

\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 and that is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

Valerie's brother's earnings = $5000 * 2 = $10000

Next, we need to find out how much their mother earns. Their mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. So, we first find their combined salary:

Combined salary of Valerie and her brother = $5000 + $10000 = $15000

Now, we calculate their mother's earnings:

Their mother's earnings = $15000 * 2 = $30000

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

Total earnings = Valerie's earnings + Brother's earnings + Mother's earnings
Total earnings = $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Grandma to walk on the beach and on the sidewalk.

We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and this covers 2 miles. 

Since the beach walking takes 40 minutes for 2 miles, we can find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach. We do this by dividing the time by the distance:

\[ \text{Time per mile on the beach} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 20 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we know that on the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed. This means it takes her half the time to walk the same distance. So, for 1 mile on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Time per mile on the sidewalk} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since the sidewalk part of the walk is 1 mile, it will take her 10 minutes to walk this part.

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and she has been saving for 8 weeks.

So, her total savings so far are:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach $60. We subtract her current savings from $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save $28, we divide $28 by $4:
\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
   \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds

2. Then, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
   \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds

3. Finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
   \(1 \times 3 = 3\) blue birds

Now, we add all the blue birds together:
\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if we subtract the 24 marbles he will receive from the total of 60 marbles, we can find out how many marbles he originally has.

60 - 24 = 36 marbles

This means Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles.

36 - 10 = 26 marbles

So, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
2. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
3. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water with 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the final temperature of the mixture in the bottle will be at least 40 degrees.

The formula to find the final temperature when mixing two different temperatures is:

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(\text{Amount of first liquid} \times \text{Temperature of first liquid}) + (\text{Amount of second liquid} \times \text{Temperature of second liquid})}{\text{Total amount of liquid}}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know the final temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how many cows and chickens are added over three weeks.

Three weeks have 21 days (since a week has 7 days).

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring:
20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring:
10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the initial numbers:

Initial cows: 50
Cows added: 420
Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Initial chickens: 20
Chickens added: 210
Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Now, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"First, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack has 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, we multiply 9 by 4:

9 bagels/pack × 4 packs = 36 bagels

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, and he orders 4 packs:

$10.00/pack × 4 packs = $40.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

So, the discount amount is $4.00. We subtract this from the total cost to find the final cost:

$40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Finally, to find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the final cost by the total number of bagels:

$36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel

Each single bagel will cost $1.00."
"First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The question says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. The question says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we have:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 3 scoops

To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 3 scoops = 1 potato per scoop

Now, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate, we multiply the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes per scoop:

18 scoops * 1 potato per scoop = 18 potatoes

So, Gomer ate 18 potatoes."
"First, let's find out how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Next, let's calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days. Chester increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, so:

5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make:

240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.

20 dozens"
"First, let's find out how many red jellybeans there are. Jess can see that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:

\[ 17 \times 2 = 34 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jellybeans are either green or red. We add the number of green and red jellybeans together:

\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find out how many blue jellybeans there are, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is:

30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

So, the final numerical answer is:
300 lemons"
"First, let's find out how many men and women were on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

The total number of passengers is 84. To find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents, we divide 84 by 14:
84 ÷ 14 = 6

This means each part of the ratio represents 6 passengers.

Now, to find the number of women initially on the bus, we multiply the number of parts for women (which is 9) by the value of each part (which is 6):
9 × 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
54 - 20 = 34

Final answer: 34 women have remained on the bus."
"First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the sunflower sales. He earns $26 from sunflowers each day. Since each sunflower costs $2, we divide the daily earnings from sunflowers by the cost of one sunflower:

\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers each day.

Next, let's find out how many sunflowers he sold from the bouquet sales. He earns $56 from bouquets each day, and each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. So, we need to find out how many sunflowers are in the bouquets he sold each day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we need to know how many bouquets he sold each day. We do this by dividing the daily earnings from bouquets by the cost of one bouquet:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, Faraday sells 7 bouquets each day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers from bouquets sold each day is:

\[ 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Now, we add the number of sunflowers sold from both sunflowers and bouquets each day:

\[ 13 + 84 = 97 \]

So, Faraday sells 97 sunflowers each day. To find out how many sunflowers he sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily sales by 3:

\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 291 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \text{ rocks} \times \$7 \text{ per rock} = \$84 \]

Adam's initial amount of money is $100. The money he has after selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between what he started with and what he ended up with.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scenes separately and then add them together.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for large-sized scenes = \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for medium-sized scenes = \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - Number of days for small-sized scenes = \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we add the days required for each size of picture scenes:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Chatty has four children, and she wants to distribute the eggs equally among them. So, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ eggs}}{4 \text{ children}} = 9 \text{ eggs per child} \]

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. 

First, we calculate the daily cost for all the fish:
3 fish * $1/fish = $3 per day

So, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles.
- So, the total distance is \(110 + 140 = 250\) miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
- Sid took 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
- So, the total time is \(2 + 3 = 5\) hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, we know the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. So, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 0.20 \times 3 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, we can find out how many Carlos collected by subtracting 5 from 27.

So, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, to find out how many seashells Carrey collected, we divide the number of seashells Carlos collected by 2.

So, Carrey collected:
\[ 22 \div 2 = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
\[ 27 \text{ (Jim)} + 22 \text{ (Carlos)} + 11 \text{ (Carrey)} = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally between themselves. Since there are 3 people, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.

So, each person gets:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. That's 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

So, in total, Mason eats 20 carrots from Monday to Friday and 10 carrots on the weekend.

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.

"The first song is 5 minutes long.

The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find out how much longer, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes.

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the time of the first song and the second song together:
5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"First, let's find out how much Linus sells one mobile device for. He buys it for $20 and sells it for twice the amount, so:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

So, he sells each device for $40.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue for the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

**Monday:**
- He bought 2 devices.
- Cost per device: $20.
- Total cost for Monday: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

**Tuesday:**
- He bought 4 devices.
- Cost per device: $20.
- Total cost for Tuesday: \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

So, the total cost for all the devices he bought is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the devices.

**Monday:**
- He sold 2 devices.
- Selling price per device: $40.
- Total revenue for Monday: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \).

**Tuesday:**
- He sold 4 devices.
- Selling price per device: $40.
- Total revenue for Tuesday: \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

So, the total revenue from selling all the devices is:
\[ 80 + 160 = 240 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \]

So, the profit Linus earned is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet
Ned's height = 5 feet

Now, we know Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we can find Carl's height by adding one foot to Ned's height:

Ned's height = 5 feet
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot
Carl's height = 6 feet

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, to find the length of Carl's cane, we divide Carl's height by 2:

Carl's height = 6 feet
Length of Carl's cane = Carl's height / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 6 feet / 2
Length of Carl's cane = 3 feet

So, the final answer is 3 feet."
"First, let's find out how many bottles of juice are needed to cover 100% of the daily energy needs for 1 person. Since 1 bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we need:

\[ \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles} \]

This means 5 bottles are needed for 1 person's daily energy needs.

Now, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed would be:

\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles a day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the number of bottles they produce from the total number needed:

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

**Final Answer: 7300**"
"First, let's figure out how many octuplets are dressed in each color:

- Total octuplets: 8
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:

- Blue-wearers with bows: \( 2 \times \frac{1}{1} = 2 \) (since all blue-wearers wear bows)
- Purple-wearers with bows: \( 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \)

Now, we add the number of blue and purple wearers who wear bows:

- Total with bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

Out of these 4, 2 are wearing purple. So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

\[ \frac{2}{4} \times 100 = 50\% \]

Final answer:
50%"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Reports Received**: 5168
2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: 1907
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: 2136

First, we add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday:
\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Next, we subtract this total from the overall total reports received:
\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{1125} \]"
"First, let's find out how much land Abraham sold for $50. He sold half of his 80 square meters, so:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

Next, we need to find out how much land he sold for $30. He sold another 1/4 of his land, so:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

Now, let's calculate the remaining land after these sales. He originally had 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters for $50, and then sold another 20 square meters for $30. So, the remaining land is:

\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, so the money from this sale is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \]

So, the final amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, we find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is:

26 ÷ 2 = 13

Now, Geb is 10 less than this amount, so we subtract 10 from 13:

13 - 10 = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, he uses:

2 masks/go out * 3 times/day = 6 masks/day

Final numerical answer:
12"
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the original number of eggs hidden: \(36 - 27 = 9\).

So, the final number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:

200 apartments + 200 apartments = 400 apartments

The third complex is 60% bigger than these 400 apartments. To find 60% of 400:

60% of 400 = 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments

So, the third complex has:

400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments

Now, let's add up all the apartments in the three complexes:

200 apartments + 200 apartments + 640 apartments = 1040 apartments

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections in a week is:

1040 apartments * 3 collections per apartment = 3120 collections

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total money he makes in a week is:

3120 collections * $0.40 per collection = $1248

So, John makes $1248 in a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced each year:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: 800 fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these together, we get:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2550\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2550}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and she gave Jack 1/5 of it.

To find 1/5 of $100, we divide $100 by 5:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the length of the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.

So, we can write the equation for the total length as:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( B \):
\[ 4B + B + B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B = 37 - 7 \]
\[ 6B = 30 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

So, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. Now, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ \text{Length of the red rope} = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"First, let's find out how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 4/5 \) of her original money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to his little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Half of the mural is yellow, so that means 6 pints are yellow.

This leaves 12 - 6 = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple paint.

Since the red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3.

So, 6 ÷ 3 = 2 pints of red paint.

**Final Answer:**
2 pints of red paint were used."
"First, let's find the area of one bedroom. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. So, for one bedroom:

\[ \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ \text{Total area of bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 960 \, \text{square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:

\[ \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \, \text{square feet} = 1200 \, \text{square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \, \text{square feet} + 1200 \, \text{square feet} + 1000 \, \text{square feet} = 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \, \text{square feet} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted from Monday to Friday, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
20% of 100 = 0.20 × 100 = 20 pods

So, the special size box has:
100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

The special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. We want to know how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 if we use 1 pod per cycle.

First, find out how many pods you get for $1 in the special size box:
$12 ÷ 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Now, for $1, you can buy:
$1 ÷ $0.10 per pod = 10 pods

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount used to pay the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his remaining money.
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Finally, Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first half:
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. In the second half:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A's total goals: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Team B's total goals: \(2 + 8 = 10\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

Final numerical answer:
16"
"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. 

First, let's find out how much chalk he used on Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times 45\% = 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

So, after Monday, the chalk left is:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. Let's see how much chalk he uses each day:
\[ 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 20\% = 2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches} \]

Now, let's see how many days he can use the chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to less than 2 inches, using 0.55 inches each day.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2.75 - 0.55 \times \text{number of days} < 2 \]

Solving for the number of days:
\[ 2.75 - 2 < 0.55 \times \text{number of days} \]
\[ 0.75 < 0.55 \times \text{number of days} \]
\[ \text{number of days} > \frac{0.75}{0.55} \]
\[ \text{number of days} > 1.36 \]

Since the number of days must be a whole number, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more full day before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has \(\boxed{1}\) day before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out the total number of students on varsity:

\[ 4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[ 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's find out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so:

Drilled teeth: 4
Capped teeth: 4 + 7 = 11

Now, let's add the drilled and capped teeth to find out the total number of teeth fixed:

Fixed teeth = Drilled teeth + Capped teeth
Fixed teeth = 4 + 11 = 15

Now, to find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Fixed teeth}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, we need to find out how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus returned 1600 gallons of milk.

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the refund for 1600 gallons would be:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. In 7 years, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old.
3. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years, so Wendy's current age is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Now, let's look at the second part of the problem:
4. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
5. At that time, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5 \times (C + 7) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3} (C + 7) \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that 100 books cost $500. 

To find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books with $27000. This means he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Now, Bob distributes these books between 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, Bob can buy 1800 books per school.

   - He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all of the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he added 4 more apples to his pocket.
- After the second action, he added 4 more apples to his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

"First, let's figure out how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Since Kate has 6 friends, we multiply the number of slices each friend eats by 6.

For cheese pizza:
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

For pepperoni pizza:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now, we need to find out how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are needed.

For cheese pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

For pepperoni pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas

So, Kate needs to buy:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour.
2. In 15 minutes (which is a quarter of an hour), he builds 20 ÷ 4 = 5 snowballs.
3. In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
4. So, the net gain in 15 minutes is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to get to 60 snowballs:

5. If Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to get to 60 snowballs.
6. 60 ÷ 3 = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by 15 minutes:

7. 20 intervals × 15 minutes = 300 minutes.

So, it will take 300 minutes for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have negative bandages, this means they needed 16 more bandages to meet the usage, so they ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they got \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left.
   - This means we need to adjust our initial count. If they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and they used 25 bandages on the third day, then before using those 25 bandages, they had \(78 + 25 = 103\) bandages.
   - Before ordering the two bulk packs on the third day, they had \(103 - 100 = 3\) bandages.
   - Before the second day, they had \(34 + 16 = 50\) bandages (since they needed 16 more to meet the usage on the second day).
   - Before the first day, they had \(50 + 38 = 88\) bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{88}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much hair was cut off. May's hair went from 10 inches to 8 inches, so we subtract:

10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches

Next, we calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost is $30 per inch, and 2 inches were cut:

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Now, we add the cost of the color, which is $40:

$60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100

So, the final cost for May's cut and color is $100."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week.
So, \( 7.5 \times 6 = 45 \) hours a week.

Now, let's calculate how many hours she works in April. Since April has exactly 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly hours by 4:

\( 45 \times 4 = 180 \) hours in April.

Next, we calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, so for 180 hours, she earns:
\( 180 \times 1.5 = 270 \) dollars.

Since Jen had complete attendance in April, she also receives an additional $10:

So, her total earnings for April are:
\( 270 + 10 = 280 \) dollars.

**Final Answer: 280**"
"Let's calculate how much money Jason earned for each task over the two-week period:

1. For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, at $0.50 each time:
   \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \)

2. For doing his laundry once, at $3.00:
   \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \)

3. For taking the trash to the curb twice, at $0.75 each time:
   \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \)

4. For cleaning his room once, at $1.50:
   \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \)

Now, let's add all the amounts together to find out how much money Jason earned in total:
\( 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \)

So, the final amount of money Jason earned is:
$9.00"
"First, we need to find out how much blood a shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

So, a shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ 1200 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 40 * 2 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is 50 * 3 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"First, let's find out how many red pens Alain's mom bought. She bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

Next, we know that she bought twice the amount of black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

So, Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's find out the cost of one bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so:

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. Since he bought 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than scotch. So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's add up all the trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, and it will be shared equally among the 3 people. So, each person will get:

"To find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's say the number of coffee mugs is \( x \).

According to the problem, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40."" This can be written as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \).

First, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes.

So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

This means 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:
\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

This means 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:
\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 42 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:

- Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
- She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is: \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Next, let's account for the colors stolen and used up:

- Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors: \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
- Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors: \(6 \div 2 = 3\) colors used, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors left from that set.

Now, let's calculate the total number of colors left:

- The two palettes left have \(4 + 4 = 8\) colors.
- The two full makeup sets have \(2 \times 6 = 12\) colors.
- The one partial makeup set has 3 colors.

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is: \(8 + 12 + 3 = 23\).

"First, let's find out how high Mattison's two-story house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the first floor to the ceiling is. Since it is thrice as high as Mattison, we have:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we need to subtract the height of the first floor to the ceiling from the total height of the house. So, we do:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:

\[ 240 \text{ inches} \]"
"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of 700 shells.

40% of 700 = 0.40 × 700 = 280 shells

Now, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells.

700 - 280 = 420 shells

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.

60% of 420 = 0.60 × 420 = 252 shells

Finally, we subtract the shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

420 - 252 = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

168"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles all dogs need to walk per day.
2. Subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total to find out how many miles the last dog needs.

First, we know the average miles per day for all 4 dogs is 3 miles. So, the total miles for all 4 dogs is:
\[ 4 \text{ dogs} \times 3 \text{ miles/dog} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles the first three dogs need:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The final answer is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much John got from the loan. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

To find 40% of $250,000, we do:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, John got a loan worth $100,000.

Next, John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. To find out how much that is, we calculate 60% of $100,000:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, John used $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he had leftover, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying his debts."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. We do this by adding the weights of the three tunas together:

56 kilograms + 46 kilograms + 26 kilograms = 128 kilograms

Next, we need to calculate how much Deandre will earn by selling all the tunas. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we multiply the total weight of the tunas by the price per kilogram:

128 kilograms × $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"First, we need to find out the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

To find the selling price, we calculate:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we need to find the profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's find out how much water each setting removes per day:
- Low setting removes 1 liter per day.
- Medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
- High setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed for each setting:
- For the low setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days, so it removed \(1 \times 3 = 3\) liters.
- For the medium setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days, so it removed \(2 \times 3 = 6\) liters.
- For the high setting, Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days, so it removed \(4 \times 5 = 20\) liters.

Finally, let's add up all the water removed:
- Total water removed = \(3 + 6 + 20 = 29\) liters.

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. So, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, they threw 288 balloons."
"First, let's find out how much medicine Saanvi uses for one dose.

For one dose:
- She uses 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She uses 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, for one dose, the total amount of medicine is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
448 mL"
"First, we need to find the capacity of one of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has 120 students, we calculate:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity for John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school to find the combined capacity:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the interest Stephen has to pay. The interest is 2% of $300.

Interest = 2% of $300
Interest = 0.02 * $300
Interest = $6

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is the original $300 plus the interest of $6, which equals $306.

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid in the first 11 months. He pays $25 each month for 11 months.

Total paid in 11 months = $25 * 11
Total paid in 11 months = $275

Now, we subtract the amount paid in 11 months from the total amount he needs to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = Total amount - Amount paid in 11 months
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $306 - $275
Amount to be paid in the twelfth month = $31

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"First, let's find out how many diapers are changed by the children in total each day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[5 \times 2 = 10\]

This means 10 diapers are changed each day by the children.

Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers. So, we need to find half of 10:

\[10 \div 2 = 5\]

This means Jordan's wife changes 5 diapers each day.

Since Jordan changes the other half, Jordan also changes 5 diapers each day.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[5\]"
"To find out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:** 20
2. **People entering at the first stop:** 40
   - Total people on the bus after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\)
3. **People entering at the second stop:** \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\)
   - Total people on the bus after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\)
4. **People entering at the third stop:** The number of passengers doubled, so \(90 \times 2 = 180\)
   - Total people on the bus after the third stop: \(90 + 180 = 270\)

Since the bus can only hold 200 people, we need to find out how many people are over the bus's capacity:
- Over capacity: \(270 - 200 = 70\)

So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{0}\)."
"First, let's find out how much Pauline spent in the first 5 years.

Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost for one year is:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times \$2/\text{visit} = \$6/\text{year} \]

For 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times \$6/\text{year} = \$30 \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new cost is:
\[ \$2 + (150\% \times \$2) = \$2 + (1.5 \times \$2) = \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

Pauline continued to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new cost of $5 per visit. So, the cost for 3 years is:
\[ 3 \text{ years} \times \$5/\text{year} = \$15 \]

Adding the cost of the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent is:
\[ \$30 + \$15 = \$45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$45 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many students can try the escape room in total. There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who can try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:

4 grades × 10 students/grade = 40 students

Now, we know that only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, and each group gets 45 minutes. To find out how long it will take for all 40 students to try the escape room, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try the escape room at a time:

40 students ÷ 8 students/group = 5 groups

Since each group takes 45 minutes, and there are 5 groups, the total time needed is:

5 groups × 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"First, we calculate the total cost for the wooden tables:
4 tables × $20/table = $80

Next, we calculate the total cost for the roof frames:
2 frames × $10/frame = $20

So, Ali has to pay John $100."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into simple steps:

1. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is \( x \) feet.
2. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.
3. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is \( x + 4x = 5x \).
4. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can write the equation \( 5x = 40 \).
5. To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5: \( x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \).
6. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \), so we substitute \( x = 8 \) into this: \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

So, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"First, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs.

Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Now, for every pound of ground beef, Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

2 tablespoons/pound × 5 pounds = 10 tablespoons

Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning."
"First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we can calculate the total width by multiplying the number of windows by the width of each window:

5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches

Now, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So we multiply the total width by 2:

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To solve this, we need to break the call into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   - So, for 16 minutes, the cost is \(16 \times 0.25 = 4\) dollars.

2. The call lasts 36 minutes in total, so the remaining time is \(36 - 16 = 20\) minutes.
   - For these 20 minutes, the cost is $0.20 per minute.
   - So, for 20 minutes, the cost is \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\) dollars.

3. Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
   - Total cost = \(4 + 4 = 8\) dollars.

So, a 36-minute call would cost **8 dollars**."

1. Find out how much it rained on Monday.
2. Calculate twice the amount of rain from Monday.
3. Add 1 more inch to that amount to get the expected rain on Tuesday.

Step 1: It rained 2 inches on Monday.

Step 2: Twice the amount of rain from Monday is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.

Step 3: Add 1 more inch to the amount from step 2: \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

So, the expected rain on Tuesday is 5 inches.

**Final Answer:**
5 inches"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is \( C \).
2. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies \( B \) she makes is \( 3C - 2 \).

Next, we need to find out how many treats Carly has in total. Each of the 5 people in her class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

We already know that \( B = 3C - 2 \), so we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. The discount is 20% off for getting both.

To find the discount amount for each service:
- For the manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
- For the pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)

Now, subtract the discount from each service:
- The discounted cost of the manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)
- The discounted cost of the pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

Next, add the costs of the discounted manicure and pedicure:
- Total cost for both: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)

Now, let's calculate the cost of adding nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (5 on each hand).

The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so for 10 nails on each hand:
- Cost for one hand: \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \)
- Cost for both hands: \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \)

Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the total cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure:
- Total cost: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

So, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"First, let's figure out how many issues Susan gets from each magazine type.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
   - Each of these magazines sends 12 issues a year.
   - So, 3 magazines * 12 issues = 36 issues.

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   - This magazine sends 6 issues a year.

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   - The 6 issue magazine sends 6 issues.
   - So, 4 times 6 issues = 24 issues.

Now, let's add up all the issues:
- 36 issues (from the 3 magazines) + 6 issues (from the 1 magazine) + 24 issues (from the last magazine) = 66 issues.

So, Susan gets 66 issues every year. 

The final numerical answer is:
66"
"Samantha has 27 paintings.

Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"First, let's find out the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means we add 80% of $40 to the original price.

80% of $40 is calculated as:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means we take 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

50% of $72 is calculated as:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price in January after the decrease is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the standard lessons. He has 4 lessons at $80 each.

4 lessons × $80/lesson = $320

Next, we need to find out how much he charges for lessons with a veteran. He reduces his rate by 25%, so he charges 75% of $80.

75% of $80 = 0.75 × $80 = $60

Now, let's calculate the amount he makes from the 2 veteran lessons.

2 lessons × $60/lesson = $120

Finally, we add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons to find the total amount he makes for the day.

$320 + $120 = $440

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all the scores:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we count the number of quizzes:
There are 9 quizzes.

Next, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

First, let's find out how many pomelos Eve has left:
1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find 25% of 36:

\[ 25\% \times 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister.

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received:

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 81 \]"
"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

We know that 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the total number of novels she has written this year. Let's call the total number of novels she has written this year \( x \).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ \frac{3}{4}x = 9 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \), which is \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer:
12"
"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Find out what percentage this distance is of the total distance between Alaska and Texas.

First, let's calculate the distance Michael travels in 3 days. He travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. If we assume he drives for 24 hours each day (not including stops), then:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

For 3 days, the total distance is:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage 3600 km is of the total distance between Alaska and Texas, which is 6000 km.

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 60\% \]"
"First, let's find out how many grapes Madeline's brother used. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we can calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were used to make the pies. Since each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes and their mother made 4 pies, we can calculate:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, we can add up all the grapes used:

- Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6 grapes
- Grapes used by her brother: 30 grapes
- Grapes used for pies: 48 grapes

Adding these together:

\[ 6 + 30 + 48 = 84 \text{ grapes} \]

So, there were **84 grapes** at the beginning."
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School, which is 82.
2. Subtract the number of teachers who were sick, which is 13.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers called in, which is 9.

So, the calculation is:

\[ 82 - 13 + 9 \]

First, subtract 13 from 82:

\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Then, add 9 to 69:

\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the final number of teachers at school that day is:

78"
"First, let's find out how much Bud spends on cheese each week. He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount on gruyere cheese, which means he spends $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 on gruyere cheese.

So, the total amount spent on cheese each week is $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyere) = $9.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the pasta. The pasta costs $1.00 a box.

So, the total cost for making macaroni and cheese each week is $9.00 (cheese) + $1.00 (pasta) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, in one year (52 weeks), he spends $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

**Final Answer:**
$520.00"
"First, let's find out how many minutes the custodian has each day to clean classrooms. An 8-hour day is the same as 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how many minutes in total the custodian will spend cleaning all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, for 80 classrooms, it will take 15 x 80 = 1200 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to clean all 80 classrooms. Since the custodian can only clean for 480 minutes each day, we divide the total cleaning time by the daily available time: 1200 / 480 = 2.5 days. This means it will take 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms.

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean, and it will take 2.5 days to clean all the classrooms, we can calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning. The custodian will spend 480 minutes cleaning each day, and since 1200 minutes are needed in total, the daily cleaning time is 480 minutes.

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent cleaning each day}}{\text{Total available time each day}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, the percentage is:
\[ \left( \frac{480}{480} \right) \times 100 = 100\% \]

But since the custodian only needs 2.5 days to clean, we need to find the percentage of the day spent cleaning over the 5 days available. The custodian will spend 2.5 out of 5 days cleaning, so the percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{2.5}{5} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"First, let's figure out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- One bookcase has 3 shelves: 2 middle shelves and 1 bottom shelf.
- So, one bookcase can hold \(10 + 10 + 20 = 40\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

- \(110 \div 40 = 2.75\)

Since Elly can't have a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the next whole number. This means she needs 3 bookcases to hold all 110 books.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's find out how many eggs Rose bought. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens would be:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought the eggs at $2.40 per dozen, so for five dozens, the cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's figure out how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she sells each set for $1, her total earnings will be:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 8 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we can calculate this as:

100 hats / 2 = 50 red hats

Now, we know that there are 100 hats in total, and 50 of them are red. So, the remaining hats are:

100 hats - 50 red hats = 50 hats

Out of these remaining 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

3/5 * 50 hats = 30 blue hats

The rest of the hats are white. To find out how many white hats there are, we subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:

100 hats - 50 red hats - 30 blue hats = 20 white hats

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"First, let's find out how much one bag of beef jerky costs with the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount, so:

\[ $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 \]

Now, we know that one bag costs $15.00 and contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{$15.00}{30 \text{ sticks}} = $0.50 \text{ per stick} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, and $0.50 is equal to 50 cents, the cost per stick of jerky is:

50 cents

So, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"First, let's find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions is 70 from the first test plus 40 from the second test, which equals 110 questions.

To find 70% of 110:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to move on to 7th grade.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. She got 60% of 70 questions correct:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \).
2. The number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).
3. The total number of cubes is \( S + (5S - 4) = 116 \).

Now, let's solve for \( S \):

\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 116 + 4 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 120 / 6 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5 \times 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To find out the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of games she has played in four years.
2. Multiply the total number of games by the points she scores in each game.

First, let's find out the total number of games she has played in four years. She plays 40 games every year, so in four years, she would have played:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we know that she scores 21 points in each game. So, to find the total points, we multiply the total number of games by the points per game:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:

"First, let's figure out how many doughnuts Derrick makes every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen doughnuts equal \(10 \times 12 = 120\) doughnuts.

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. So, the money made from selling 120 doughnuts in a day is \(120 \times 2 = 240\) dollars.

Now, June typically has 30 days. If Derrick sells all his doughnuts every day, the total money made in June is \(240 \times 30 = 7200\) dollars.

So, Derrick makes **7200 dollars** in June."
"First, we need to find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day. She uploads 6 batches each day, and each batch has 7 photos. So, in one day, she uploads:

\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ 210 \text{ photos} \div 42 \text{ photos/day} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning each week.

- For the blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00\)
- For the pants: \(2 \text{ pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00\)
- For the skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total weekly cost:
\[ \$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00 \]

This is the amount Alicia spends each week. To find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[ \$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00 \]

So, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's find out John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, he is 2.5 times faster.

So, his new speed is:
\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

So, the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

The time required is:
\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, 20 more people were there than on the first day, so:
50 (first day) + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day, so:
2 * 70 (second day) = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. There are 4 days in this period, so:
60 (average per day) * 4 (days) = 240 people.

Now, we add up all the people Conor saw each day of the week:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 460 people.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 460."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: Three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: Four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the previous total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

For the extra gallon that is twice as tart, he needs 2 * 1 cup = 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 * 6 lemons = 36 lemons.

**Final Answer: 36**"
"First, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

For the German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds × 5 kilograms per German Shepherd = 15 kilograms per day

For the Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs × 3 kilograms per Bulldog = 6 kilograms per day

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both types of dogs:
15 kilograms (German Shepherds) + 6 kilograms (Bulldogs) = 21 kilograms per day

To find out how much food they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
21 kilograms per day × 7 days = 147 kilograms

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's find out how many legs all the 2-legged animals have. Since there are 10 of them and each has 2 legs, we multiply 10 by 2:

10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

Next, we calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals. There are 15 of them, and each has 4 legs, so we multiply 15 by 4:

15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, we add the number of legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs on the farm:

20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

So, the total number of legs on the farm is 80.

Final numerical answer:
80"
"First, let's figure out how many yellow blocks there are. Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as follows:

Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4
Number of yellow blocks = 8

Now, we know there are 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks, which makes a total of:

Total blue and yellow blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks
Total blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8
Total blue and yellow blocks = 12

Since the tower has 32 blocks in total, we can find out how many red blocks there are by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:

Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Total blue and yellow blocks
Number of red blocks = 32 - 12
Number of red blocks = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled west:**
   - Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Calculate the distance traveled east:**
   - Elvis then drives east for 8 hours at 18 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Determine the net distance from the starting point:**
   - Elvis first travels 90 miles west and then 144 miles east.
   - Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
   - Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find out how much the boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"First, let's find out how many orange and yellow candies there are.

- The number of red candies is 54.
- The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's \(54 \times 2 = 108\).
- The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so that's \(54 \div 2 = 27\).

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: 108
- Yellow candies: 27

Total of red, orange, and yellow candies: \(54 + 108 + 27 = 189\)

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

- Total candies: 232
- Total of red, orange, and yellow candies: 189

So, the number of pink candies is \(232 - 189 = 43\).

**Final Answer: 43**"
"First, let's find out how much Helen paid for the hotel. She stayed for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. So, the total cost for the hotel is:

3 nights × $80/night = $240

Next, let's calculate the cost of one bus trip. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:

10% of $80 = 0.10 × $80 = $8

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:

7 trips × $8/trip = $56

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:

$240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296

So, Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during that trip."
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas has after not dropping any. Since Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, we add those 4 marbles back to his total:

21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

This means Dallas originally received 25 marbles from Mazie.

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. If she gave 25 marbles to Dallas, we can find out how many she gave to Darla by subtracting the number of marbles given to Dallas from the total number of marbles Mazie had:

52 marbles - 25 marbles = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave Darla 27 marbles.

The final numerical answer is:
27"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets. 

The cost for the adult ticket is $12. Since there are 2 parents, the total cost for the adult tickets is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the child ticket is $8. Since there is 1 child, the total cost for the child ticket is:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns. Each popcorn costs $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 24 \text{ (adult tickets)} + 8 \text{ (child ticket)} + 6 \text{ (popcorns)} = 38 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount they pay is:
\[ 38 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.

The car weighs 1200 pounds.
The luggage weighs 250 pounds.
Each child weighs 75 pounds, and there are two children, so the total weight of the children is \(75 \times 2 = 150\) pounds.

Now, we add all these weights together:
\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force needed to push the car. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:
\[ 1600 \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper."
"First, we need to find Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and she is 16 years younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add Mia's age and Emma's age together and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

The final numerical answer is 48."

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle."
"First, let's find out how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so all together they eat:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, let's calculate how much feed they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 20 \text{ pounds} \]"
"First, let's find out how many hot dogs John needs in total. He invited 20 people and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, we multiply 20 by 2:

20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs

John already has 4 hot dogs, so we subtract those from the total needed:

40 hot dogs - 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number in each pack:

36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs

Each pack costs $2, so to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:

6 packs * $2/pack = $12

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs."

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. 

Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 50% = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. 

The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

- The discount on the shoes is $40 * 40% = $16.
- So, the price Jake pays for the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."

Now, add these costs to find the total cost for one jar:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Next, find the profit for one jar by subtracting the cost from the selling price:
$50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6

Finally, calculate the profit for 10 jars:
$6 (profit per jar) × 10 jars = $60

So, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is $60."
"First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- Quarters: 32 quarters × $0.25 = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes × $0.10 = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels × $0.05 = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies × $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add up the total value:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's add up all the money Janet spent:

1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets (2 tickets at $7.50 each): \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00\]

Janet spent a total of $27.00.

Now, let's subtract the total amount spent from the money her parents gave her:

\[40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00\]

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open:

- Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

That's 5 days a week.

Now, let's calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services:

3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week

Josh gets paid $4 per car, so in one week he makes:

15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week

For 2 weeks, he would make:

$60/week * 2 weeks = $120

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."

"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. If he sells half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each, we can calculate the total money he would earn as follows:

1. Half of 12 is 6, so he has 6 toy soldiers to sell at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers to sell at $7 each.
2. For the 6 toy soldiers at $5 each: \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.
3. For the 6 toy soldiers at $7 each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) dollars.
4. Adding these amounts together: \(30 + 42 = 72\) dollars.

So, Matthew would earn **72 dollars**."
"First, let's find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days.

So, \(6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\).

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes, but the dog keeps digging new ones. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes a day. So, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\(9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}\).

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day.

So, \(84 \text{ holes} \div 3 \text{ holes/day} = 28 \text{ days}\).

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert 28 days into weeks:

\(28 \text{ days} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 4 \text{ weeks}\).

**Final Answer: 4 weeks**"
"First, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average. Since Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of students at Norman High School by 3/4.

Norman High School's average enrollment = 4000 students

Butler High School's average enrollment = 4000 students * 3/4

Now, let's do the multiplication:

Butler High School's average enrollment = 4000 * 3/4 = 4000 * 0.75 = 3000 students

Next, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the average enrollment of Butler High School from the average enrollment of Norman High School.

Difference in enrollment = Norman High School's enrollment - Butler High School's enrollment

Difference in enrollment = 4000 students - 3000 students = 1000 students

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies is 7995.
The number of rainbow cookies is 2595.
The number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
2595 (rainbow cookies) + 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 5670

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
7995 (total cookies) - 5670 (rainbow and oatmeal cookies) = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers, but some were lost, so let's call the number of beakers he actually brought \( x \)

3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since he was supposed to bring 7 beakers, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - 5 = 2
\]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's find out how many legs James needs in total for the 4 tables. Since each table has 4 legs, we multiply 4 tables by 4 legs per table:

4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs

Next, we need to find out how many screws are needed for all the legs. Since each leg needs 2 screws, we multiply the number of legs by the number of screws per leg:

16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws

James has 40 screws in total. To find out how many screws he will have left over after using 32 screws, we subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws:

40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"First, we need to find out how many eggs are in the second basket. Since it has twice as many eggs as the first basket, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

The first basket has 10 eggs, so:
10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket.

Now, to find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:
10 eggs + 20 eggs = 30 eggs.

So, the final numerical answer is:
30"
"First, let's find out how much money each person raised:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

Total money raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"First, let's understand the information given:

- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran 2 miles.
- Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
- Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it means that for the same distance, Vanessa would take twice as long as Aaron. 

So, if Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, Vanessa would take:
\[ 16 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her 4 miles.

**32**"
"First, we need to find out how much line is needed for the 200 feet of dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, we multiply 200 feet by 3:

200 feet of dock * 3 feet of line per foot of dock = 600 feet of line needed.

Now, we know he already has 6 feet of new line. So, we subtract the line he already has from the total line needed:

600 feet of line needed - 6 feet of line he has = 594 feet of line he needs to buy.

So, he needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"First, let's figure out how much they make in one night from one table. They order 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the cost per table per night is:

2 meals * $5/meal + $5 for wine = $10 + $5 = $15

Now, since they get 6 reservations a night, the total for the night is:

6 tables * $15/table = $90

If they are open 2 days a week, then the weekly income is:

2 days/week * $90/day = $180

So, the final numerical answer is:

$180"
"First, we need to find out how much the vendor made from selling each watermelon. 

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price for each watermelon is:
\[ \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.

25% of $1.60 is:
\[ 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \]

So, the selling price for each watermelon is:
\[ 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's find out Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

James is twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to find out how old John's youngest son is. John had his youngest son when he was 32, and the problem does not specify when James was born, but we know the ages of the children now. Since James is 18, and he was born when John was 19, John is currently:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many oranges each person can peel in an hour.

An hour has 60 minutes.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, she can peel:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes. So, in 60 minutes, she can peel:
\[ \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peels from the number of oranges Ana peels:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's find out how much Mark paid for the radiator after the discount.

The original cost of the radiator is $400. He gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

To find 20% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80 after the discount.

Next, let's calculate the cost for hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's use some simple math.

1. Chickens have 2 legs each.
2. Cows have 4 legs each.
3. Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total.
4. The animals together have 70 legs.

Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).

We know:
- \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
- \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

From the first equation, we can say \( K = 20 - C \).

Now, substitute \( K \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + 4(20 - C) = 70 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2C + 80 - 4C = 70 \]
\[ -2C + 80 = 70 \]
\[ -2C = 70 - 80 \]
\[ -2C = -10 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm."
"First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, we multiply 7 by 8:

7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Now, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends. That makes a total of 4 people:

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
