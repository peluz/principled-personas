"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet uses. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs she has left to sell:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs each day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

So, in total, it takes:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts.

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (initial purchase price plus repairs) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The initial purchase price of the house is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. Therefore, the new value of the house is the original value plus 150% of the original value.

The increase in value due to repairs is:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Thus, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ 540 \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and the afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the cost of the first glass and the discounted cost of the second glass.
   - The cost of the first glass is $5.
   - The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.

2. Determine the pattern for the cost of the glasses.
   - The cost of the glasses will alternate between $5 and $3.
   - For 16 glasses, there will be 8 glasses at $5 and 8 glasses at $3.

3. Calculate the total cost.
   - The total cost for the 8 glasses at $5 is \(8 \times 5 = 40\) dollars.
   - The total cost for the 8 glasses at $3 is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is \(40 + 24 = 64\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]"
"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let the number of sheep in Seattle be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
3. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is \( 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

Then, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
4. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \( 2 \times \text{(number of sheep in Charleston)} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

Finally, we find the total number of sheep in all three cities:
5. The total number of sheep is the sum of the sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, which is \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

Thus, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the total size of the file and the point where the download restarts:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of the file is \( 200 \times 0.40 = 80 \) GB.

2. **Determine the time taken to download 80 GB:**
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - Time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time for the first 80 GB and the restart:**
   - Total time for the first 80 GB and the restart is \( 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Determine the remaining size of the file after the restart:**
   - The remaining size is \( 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \).

6. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   - Time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \).

7. **Add the time for the second download:**
   - Total time for the second download is 60 minutes.

8. **Calculate the total time for the entire download:**
   - Total time is \( 60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \).

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time he has is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph), so the remaining time is:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} - 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \]
The distance he covers in this remaining time at 80 mph is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we sum up the distances he has covered towards home:
\[ 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially drove 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for the additional hours worked.

1. **Calculate the regular pay:**
   - Regular hourly rate: $10
   - Regular hours worked: 40
   - Regular pay = Regular hourly rate × Regular hours worked
   \[
   \text{Regular pay} = 10 \times 40 = 400
   \]

2. **Calculate the overtime pay:**
   - Overtime hours worked: 45 - 40 = 5
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate
   - Overtime hourly rate = 1.2 × $10 = $12
   - Overtime pay = Overtime hourly rate × Overtime hours worked
   \[
   \text{Overtime pay} = 12 \times 5 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 400 + 60 = 460
   \]

Thus, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - (0.30 \times 180) = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[
   \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen donuts is $68.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the donuts is:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} \times 68 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 204 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Mini Cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cupcakes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dozen} \times 80 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 160 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the mini cheesecakes is:
     \[
     6 \text{ dozen} \times 55 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 330 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the pastries:
\[
204 \text{ dollars} + 160 \text{ dollars} + 330 \text{ dollars} = 694 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[
\boxed{694}
\]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit each year is the revenue from selling lemons minus the annual expenses:
\[
\text{Net profit per year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
\]

Next, we need to find the number of years \( n \) it will take for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n
\]

We set up the inequality to find when the total net profit equals or exceeds $90:
\[
7.5n \geq 90
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take \( n = 12 \) years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

students remaining. Next, 25% of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit at the end of the month, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5125
- Electronic Gadgets: $8096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Therefore, the profit from purchasing the electronic gadgets is $96."
"To determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to sum the distances traveled in each direction.

1. **First Day:**
   - Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

Since both trains follow the same route and travel the same distances each day, we can calculate the total distance for one train and then state the result for the other train.

**Total distance for one train:**
- Distance traveled westward: 80 miles
- Distance traveled northward: 150 miles

Adding these distances together:
\[
80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{230 \text{ miles}}

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's determine how many eggs Claire uses in one day. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs per day by 7:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks. We multiply the number of eggs per week by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to hike:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]
After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]
The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, let's determine the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we add the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink together. The total volume of the mixture is:
\[
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
\]
The total amount of water in the mixture is:
\[
6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years ago from Raymond's current age. Since Raymond is currently 25 years old, his son was born:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years ago} \]

Thus, the number of years ago Raymond's son was born is:
\[
\boxed{2}

- The next 2 customers each buy 2 DVDs, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so that's \(0\) DVDs.

Adding these together, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, the total reduction in the length of the candle is:

\[ 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm} \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price. This is because a 25% discount means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \). According to the problem, 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can express this relationship with the equation:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, we perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\].

So, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, we calculate the total cost for the shorts:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shorts} \times \$16.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 16.50 = \$49.50
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the pants:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$22.50 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 22.50 = \$67.50
\]

Then, we calculate the total cost for the shoes:
\[
3 \text{ pairs of shoes} \times \$42 \text{ per pair} = 3 \times 42 = \$126
\]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the items:
\[
\$49.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[
\boxed{243}

"First, we need to determine the total number of servings Cynthia will consume over 60 days. Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, over 60 days she will consume:

\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need. Each carton contains 15 servings. Therefore, the number of cartons required is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance remaining after the first stop: \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.
4. Determine the distance of the trip from the first stop to the end: 15 miles.
5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops by subtracting the distance from the second stop to the end from the remaining distance after the first stop: \(40 - 15 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice that amount, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem also states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the current ages of Darrell and Allen using the given ratio and total age.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]
Now that we have \(x = 9\), we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]
Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]
Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

The sum of the guesses is:
\[80 + 60 + 100 = 240\]

The average is:
\[\frac{240}{3} = 80\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

We are also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5
\]

Substituting the number of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:

\[
\text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2
\]

Substituting the number of Aaron's jewels:

\[
\text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. 

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means that the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left should equal the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by subtracting the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation checks out, we now need to determine how many lego sets John still has. The problem states that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he no longer has any lego sets left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run each day:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Other two days: half as much as the first day, so \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day

2. **Total distance run each day:**
   - First day: 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles
   - Other two days: 20 miles / 2 = 10 miles each day

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 20 miles
   - Other two days: 10 miles + 10 miles = 20 miles
   - Total: 20 miles + 20 miles = 40 miles

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Other two days: 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours
   - Total: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

5. **Average speed:**
   - Speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Speed = 40 miles / 6 hours = \(\frac{40}{6}\) miles per hour = \(\frac{20}{3}\) miles per hour ≈ 6.67 miles per hour

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.67}
\]"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

Let \( R \) be her running speed. Then:
\[
\frac{R}{2} = 3 \implies R = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, let \( W \) be her walking speed. We know that her running speed is four times her walking speed:
\[
R = 4W \implies 6 = 4W \implies W = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking in the six-hour period. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking:
\[
\text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:
\[
\text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]
\[
\text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Ben's iPhone as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone as follows:
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the throwing distance of the gold javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. 

The normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, the throwing distance is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it, but she needs to be at least 1000 feet away to be outside the dragon's reach.

To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily target after you have already consumed 1800 calories. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, so the remaining calories you can consume are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of the bag of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams you can eat per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we need:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost of 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles.
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  \]
  So, on Tuesday, she wrote \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 \) articles.
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at the coffee shop.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes remaining is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know that after using the notes, she had 23 Post-it notes left:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, we know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since the building has 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) per week from selling eggs."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back, we need to know the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided directly in the problem. We can denote the distance from his starting point to his destination as \(D\) miles.

First, we calculate the time Tom spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM. This is a 3-hour period, during which he travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Tom to travel back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time \(T\) required to travel back is given by the formula:
\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Thus, the time it takes Tom to get back is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.

- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires at $60 each:
  \[
  6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday.

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is:
  \[
  0 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[
  480 + 0 = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. The higher revenue day is Thursday, with $520, and the lower revenue day is Friday, with $480.

The difference in revenue is:
\[
520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."
"First, let's determine the number of adopted kittens the Doubtfire sisters brought home. They adopted 7 kittens.

Next, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy, the first cat, has had. According to the problem, Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Therefore, the number of kittens Patchy has had is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

The problem also states that Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens. 

Now, we can find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has by adding the adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

   \text{Weight of the driver and empty truck} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the weight of each box:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of each box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \left\lfloor \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \right\rfloor
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

7. **Since the result is an integer, the maximum number of boxes is:**
   \[
   \left\lfloor 83 \right\rfloor = 83
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is:
\[
\boxed{83}

"First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00. 

The 25% fee is calculated as:
\[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Adding this fee to the original bill:
\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:
\[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:
\[ 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:
\[ \boxed{57.00} \]"
"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to add the number of raspberries in the clusters to the number of individual raspberries.

First, calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, add the number of individual raspberries:
\[ 120 \text{ raspberries} + 67 \text{ individual raspberries} = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \]

Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges}) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 25 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Good oranges} = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and construction for the brooch. Janet pays $500 for the materials and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost of insuring the brooch. Janet pays 10% of the total cost of the materials and construction to get it insured. To find 10% of $1300, we multiply $1300 by 0.10:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the cost of the insurance to the total cost of the materials and construction to find the total amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is:

\[
\boxed{1430}
\]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the annual pension for the first 20 years.
2. Calculate the additional pension she becomes entitled to after 20 years.
3. Sum the two amounts to find her total annual pension after 30 years.

**Step 1: Annual Pension for the First 20 Years**

Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

**Step 2: Additional Pension After 20 Years**

Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. The value of the pension is $50,000, so the additional pension she receives each year is:
\[ 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

**Step 3: Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**

After 30 years, Marcy's total annual pension is the sum of her regular pension and the additional pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Thus, her annual pension after 30 years is:
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and calculate the cost for each half separately.

1. **Initial Monthly Charge:**
   The initial monthly charge is $140.

2. **First Half of the Year:**
   There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   \[
   \text{Total for first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840
   \]

3. **Second Half of the Year:**
   The charge for the second half of the year is 10% less than the initial monthly charge.
   \[
   \text{Reduced monthly charge} = 140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126
   \]
   There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.
   \[
   \text{Total for second half} = 6 \times 126 = 756
   \]

4. **Total Amount Paid for the Year:**
   Adding the totals from both halves of the year:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 840 + 756 = 1596
   \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is \( \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \).

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank:
- The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
- At 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is \( 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, Sophia can drive \(\boxed{300}\) miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of players and coaches per school by 4.
   - Total number of players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total number of coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

4. Adding the total number of players and coaches gives us the total number of people:
   - Total number of people: \(40 \text{ players} + 8 \text{ coaches} = 48 \text{ people}\).

Thus, the total number of people sent by all the schools is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:
\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:

\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she receives from her allowance over 8 weeks is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total amount is the sum of the money she started with and the money she received from her allowance. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the amount of money Bailey started with is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday through Friday) and 8 classes on Saturday. There are 5 weekdays, so the total number of classes from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Adding the 8 classes on Saturday, the total number of classes in a week is:

\[ 25 \text{ classes} + 8 \text{ classes} = 33 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students in a week is:

\[ 33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students} \]

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is:

\[20 + 40 = 60\]

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions in total."
"To determine how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- Tommy sells 43 brownie slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- Tommy sells 23 cheesecake slices.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the revenues from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \(\boxed{221}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones before interest is added.

The cost of one cell phone is $150. Therefore, the total cost for five cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total interest charged. The interest rate is 2% per unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
\[ 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the total cost and the total interest:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (Top level):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 3:** 
   \[
   \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ square feet}
   \]
3. **Level 2:** 
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ square feet}
   \]
4. **Level 1 (Bottom level):** 
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average square footage, we sum the square footage of all levels and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Total square footage} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \text{ square feet}
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the average square footage of a level is \(\boxed{7.5}\)."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags are needed for that amount.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Determine the number of bags needed for the first 180 days:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} \approx 1.636 \).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

**Final numerical answer:**
\[

"Let's denote the amount of laundry David does as \( D \) pounds. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does is \( 4D \) pounds. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 4D = 400 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry. Next, we need to determine how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is:

\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team played a total of 22 games, so we can write the equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

The problem also states that the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us another equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the number of games the team won is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The second time, the alarm rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Time the Alarm Rang:**
   - The third time, the alarm rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum up the total number of times the alarm rang:
\[ 4 \text{ (first time)} + 12 \text{ (second time)} + 6 \text{ (third time)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Annual Salary for the First 5 Years**: Since the salary does not change for the first 5 years, her annual salary remains:
   \[

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends. So, the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2. So, the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much potato salad each child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, and an adult eats 10 pounds, a child will eat:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults. With 20 adults, the total amount of potato salad for the adults is:

\[ 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children. With 5 children, the total amount of potato salad for the children is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts for the adults and the children gives the total amount of potato salad needed:

\[ 200 + 25 = 225 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic is:

\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pets Cindy has.
2. Use the information to find the number of pets Marcia has.
3. Use the information to find the number of pets Jan has.
4. Sum the number of pets each person has.

First, we know that Cindy has 4 pets:
\[ \text{Cindy's pets} = 4 \]

Next, we know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy:
\[ \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Then, we know that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia:
\[ \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the kids step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of the kids as follows:
   - Amy's age = \( A \)
   - Jackson's age = \( J \)
   - Corey's age = \( C \)
   - James's age = 10

2. According to the problem, James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   C = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   A = J + 5
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( A \) we found:
   \[
   9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

So, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. If Gerald's speed improved by 10%, his new time will be 90% of his original time. We can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( D \) be the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) be the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) be the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

Now, substitute the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. This is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes in the can.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes in one can**: Since each can of tomatoes results in 32 ounces of sauce, and the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes, the volume of tomatoes in one can is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the volume of tomatoes per tomato is:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{3 \text{ tomatoes}} = \frac{64}{3} \text{ ounces per tomato}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of cans used**: Since each can contains 64 ounces of tomatoes, and Freda made 32 ounces of sauce, she used:
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{32 \text{ ounces per can}} = 1 \text{ can}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used**: Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, and Freda used 1 can, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   1 \text{ can} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 3 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars from the line took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

This total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we subtract the number of potted plants she will give away from the total number of potted plants she currently has:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received yesterday to the remaining potted plants:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42:
\[
\text{Time to cover 42 miles} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is:
\[
\boxed{140}

\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
\]

After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750
\]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
\]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

"First, let's determine the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches for the walls, the inner dimensions are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length \(\times\) width \(\times\) height:
\[
3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches}
\]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
\[
24 \, \text{cubic inches} \times 3 = 72 \, \text{cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
  - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

- **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
  - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)

- **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
  - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

- **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
  - \(2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\)

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
- Total hours for Wednesday: \(7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours for Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}\)

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2x + 15 - 5 = 110
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:

3. **Calculate the combined total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:**
   - The combined total is:
     \[
     48 + 42 = 90
     \]

4. **Calculate the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten:**
   - The average is the total number of fruit roll-ups divided by the number of people (2):
     \[
     \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up the following proportion:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 64 \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16} = 64 \times 1.25 = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much water the boat took on during this 80 feet journey. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on per foot is:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of water taken on during the 80 feet journey:

\[
80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Let's denote the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we can express the relationship between the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold and Brittany's phone can hold:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):

   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for all boards: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

1. **Selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$10 + 0.5 \times \$10 = \$15 \).
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150 \).

2. **Selling price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Since prices have increased by 50%, the new price per board is \( \$16 + 0.5 \times \$16 = \$24 \).
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 7x + 13x = 120 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by 7x:
\[ 7x = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"

"First, we calculate the total number of vehicles that were initially at the port on the first day. Since there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day. Since each of these containers also contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles added on the second day is \( 5x \). Therefore, the equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is:
\[ 10 + 5x = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 5x = 30 - 10 \]
\[ 5x = 20 \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{5} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:

   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Adrien's new salary:
     \[
     40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
     \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%):
     \[
     30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92
     \]

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years later: $56,000
   - Lylah's salary four years later: $43,076.92
   - Total salary:
     \[
     56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
     \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets of paper in each pad, he uses \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets of paper per week. 

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so in a month, Miguel uses \(60 \times 4 = 240\) sheets of paper.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
240"
"First, let's determine the number of fruits each person brought.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the number of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total fruits: \(5 + 8 = 13\)
- Kael's total fruits: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Finally, let's find the total number of fruits they have together:
\[13 + 14 = 27\]

So, the total number of fruits they have is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's break down Sadie's sleep schedule for the week step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   For both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   She slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   For the four days (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday):
   \[
   7 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   Sum up the hours from each day.
   \[
   8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 28 \text{ (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)} = 48 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the distance she runs in the first 3 hours and the distance she runs in the remaining 4 hours.

1. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the first 3 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance Rosie runs in the remaining 4 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters she stamped, we calculate one-third of 60:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, Jennie put stamps on 20 letters. These 20 letters are now part of the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after adding these 20 letters, the pile of already-stamped letters contains 30 letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie added the 20 letters is:

\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).

Initially, Julia had 0 spoons. After buying a package of \( x \) spoons, she had \( x \) spoons. Her husband then gave her a package of 5 spoons, so the total number of spoons she had became \( x + 5 \).

Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so the number of spoons left is \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \). According to the problem, after using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, which means he bought \(38 + 6 = 44\) fish sausages. 

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together: \(38 + 44 = 82\).

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To determine the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together, we start by identifying the number of friends each of them has.

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. We can express this as:
\[ \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 50 \]

Next, we are told that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, the number of friends Amy has is:
\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

To find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = 50 + 70 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information.

1. The cost of each pepper is given as $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Therefore, the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:
- The cost for 4 watermelons is:
  \[
  4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The cost for 20 peppers is:
  \[
  20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The cost for 10 oranges is:
  \[
  10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we add up the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:
\[
180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[
\boxed{880}
\]"
"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate both the revenue and the cost for the hospital and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total number of patients seen in a day:**
   \[
   \text{Number of patients} = 500
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent with patients in a day:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Convert minutes to hours:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 200 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the hospital's revenue from the patients:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the hospital's cost for the doctors:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the hospital's profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 40000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

The hospital's profit from these visits is:
\[
\boxed{10000}

"To determine how many elves are left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. Calculate how many elves quit after children vomit on them. A third of the elves quit, so we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   Therefore, 20 elves quit, and the number of elves remaining is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. After that, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Joseph's expenditure in June.
2. Add the expenditures of May and June together.

First, we know that Joseph's expenditure in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less than in May. Therefore, we can calculate his June expenditure as follows:
\[ 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Now, we add the expenditures of May and June to find the total expenditure for the two months:
\[ 500 + 440 = 940 \]

So, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months is \(\boxed{940}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of rides each person took.

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, so she took a total of:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ rides} \]

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, so he took a total of:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rides for both Pam and Fred combined:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ rides} \]

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday. According to the problem, he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, we calculate the miles walked on Tuesday as follows:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. We can express this total as the sum of the miles walked on each day:

\[ \text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday} + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Substituting the known values for Monday and Tuesday, we get:

\[ 4 + 24 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

To find the miles walked on Wednesday, we simplify the equation:

\[ 28 + \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the miles walked on Wednesday:

\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

Thus, the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
2. Multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year.

First, we know that Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each car wash costs $15. So, the monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times \$15/\text{car wash} = \$60/\text{month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ \$60/\text{month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$720/\text{year} \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays in a year for car washes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"First, let's determine how many video games Brian has right before the comparison is made. Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so he has:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ video games} \]

Next, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5:

\[ 3 \times 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has \(\boxed{40}\) video games."
"First, we need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Scottish unicorns are female. We know that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the items before any additional fees or tips:

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to add a 20% delivery fee to this total. The delivery fee is calculated as:
\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Adding the delivery fee to the total cost of the items gives:
\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip. Adding the tip to the total with the delivery fee gives:
\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the first test:
- The test consisted of 75 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he answered in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he answered in the second test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is the sum of the questions left incomplete in both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is 12. Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \( 70 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars: 20
2. Number of automatic cars: 12
3. Number of manual cars: 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much money Jordan would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games. Since he earns $10 per hour at his part-time job, we can calculate his earnings as follows:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items including tax to get the total cost:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:

\[3 + 5 = 8\]

Next, we need to calculate the total expenses for the bleach and cloths. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of bleach is $2 per bottle and the cost of cloths is $5 per pack. Therefore, the cost per client is:

\[2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2/\text{bottle} + 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5/\text{pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9\]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses will be:

\[8 \text{ clients} \times \$9/\text{client} = \$72\]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[\$92 - \$72 = \$20\]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[\boxed{20}\]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many harvests he can make in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Johnny has a lego set with 500 pieces.
2. He has another lego set with 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set. So, the number of pieces in this set is:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
3. He also has another lego set with 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece set. So, the number of pieces in this set is:
   \[
   \frac{500}{4} = 125
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up by summing the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125
\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[
500 + 1500 = 2000

"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, we convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve is the winner, we need to find out how long he will be waiting for Tim:
- Difference in time: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for the loser (Tim) for \(\boxed{4}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For the bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the unicycle: A unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

Now, we determine how much change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate their 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate its 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate his 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}\)
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\)

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}\)
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

Now, let's find the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of hours for the entire semester, which has 16 weeks:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches and then convert the total length to feet.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Convert the length of each baguette to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches): \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, convert the total length from inches to feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[ \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly requirement: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) bananas

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly requirement: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) bananas

Next, we sum the total number of bananas required for all the apes over 2 months:
\[ 400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Therefore, the distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is a distance of 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back), and she does this 34 times. Therefore, the distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 2 \times 40 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. The difference in the distance they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is:
     \[
     17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the depth of the water on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{48}{3} \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}

The depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is \(\boxed{16}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Calculate the price after each 2-month period:**
   - The price after each 2-month period is the original price plus 20% of the original price.
   - This can be expressed as multiplying the current price by \( 1 + 0.20 = 1.20 \).

3. **Determine the number of 2-month periods in 36 months:**
   - \( \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \)

4. **Calculate the price after 18 periods:**
   - The price after 18 periods can be calculated using the formula for compound interest: \( P = P_0 \times (1.20)^{18} \).

5. **Perform the calculation:**
   - \( P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)
   - First, calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
     \[
     (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]
   - Then, multiply by the original price:
     \[
     P = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
     \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{787.32}\) dollars."

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost of accessories:
\[ 157 + 74 + 102 = 333 \]

Now, we add the cost of the computer to the total cost of the accessories:
\[ 1090 + 333 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need to make 15 Spanish flans. Since each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs required is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs. Since her neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   B + S + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:
   \[
   B + S = 24
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( B + S = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. Replace \( S \) with \( 2B \) in the second equation:
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3B = 24
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

So, Jimmy has $18. 

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
18"
"To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to break down his walking schedule.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Pancho walks 20 miles each day.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekdays: \( 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Pancho walks 10 miles each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total miles walked on weekends: \( 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Total miles walked in a week:**
   - Sum of miles walked on weekdays and weekends: \( 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of each item in the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat. Therefore, the cost of the jacket is:
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these ages together:

\[19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\]

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18000}

"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be their total cost.
   - Profit is calculated as: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C
     \]
   - Rearrange to find the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
   - The cost per gallon is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is:
     \[
     3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars per gallon}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( G \) gallons is:
     \[
     C = 5G
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue in terms of \( G \):**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50.
   - The total number of glasses sold is:
     \[
     20G
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the glasses is:
     \[
     0.50 \times 20G = 10G \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for total revenue:**
   - From step 1, we have:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = C + 25
     \]
   - Substitute the expressions for total revenue and total cost:
     \[
     10G = 5G + 25
     \]

5. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Subtract \( 5G \) from both sides:
     \[
     10G - 5G = 25
     \]
     \[
     5G = 25
     \]
   - Divide by 5:
     \[
     G = 5
     \]

6. **Calculate the total cost on lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - For 5 gallons, the total cost on lemons is:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, the amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, we need to determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know the total number of Asians is 240, and out of these, 80 are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is calculated as follows:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 Chinese participants. We are given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60. To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount given to wife} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Total amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the number of crabs each person has based on the information given.

1. **Bo's Crabs:**
   Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Monic's Crabs:**
   Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Rani's Crabs:**
   Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

Next, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:

\[
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
\]
\[
\text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
40 + 36 = 76
\]
\[
76 + 46 = 122
\]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:

\[
\boxed{122}
\]"

   R = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Let's denote the current ages of Jean and Mark as \( J \) and \( M \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Since Jan is currently 30 years old, two years ago Jan was 28 years old. Therefore, two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and half of Jan's age was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age is 21, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:
\[ J = M + 2 \]
\[ J = 21 + 2 \]
\[ J = 23 \]

So, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

Each member of the well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The less well-rounded team's times are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The difference in time is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:

\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, it is \(\boxed{25}\) percent more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits, and then use that information to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the rats.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\).

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total number of pieces of straw distributed among all the small rodents is 160.
   - Subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total to find the pieces of straw given to the rats.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\).

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats in each cage. Then the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \(3 \times r \times 6 = 18r\).
   - We know that \(18r = 90\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we get \(r = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount including the monthly interest. The initial amount Mandy owes is $100, and the monthly interest rate is 2%.

First, let's calculate the amount after the first month:
\[ \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102 \]

Next, we calculate the amount after the second month:
\[ \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 \times (1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04 \]

Finally, we calculate the amount after the third month:
\[ \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 \times (1 + 0.02) = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:

"Let's denote the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

1. **Cost of buying the bags:**
   - The cost per bag is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) bags is \( 20x \).

2. **Cost of transporting the bags:**
   - The transportation cost per bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \).

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for buying and transporting the bags is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \).

4. **Revenue from selling the bags:**
   - The selling price per bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     30x - 22x = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     8x = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
     \]

The trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, the amount each of them paid is:

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly amount into a daily amount.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for a flock of ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out on the front yard.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[
\frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B}
\]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[
500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
\]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[
500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. Since there are 6 pens in each bag of red pens and she bought 2 bags, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Now, let's find the total number of pens Janet has by adding the green pens, yellow pens, blue pens, and red pens together. Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, so the total number of pens she has now is:
\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of tests and the desired average:**
   - Mr. Bert gives 6 tests each semester.
   - Brinley wants an average of 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   \[
   \text{Total score needed} = 93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The total score after including the sixth test will be \( 438 + x \).
   - Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to consider the possible lowest scores and their impact on the average.

5. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - The lowest score is 71.

6. **Calculate the adjusted total score after removing the lowest score:**
   - If 71 is removed, the adjusted total score is \( 438 - 71 = 367 \).

7. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   367 + x = 465
   \]
   \[
   x = 465 - 367
   \]
   \[
   x = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{98}\) on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 125 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for four weeks:
\[
125 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

First, calculate the total kilometers for one week:
\[
2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ kilometers/ride} = 120 \text{ kilometers/week}
\]

Next, calculate the total kilometers for three weeks:
\[
120 \text{ kilometers/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ kilometers}
\]

**Total Kilometers:**
Add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
\[
500 \text{ kilometers} + 360 \text{ kilometers} = 860 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal did is:
\[
\boxed{860}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g}
\]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
\]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

\[
\boxed{2600}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60
   \]
4. To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes bought each day:
   \[
   4 + 12 + 60 = 76
   \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) will cost:
\[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \text{ dollars} \]

Since twenty dozen cups is equal to \(24 \times 20 = 480\) cups, the cost of each cup is:
\[ \frac{34800}{480} = 72.5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[ \boxed{72.5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much more money Sara needs after accounting for her savings and earnings from babysitting:
- Sara already has $10 saved.
- After babysitting, she has an additional $20.
- Therefore, her total savings and earnings from babysitting are \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.
- The amount of money she still needs is \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40:
- Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn.
- To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the remaining amount by her earnings per time: \(40 \div 4 = 10\).

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn \(\boxed{10}\) times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day each, and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day each. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, the number of white chickens is two more than the number of red chickens, so we can write the following equations:

\[ 5w + 3r = 42 \]
\[ w = r + 2 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( w \):

\[ 5(r + 2) + 3r = 42 \]

Now, distribute and combine like terms:

\[ 5r + 10 + 3r = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Next, isolate \( r \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Then, solve for \( r \) by dividing both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \(\boxed{4}\) red chickens."
"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(v\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Calculate the number of customers counted on the second day.
3. Use the total number of customers over the three days to find the number of customers on the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

Next, on the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Let the number of customers on the third day be \( x \). According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 + 150 + x = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 250 + x = 500 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 250 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 500 - 250 \]
\[ x = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago as \( B_0 \) and the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S_0 \). According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

\[ B_0 = 2S_0 \]

Now, let's denote the amount of water in the big pool now as \( B \) and the amount of water in the small pool now as \( S \). Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water lost from each pool in the last 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons. Therefore, the current amount of water in the big pool is:

\[ B = B_0 - 16 \]

And the current amount of water in the small pool is:

\[ S = S_0 - 16 \]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can write:

\[ B = 4S \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B_0 \) and \( S_0 \), we get:

\[ B_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

We already know from the first equation that \( B_0 = 2S_0 \). Substituting \( B_0 = 2S_0 \) into the equation above, we get:

\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4(S_0 - 16) \]

Expanding and simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S_0 - 16 = 4S_0 - 64 \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( S_0 \), we get:

\[ 64 - 16 = 4S_0 - 2S_0 \]
\[ 48 = 2S_0 \]
\[ S_0 = 24 \]

So, 4 minutes ago, the small pool had 24 gallons of water. Since the small pool has been losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute for the last 4 minutes, the current amount of water in the small pool is:

\[ S = S_0 - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to determine the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
  \]

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in three years} + \text{Zack's age in three years} + \text{Adrian's age in three years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"First, let's determine the points scored by each student based on the information given.

1. **Naomi's Points:**
   Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Yuri's Points:**
   Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. 
   \[
   \text{Half of Naomi's points} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Brianna's Points:**
   Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all four students is 251.

5. **Jojo's Points:**
   To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one Sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 Sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on Sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. Therefore, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater, which is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated as follows:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, Andy plants 50 petunias. Next, we need to find the total number of flowers he plants by adding the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year. The total amount spent on advertising over the two years is:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is:
  \[
  30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is:
  \[
  18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji:
\[
90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
\[
\boxed{180}

"First, we need to determine the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the travel time by car is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the travel time by bus and the travel time by car:

\[ 6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{32 \times 100}{96} = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. **Base burrito cost**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces (each $0.25)**: $0.25 × 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the additional costs:
\[ 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 7.50 \]

Next, we add the base burrito cost to the total of the additional costs:
\[ 6.50 + 7.50 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, which he uses at checkout. So, we subtract this from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.
2. Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
4. Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after two months.**

The farm produced 120 baby watermelons, and 30% of them were ready for harvest.
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

**Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.**

Subtract the number of ready watermelons from the total number of watermelons.
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]
So, 84 watermelons remained after Ashlyn took the ready ones home.

**Step 3: Calculate how many of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.**

After two weeks, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest.
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

**Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.**

Subtract the number of ready watermelons from the remaining watermelons.
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]
So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[
12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%.

\[
240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Now, we add the tax to the total cost of the cars.

\[
240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a registration fee of $1000, and there are 12 cars.

\[
12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, we add the registration fees to the total cost including tax.

\[
264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[
\boxed{276000}

"First, let's determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. According to the problem, Robert collected 20 shells on Monday, and Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert. Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday is:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Given that Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden, and there were 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of ants
Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Initially, there are 36 penguins sunbathing. 

One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins swim in the ocean.

Another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that have left from the initial number:
\[
36 - 12 - 12 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes they both eat per day:

\[
6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of tomatoes they eat per week is:

\[
9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week}
\]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total number of tomatoes by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[
\frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines}
\]

Thus, the number of vines Steve needs is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

First, we calculate the total number of slices needed. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{80}{8} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to follow the process step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle of Refilling**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.
3. **Second Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 5 pens he made from the first cycle, giving him a total of 10 pens. From these 10 pens, he can make \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) new pens.
4. **Third Cycle of Refilling**: Now, he has 2 new pens plus the 2 pens he made from the second cycle, giving him a total of 4 pens. From these 4 pens, he can make \( \frac{4}{5} = 0 \) new pens (since 4 is less than 5).

So, the total number of pens he can have is the sum of the pens he initially bought and the pens he made in each cycle:
\[ 25 + 5 + 2 = 32 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. The time it takes for Mike to write one page is 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing in a week is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{3}\]"
"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes are left:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   \[
   24 \text{ fries}
   \]

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   \[
   5 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Kyle took 5 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Billy took 10 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( f \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2f \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2f \]
\[ 28 = 4f \]

To find \( f \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ f = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours for the entire 5 weeks:

\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jean gets a 10% discount after the movie is done, we need to calculate 10% of the total cost and subtract it from the total cost:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 30000 \text{ dollars} = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} - 3000 \text{ dollars} = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:

\[ \boxed{27000} \]"

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies eaten by Sue:**
\[ 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

**Total cookies eaten by her sister:**
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed by Sue:**
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

**Calories consumed by her sister:**
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:
\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."

"First, let's determine how many times Anne went down the water slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

This means Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, we calculate:

"First, let's determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall redwood tree. 

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it. Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood. Therefore, 70% of the redwood remains. We calculate 70% of the original weight:

\[
0.70 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:

"Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as \( J_a \) and the number of bananas Jamal has as \( J_b \).

Given:
1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples, we substitute \( A_a \) with 52:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
Solving for \( J_a \):
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 = 44 \]
So, Jamal has 44 apples.

From the third piece of information, we know:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
Substituting \( J_a \) with 44:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 = 48 \]
So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

From the second piece of information, we know:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
Since \( J_b = 48 \):
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]
So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

The total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

The final numerical answer is:

2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"First, we need to determine how many pennies are in two-thirds of the cup. The cup contains 9,300 pennies. To find two-thirds of 9,300, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, there are 6,200 pennies in two-thirds of the cup. Since 100 pennies make up $1.00, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

\[
\frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is \(\boxed{62}\)."

\[ 250 \text{ marbles} + 20 \text{ marbles} = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

So, Maddison now has 270 marbles."
"First, let's determine the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, and Chris has 6 trees, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we need to find out how many trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand. We subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Thus, the number of trees Harry has more than Ferdinand is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money each girl has.

1. Carmen has $100.
2. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]
3. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

Next, we add up the amounts of money each girl has to find the total:
\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Carmen's money} + \text{Samantha's money} + \text{Daisy's money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[
100 + 125 = 225
\]
\[
225 + 175 = 400
\]

So, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500
   \]

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = \$9,500
   \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for the selling price, the transfer fees, the brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Total fees} - \text{Remaining loan amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 - \$250,000 = \$118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.4 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees, the time to heat to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so the number of golf balls is:

\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:

\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:

\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to account for the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

To find the total number of windows in both houses, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms to the number of additional windows:

\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

First, add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]

Next, add the cost of the pasta:

\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for the collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the body and the collar and rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the sleeves:**
   The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the number of stitches for the sleeves is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30

\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both types of seeds:
\[
\text{Total cost for all seeds} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\)."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Summing up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
   - Solo song: 54 lines
   - First scene: 36 lines
   - Second scene: 48 lines

"First, let's determine how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter B. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

So, 24 cards had the letter B. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining cards had the letter C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

So, 15 cards had the letter C. This means the remaining number of cards is:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages plus 10 years each. Since their current sum of ages is 20, in 10 years, the sum will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we have \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently \(\boxed{6}\) years old."

So, the total amount Peter paid is \(\$7.00\)."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[
\text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
\]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
\]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[
\text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
\]

Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[
\text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]"

   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length.
   \[
   \text{Remaining length for sterling silver beads} = 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.

"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate the number of medals Izzy has as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out for counting as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x = 10 \times 39 \]

So, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points:**
   - Mike has 21 points.

2. **Jim's points:**
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - \( 21 - 3 = 18 \) points.

3. **Tony's points:**
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike.
   - \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \) points.

Next, we need to add the extra point to each player if they have over 20 points in the fourth round.

4. **Mike's points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20.
   - \( 21 + 1 = 22 \) points.

5. **Jim's points after the fourth round:**
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20.
   - \( 18 + 0 = 18 \) points.

6. **Tony's points after the fourth round:**
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20.
   - \( 42 + 1 = 43 \) points.

Finally, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 + 18 + 43 = 83
\]

The total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day.

- **Pushups on the second day**: 
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120
  \]

- **Squats on the second day**: 
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40
  \]

- **Dumbbell presses on the second day**: 
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40
  \]

Next, we sum up the activities for each day.

**First day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for the first day:
\[
100 + 50 + 20 = 170
\]

**Second day:**
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Total for the second day:
\[
120 + 40 + 40 = 200
\]

Finally, we add the totals from both days to find the overall total:
\[
170 + 200 = 370
\]

Thus, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}
\]"
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - The number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

So, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and there are 3 other bidders who each bid once before Carmen wins.

1. The first bid by Carmen is $200 (the opening bid).
2. The second bid by Carmen is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid by Carmen is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid by Carmen is $300 + $50 = $350.

So, Carmen's bids are $200, $250, $300, and $350. The total amount she spends is the sum of these bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 = 1100 \]

Thus, the desk costs Carmen \(\boxed{1100}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total distance John travels in a day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles each day.

Next, we calculate the total distance he travels in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, the total distance in a week is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

Now, we calculate the total distance he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, the total distance in a year is \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles.

John is charged $2 per mile driven, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. Since he gives a $150 bonus per month and there are 50 weeks in a year, he works 10 months in a year (assuming he doesn't work in the 2 weeks of the 11th month). Therefore, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 10 = 1500\) dollars.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays a year for driving. The total cost is \(30000 + 1500 = 31500\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31500}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. According to the problem, Peter exercised for 16 minutes on Monday and 23 minutes on Sunday. Therefore, the total time exercised on these two days is:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday. The problem states that he wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper is folded in half, creating two pages on the front and two pages on the back. Therefore, each piece of paper contributes 4 pages to the tabloid.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper used by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper contributes:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after the rides is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of books**: 250
2. **Books sold this year**: 45
3. **Books sold in the first year**: \(2 \times 45 = 90\)
4. **Books sold in the second year**: Let's denote this as \(x\)
5. **Books remaining unsold**: 50

First, we need to find out how many books have been sold in total over the three years. Since there are 50 unsold books, the number of books sold is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, we know the number of books sold in the first and third years, so we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ 90 + x + 45 = 200 \]
\[ 135 + x = 200 \]
\[ x = 200 - 135 \]
\[ x = 65 \]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is 65. Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings. Since he works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April has 30 days, and since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks in April is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 4.2857 \text{ weeks} \]

Since we are calculating the total earnings for the whole month, we can consider the full 4 weeks and the remaining 2 days. For the full 4 weeks, his earnings are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

For the remaining 2 days, his earnings are:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 2 \text{ days} = \$200 \]

Adding these together, his total earnings for April are:
\[ \$3200 + \$200 = \$3400 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3400} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.

\[
\text{Loaves left after morning sales} = 60 - 40 = 20
\]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is half of the remaining 20 loaves.

\[
\text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks) is:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, the total amount saved is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra arm is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra leg is:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} = 8
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow \(\boxed{8}\) new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we calculate the total amount spent on the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is the total amount he can spend minus the amount spent on the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so the total for these three people is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so the total for these two people is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family each day is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, to find the total number of eggs consumed in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

\[13 \times 7 = 91\]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
2. Cera's current age is 46 years.
3. Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \) and Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera:
\[ N - 6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \]
\[ N - 6 = 20 \]
\[ N = 26 \]

So, Noah's current age is 26 years.

Next, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population of Chile six years ago was:
\[ 3000 \times 20 = 60000 \]

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is:
\[ 60000 \times 2 = 120000 \]

So, the population of Chile now is:
\[ \boxed{120000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited to her party.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people couldn't come due to illness and how many had previous commitments. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come to the party is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

To find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:
\[ 24 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
   \[
   78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

The total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required.

First, let's denote the number of electric poles as \( P \) and the number of electric wires as \( W \). According to the ratio, we have:
\[ P : W = 1 : 3 \]

This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. Therefore, the number of electric poles \( P \) can be expressed in terms of the number of electric wires \( W \) as:
\[ P = \frac{W}{3} \]

Given that the number of electric wires \( W \) is 45, we substitute \( W \) with 45 in the equation:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party. There were 25 men and 15 women, so the total number of people is:
\[ 25 + 15 = 40 \]

After an hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore, the number of people who left is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
This means that the number of people who stayed at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( w \). The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the men and women who stayed:
\[ 22 + w = 30 \]
Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who are left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs:

\[
2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since Jam has three boxes and the total number of pencils in these boxes is 24, each box must contain:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, let's determine the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{9}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weakening from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}

   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening:**
   Add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream.
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the total number of new records they received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times \text{Number of new records} \]
\[ \text{Number of old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Next, we need to find the number of senior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100 and there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

We know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial number of lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]
   So, he has 22 lollipops left.

3. **Lollipops given to friends:**
   Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]
   So, he has 8 lollipops left.

4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the lollipops he has left:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]
   So, he has 36 lollipops now.

5. **Lollipops eaten later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33
   \]
   So, he has 33 lollipops left.

6. **Lollipops eaten in the morning:**
   Oscar eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31
   \]
   So, he has 31 lollipops left.

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone is currently at 60% and needs to reach 100%, so the remaining charge needed is:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to charge one percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take \(\boxed{2}\) hours to fully charge the cell phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:
\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

So, the final number of lollipops Erin has left is:
\[ 14 \]"
"First, let's determine the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[
\text{Amount taken off by the coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total discount applied to the current purchase:

\[
\text{Total discount} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on this shopping trip:

\[
\text{Amount paid} = 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: \( 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \) dollars
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: \( 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: \( 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000 \) dollars
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: \( 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600 \) dollars
- Net pay: \( 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400 \) dollars

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs to determine which job pays more and by how much.

**Net pay comparison:**
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
\[ 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400 \]

Therefore, Nick will make \(\boxed{8400}\) dollars more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles in Scotland are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to determine how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, so we calculate:

\[ 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \]

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (not RJ, as RJ is not mentioned in the list of people) has 5 guns, and Jason has 1 gun. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 1 = 24 \]

Next, we need to divide the total number of guns equally among the four people. So, we divide 24 by 4:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

Therefore, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have \(\boxed{6}\) guns."
"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers. Since each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar, the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches is:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge. Since each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar, the total amount of sugar needed for 1 batch is:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of sugar needed:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"First, let's calculate the value of Maria's shares after the first year. Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[ \text{Initial value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. So, the new price per share is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$8 + (0.50 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 8 shares after the price increase:

\[ \text{Value after first year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share is:

\[ \text{New price per share} = \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 8 shares after the price decrease:

\[ \text{Value after second year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

1. Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
2. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, Thomas ate:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]
3. John ate half the amount Thomas ate. Therefore, John ate:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so the difference is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students in the class is 200, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of students:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine the total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]
   The total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   C + H = 60
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve for \( C \):**
   Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
   Simplify and solve for \( C \):
   \[
   3C = 60

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to find the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from selling tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from selling silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the difference in daily revenue between selling silos and tractors:

\[ \text{Difference in revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase in revenue, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference in revenue}}{\text{Original revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Treats cost $20 per month.**

3. **Medicine costs $100 per month.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Monthly cost of food + Monthly cost of treats + Monthly cost of medicine

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her initial savings to the earnings from both jobs to find out how much money she has in total:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the phone is $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of each tree step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.
2. The height of the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. First, we find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
   \[
   2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the items:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After buying the toys, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how much money is left for the friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf:**
   - Morgan and her friends will play one round of mini-golf each.
   - The cost of one round of mini-golf is $5.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite. Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for mini-golf is \( 5 \times (n + 1) \).

2. **Cost of arcade tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.
   - This cost is fixed at $5.

3. **Cost of go-karts:**
   - The cost of one ride on the go-karts is $10.
   - Morgan and her friends will ride the go-karts twice each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for go-karts is \( 10 \times 2 \times (n + 1) = 20 \times (n + 1) \).

4. **Total budget:**
   - Morgan's budget is $90.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total cost and solve for \( n \):

\[
5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1) = 90
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5(n + 1) + 20(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

\[
25(n + 1) + 5 = 90
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
25(n + 1) = 85
\]

Divide both sides by 25:

\[
n + 1 = \frac{85}{25}
\]

\[
n + 1 = 3.4
\]

Subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
n = 2.4
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't invite a fraction of a friend), we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, Morgan can invite \(\boxed{2}\) friends."
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. Since she saves $4 each day, the total amount saved over 5 days is:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Total cost of gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the change Billy had after buying the gumballs:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He spent $2 on gumballs.
   - Change after buying gumballs = \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Determine how much money Billy spent on candy:**
   - Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs.
   - Half of his change = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Thus, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. The combined distance of the first two legs is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the daily travel distance of 900 miles:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days. The final answer is:
\[\boxed{20}\]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara currently has 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin scored 14 points to reach her current total of 24 points, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   - Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the number of shoes sold on Friday is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Saturday is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes, the number of shoes sold on Saturday is:

     28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ shoes}
     \]

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On Sunday, the store sold one-half the number of pairs sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Converting pairs to shoes, the number of shoes sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ shoes}
     \]
   - However, six pairs were returned, which means 12 shoes were returned (since each pair consists of 2 shoes):
     \[
     12 \text{ shoes returned}
     \]
   - Therefore, the net number of shoes sold on Sunday is:
     \[
     28 - 12 = 16 \text{ shoes}

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.0835 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the interest is $152.08. Therefore, the total amount Karan has to pay back is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.08 \]

Now, we need to find out how much she has to pay per month by dividing the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is $760.42.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked. Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. The distance \( D \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \]

For Cho:

\[ D_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked. Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ D_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Difference} = D_{\text{Cho}} - D_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. According to the problem, Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel.

So, Anna has:
- \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos
- \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is:
\[50 + 100 = 150\]

The total number of gold pesos they have together is:
\[80 + 120 = 200\]

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:

So, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. Therefore, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes her to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Thus, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can break it down:

\[
12.8 \times 2.5 = 12.8 \times \left(2 + 0.5\right) = 12.8 \times 2 + 12.8 \times 0.5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
12.8 \times 2 = 25.6
\]
\[
12.8 \times 0.5 = 6.4
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
25.6 + 6.4 = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
x = 32
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since the choir has 52 members and 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who can perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these step-by-step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400. Next, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- The total cost is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) messages.

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives him 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is:
\[ 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4 \text{ per ride} \]

Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
\[ 9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36 \]

Now, let's compare the total costs:
- David's total cost: $30 (for the ride bracelet)
- Dasha's total cost: $36

The amount David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of individual tickets is:
\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, we need to determine the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica is wrapping a total of 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \]

Therefore, Monica can use \(\boxed{12}\) inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles they have together is given as 165. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Thus, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount.

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost for these three services before the discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and subscribing to the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording the song: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total time spent on all activities:
\[
4 \text{ hours (writing)} + 2 \text{ hours (recording)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (editing)} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[

\]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of slots available in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. So, we calculate double the number of slots and then add 20:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry \(\boxed{92}\) books to complete her task."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Valentine's cards Erica initially had:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, Erica initially had:
\[20 + 30 = 50\]

Next, let's account for the cards she passed out and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

The total number of cards Erica passed out is:
\[24 + 5 = 29\]

The net change in the number of cards Erica has is the number of cards she received minus the number of cards she passed out:
\[17 - 29 = -12\]

So, the total number of cards Erica now has is:
\[50 - 29 - 12 = 9\]

Therefore, the final number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
\]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
\]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we subtract the slices Jenny eats from the total number of slices:
\[
12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 90 spiders and the number of millipedes is \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many as the spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:
\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

Now, we sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs:

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours a day, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the air conditioner will be used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the original and reduced usage:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of stripes on each zebra:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, the total number of stripes for these two zebras is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

2. The next zebra has 36 stripes.

3. The last zebra has half as many stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes. So, the number of stripes on this zebra is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes on all the zebras:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88
\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

Thus, the average number of stripes per zebra is:

"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Therefore, the number of sandwiches required to serve 20 people is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat}
   \]
   \[
   5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 5 pounds of meat is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

"First, let's determine the initial number of corns in Allan's house. According to the problem, there are twice as many corns as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially.

\[ \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. Therefore, the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ \text{New total number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of corns bought} = 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Adding these 20 corns to the initial 80 corns, the new total number of corns is:

\[ \text{New total number of corns} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

\[ \text{Combined total} = 100 \text{ (corns)} + 100 \text{ (cannolis)} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school.
   - He took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

2. **Determine the number of steps taken before the jog:**
   - Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, he must have taken \(10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000\) steps before his jog.

3. **Calculate the steps taken during the jog:**
   - He took 5,000 steps to school and 5,000 steps back from school, totaling \(5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000\) steps.
   - He also took 1,000 steps for the short walk with his friend.
   - Therefore, the total steps taken before the jog is \(10,000 + 1,000 = 11,000\) steps, but we know he only took 8,000 steps before the jog.

4. **Find the discrepancy:**
   - The discrepancy is \(11,000 - 8,000 = 3,000\) steps, which means he must have taken 3,000 steps during his jog to account for the 2,000 steps left.

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words per page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, he needs to leave 10 minutes before the 60-minute mark:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will leave at:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{40}\) minutes early."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for every 1.5 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (which is half off $3).

Since Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, we can break it down as follows:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound costs $1.50 (which is half of $3).

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so the total cost for 4 magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packs. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the two packs to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150, to the discounted price:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies. We do this by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of candles that are more dangerous:**
   - Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are more dangerous.
   - Number of more dangerous candles = \( 50000 \times 0.01 = 500 \).

2. **Calculate the number of more dangerous candles that also have a defect:**
   - 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are more dangerous = \( 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \).

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"First, we need to determine the discount price of each blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20:

\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount on each blouse is $6. To find the discounted price of each blouse, we subtract the discount from the original price:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses at the discounted price of $14 each. To find the total cost, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To eliminate \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides, we get:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances traveled:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships between the sizes of the lockers step by step.

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
   - Peter's locker is given as 5 cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cubic inches.

2. **Determine the size of Timothy's locker:**
   - We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
   - Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Timothy's locker is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cubic inches.

The size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation of the comb after it fell from Stanley's pocket. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb's elevation is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the comb. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver and the comb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from the comb's elevation:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"First, we need to determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. According to the problem, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks to the initial capital Mr. Josue had. He initially had $5000. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[
\boxed{17000}

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]
So, the number of cats left after the boats took some away is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]
So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

The final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284

"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars from the jogger jeans} \]
and
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars from the tattered jeans} \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the sale price, so \( J = 22 + 6 = 28 \).

However, the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the original price of the jogger jeans is $28 and the original price of the tattered jeans is also $28, the difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans is $6 more than the original price of the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder. According to the problem, each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds, and each bird feeder Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one. Therefore, each of Lillian's bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 bird feeders she built and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder.

For the bird feeders Lillian built:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

For the store-bought bird feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:
\[ 90 \text{ birds} + 60 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"

So, the cost of the soup is:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the cake. The cake costs half the price of the bagel:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

1. **Determine the number of cards sold:**
   Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards.
   \[
   \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{2}{3}x
   \]

2. **Calculate the total money from selling the cards:**
   Each card is sold for $1.5, so the total money from selling the cards is:
   \[
   \text{Total money from selling cards} = 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x
   \]

3. **Determine the total money Kenny has after buying the ticket:**
   Kenny uses the money from selling the cards to buy a $100 ticket and still has $50 left for spending cash. Therefore, the total money he has after buying the ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Total money after buying ticket} = 100 + 50 = 150
   \]

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \( x \):**
   Since the total money from selling the cards is equal to $150, we have:
   \[
   x = 150
   \]

Thus, the number of cards Kenny started with is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests each get 2 hotdogs, so the total number of hotdogs for these guests is \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining half of the guests (18 guests) each get 1 hotdog, so the total number of hotdogs for these guests is \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Determine the number of hotdogs needed for 40 guests to each have a second hotdog:**
   - If each of the 40 guests wants a second hotdog, they would need an additional 40 hotdogs.
   - Since each guest already has one hotdog, they need 40 more hotdogs in total.

3. **Calculate the number of hotdogs available for the second hotdog:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs initially.
   - After serving the first hotdog to all 40 guests, 40 hotdogs are used.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs left is \( 54 - 40 = 14 \) hotdogs.

4. **Determine how many guests can get a second hotdog:**
   - With 14 hotdogs left, 14 guests can get a second hotdog.

5. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - There are 40 guests in total.
   - 14 guests get a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \( 40 - 14 = 26 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name. Indras has 6 letters in her name.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

To find half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Now, we add 4 to this number to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

To find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[
\boxed{13}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so for 5 utensils, the cost is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:
Required amount = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Required amount = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so the total cost for 3 bags is:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. This means he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends equally.

"Rory's cake initially weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. When Rory and her mom each have a piece, they together have taken 2 pieces. 

Since the cake was divided equally into 8 pieces, each piece weighs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

Together, Rory and her mom have:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00/\text{servings} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes, or simply 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 1 minute before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
1 \text{ pack of red beads} + 2 \text{ packs of clear beads} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[
3 \text{ packs of blue beads} + 4 \text{ packs of red beads} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. We do this by subtracting the total number of beads Elizabeth has from the total number of beads Margareth has:

\[
140 - 60 = 80
\]

Therefore, Margareth has \(\boxed{80}\) more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the house.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking:**
   Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Temperature increase per hour: 5 degrees
   - Total hours baking: 3 hours
   - Total temperature increase: \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ degrees} \)

   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window:**
   Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Cooling rate: 2 degrees every 10 minutes
   - Total time the window is open: 30 minutes
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes: \( \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals} \)
   - Total temperature decrease: \( 2 \text{ degrees/interval} \times 3 \text{ intervals} = 6 \text{ degrees} \)

   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

1. **Swim:**
   Jon's time: 40 minutes

2. **Bike Ride:**
   Jon's time: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes

3. **Run:**
   Jon's time: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon:
\[
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

James finished 10% faster in the swim and 5 minutes longer on the bike.

4. **Swim:**
   James's time: \(40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}\)

5. **Bike Ride:**
   James's time: \(80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}\)

Let \(x\) be the time James took for the run.

Total time for James:
\[
36 + 85 + x
\]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[
36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
121 + x = 180
\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[
\boxed{59}
\]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:
\[75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
\[\frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Hay per mile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3 \text{ per bail} = \$24

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with 50 eggs, given that each glass requires 5 eggs. We divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass: \(50 \div 5 = 10\) glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we need to find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses. We divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: \(10 \div 5 = 2\) trays.

Therefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, we calculate Joey's new total points after his turn in Scrabble. Joey initially has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points:

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, we calculate Marcy's new total points after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new totals to determine by how many points Joey is winning:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the cost per sneaker is:
\[
\frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each:
\[
17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store. Since 17 sneakers were sold at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers are:
\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers to the department store at $25 each is:
\[
31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total revenue from all sales is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:
\[
340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the salesman's profit is:
\[
\boxed{539}
\]"

\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons."
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of the super ticket option:
- The super ticket costs $20.
- The super ticket includes a popcorn and a soda for an additional $1.
- Therefore, the total cost of the super ticket option is $20 + $1 = $21.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the regular ticket option:
- The regular ticket costs $12.
- The popcorn and soda are bought at regular price.
- The soda costs $3.
- Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
- Therefore, the total cost of the regular ticket option is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, by not buying the super ticket, you saved $2. This means the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option:
\[ 21 - (15 + P) = 2 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):
\[ 21 - 15 - P = 2 \]
\[ 6 - P = 2 \]
\[ P = 6 - 2 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To find the total cost, we perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these together gives:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}
\]"
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. **First part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second part of the trip:**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we add the times to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

Finally, we calculate the average speed:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she will have:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 2 rubies she received. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}
\]"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

First, calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.
- Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.

Next, add the number of apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
- The total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days is \(120 + 120 = 240\).

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is given by:

\[
V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[
\boxed{1920}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards, and the number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

To find 60% of 15:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join the group. Half of 50 is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, 25 more fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, making the total number of fairies:

\[
50 + 25 = 75
\]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[
75 - 30 = 45
\]

The final number of fairies remaining is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of puppies from both Jennifer and Brandon.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Now, we perform the division and multiplication:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, we calculate the weekly earnings from recycling the aluminum cans and plastic bottles.

1. **Earnings from aluminum cans:**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

2. **Earnings from plastic bottles:**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles: \( 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \).

3. **Total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles: \( 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \).

4. **Earnings over four weeks:**
   - Total earnings over four weeks: \( 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \).

Thus, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

\]

Next, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
\]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. Finley started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she can't be in a negative position, she moves to the 6th place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(6 + 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 6th place.

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student receives 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards per student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After applying the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after applying the 10 percent discount, Kelly paid:

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum the number of each type of laundry item per room:
\[2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room}.\]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms:
\[15 \text{ pieces/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 1200 \text{ pieces of laundry}.\]

Thus, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is \(\boxed{1200}\)."

   240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday:**
   He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. Subtracting these from his current count:
   \[
   300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Thus, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, the number of pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year. Since there are 30 students and each student started with 10 pencils, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. Therefore, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]
So, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, we need to determine the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches/remora} \times 2 \text{ remoras} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches because the remora lengths are given in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. This is done by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the shark's body length and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is \(\boxed{10\%}\) of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide $300 by $15:
\[
\frac{300}{15} = 20
\]
So, Sarah bought 20 books.

Next, we need to divide the 20 books equally among her 4 kids. We do this by dividing 20 by 4:
\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5
\]
Therefore, each child received 5 books.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (the number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (the number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (the number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
\]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Next, we need to find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything. We know there are 32 kids in total, so we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[
\text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of employees.
   - Each group has 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees is \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(600 + 21 = 621\).

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. 

To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, and Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben. Therefore, we calculate:

\]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, and Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Jasper's yellow paint tubes} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes Jasper has to find the total number of paint tubes:

\[
\text{Total paint tubes Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11

"Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we start by calculating the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, the number of additional songs each can add is calculated by subtracting the number of songs they currently have from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to determine how much 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is. Since her shoes cost $80, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, since James runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse per day. Since each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse consumes:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses per day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption per day is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats are consumed by the horses over five days. The total consumption over five days is:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats. The number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the number of bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days is:

Therefore, the total amount Sally spends is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00
   \]

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" buying 2 packs means she only pays for 1 pack.
   \[
   \text{Cost after the sale} = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the $2.00 coupon from the sale price.
   \[
   \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors per pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per razor:**
   - Divide the total cost by the total number of razors.
   \[
   \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
   \]

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since $1.00 = 100 \text{ cents}$, $0.25 \text{ dollars} = 25 \text{ cents}$.
   \[
   0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches, as given in the problem.

In a human pyramid with the specified structure:
- 4 cheerleaders on the bottom
- 3 cheerleaders on top of the 4
- 2 cheerleaders on top of the 3
- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) on top of the 2

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, since the pyramid's height is determined by the topmost person.

The height of the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

"Let's denote Brett's current age as \( B \) and Angela's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Brett is currently 14 years old, so \( B = 14 \).

In four years, Brett's age will be \( B + 4 \). At that time, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + 4 = 3 \times B \]

Since \( B = 14 \), we substitute 14 for \( B \) in the equation:

\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently \(\boxed{38}\) years old."
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives in the morning for 14 days.

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[
6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives in the afternoon for 14 days.

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[
2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 14 \text{ rides} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[
84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box. Therefore, the total number of oranges Ashley brought is:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley. Therefore, the total number of oranges Brianne brought is:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the number of oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per person
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5n \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per person: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25n \)

We need to find the number of guests, \( n \), for which the total costs at both venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
200 + 5n = 25n
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
200 = 20n
\]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[
n = \frac{200}{20} = 10
\]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Together, they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \).
2. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \).
3. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \).

We can substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation. From \( L = D + 7 \) and \( B = 2D \), we substitute these into \( L + D + B = 43 \):

\[
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
4D + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
4D = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
D = 9
\]

Now that we know \( D = 9 \), we can find \( L \) and \( B \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]
\[
B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used, we need to calculate the amount each of them used and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ of a skein} \]
Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of yarn Mariah's grandma used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ of a skein} \]
So:
\[ \text{Yarn used by grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma to find the total:
\[ \text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ \boxed{273} \]"

\text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet, so we can calculate twice the width of the rug:

\[
2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:

\[
\text{Length of the couch} = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry and one pack each of grape and green apple.

The cost of the grape gum is given as $2. The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, so it is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost of the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2x + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 2 = 7 \]
\[ 2x + 4 = 7 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 3 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 1.5 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{1.5} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the number of sticks he can get from the cheapest lumber and see if he can afford enough of it with his $24 budget.

First, let's identify the cost and stick yield for each type of wood:
- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Since the 2 x 4 piece of wood is cheaper, we should prioritize buying as many of these as possible.

Next, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6
\]
So, Frederick can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. The total number of sticks from these pieces is:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200
\]

Since Frederick can afford 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood with his $24, he does not need to consider buying any 2 x 8 pieces of wood. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1200}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Next, we compare this cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to verify the number of cows in the zoo. According to the information, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to verify the number of sheep on the farm. According to the information, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on the information provided:

\[
4O = 12 \quad \text{(number of onions)}
\]
\[
4P = 4 \quad \text{(number of potatoes)}
\]

Next, we solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[
O = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]
\[
P = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these quantities together:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Thus, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, the total distance is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for 2 km. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, for 2 km she will need:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, we calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes:
\[ 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]
So, after buying clothes, Julie has:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]
Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
\[ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]
So, after buying CDs, Julie has:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Tara incurred for buying the canvas bags.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of canvas bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue Tara earned from selling the canvas bags.

She sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of punches Joe throws per round.
2. Multiply the number of punches per round by the number of rounds in the fight.

First, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. Each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the number of punches Joe throws in one round is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ punches/round} \]

Next, the fight consists of 5 rounds. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in the entire fight is:
\[ 75 \text{ punches/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, we determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of cookies Josh made} = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

Next, we find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of cookies Kelsie made} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:

"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = number of rows of red tulips + number of rows of blue tulips = 6 + 3 = 9.

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50. Therefore, her current daily cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00 \]

Next, we calculate her current weekly cost. Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly cost is:
\[ \$18.00 \times 7 = \$126.00 \]

Now, let's calculate her new daily consumption after adding the device. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \text{ kWh} + 2 \text{ kWh} = 14 \text{ kWh} \]

The new daily cost will be:
\[ 14 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00 \]

Her new weekly cost will be:
\[ \$21.00 \times 7 = \$147.00 \]

Finally, we find the difference between her new weekly cost and her original weekly cost:
\[ \$147.00 - \$126.00 = \$21.00 \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then the number of chairs she has is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]
The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]
Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( x \).

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 4 + x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 48 - 4 \]
\[ x = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44. Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $48. We need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $48. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $48 by $4:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. **Calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out for 4 hours:**
   - There are 8 weeks in total.
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.
   - Total hours for these 5 weeks: \(5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out for 5 hours:**
   - He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks.
   - Total hours for these 2 weeks: \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Calculate the hours for the week he worked out for 6 hours:**
   - He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.
   - Total hours for this 1 week: \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Sum up all the hours:**
   - Total hours = \(20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}\).

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Let the cost of one monitor be \( x \). Since Errol bought 2 monitors, the total cost for the monitors is \( 2x \).

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the monitors} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2x + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2x = 2400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2x = 600 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought back, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought back. According to the problem, each boy brought back 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought back. The problem states that each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought back as \( B \) and the number of seashells each girl brought back as \( G \). From the problem, we know:
\[ B = 60 \]
\[ G = B + 4B \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) into the equation for \( G \):
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"First, we determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original number of candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Nick had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, the number of candies Nick has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

The total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:

So, the tip amount is $10.

Now, we add this tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the wife wants to split the bill evenly, you would pay half of the total amount:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:
\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's determine how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets:

\[
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, making it:

\[
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

The following day, he added another $10, making his total:

\[
11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

He then spent $8, so his new total is:

\[
21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending $8, he tripled the amount he had left. Therefore, the amount he has now is:

\[
13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{39}

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half of April consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, in the second half of April, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he saves in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half. The total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he saves twice as much each day in the second half, he saves:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, the amount Elvis has to save each day in the second half of the month is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches that Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 \text{ (apples)} + \$4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + \$4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is:
\[
\boxed{7}

\[
\text{Jairus's total earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She completed 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's total earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money they have to divide is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times this amount is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \]

This means the sorted play set Jonathan wants to have has 400 toys. According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have enough for this sorted play set. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, the number of toys Jonathan currently has is \(\boxed{398}\)."

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so we have \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \) by first dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \frac{51}{3} = N + 7 \]
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Then, we isolate \( N \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[ 17 - 7 = N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."

   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per tooth}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, we can determine the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna based on the information provided.

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, the number of goals scored by Mark is:
\[ \text{Goals by Mark} = \text{Goals by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, the number of goals scored by Anna is:
\[ \text{Goals by Anna} = \text{Goals by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ \text{Total goals} = \text{Goals by Richie} + \text{Goals by Mark} + \text{Goals by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
\]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[
70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}

\[
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
\]

So, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:

- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to determine how many roses Ford grows in a week, which is 40 roses.

Now, we find the shortfall in roses per week:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses} \]

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the total shortfall per month:
\[ 25 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 100 \text{ roses/month} \]

Therefore, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To determine how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, we know that Katina removes $100 from her account every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, the total number of months is:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money removed over these 24 months:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times 100 \text{ dollars/month} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings of $3000:
\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine the net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = \( 10 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$7.00 \text{ per sandwich} = \$70.00 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of bread: Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = \( \frac{\$3.00}{10 \text{ sandwiches}} \times 10 \text{ sandwiches} = \$3.00 \).
   - The cost of cheeses and condiments: $30.00 for 10 sandwiches.
     - Cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches = \$30.00.
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = \( \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \).

3. **Calculate the net profit:**

"First, let's calculate the area of Michael's bedroom. The area is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given the dimensions of the bedroom are 18 feet by 12 feet, the area is:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for the new carpet, including the cost of the carpet itself and the padding. The cost per square foot for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Cost per square foot} = \$12 + \$2 = \$14 \]

So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is:

\[ \text{Total cost for carpet and padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$14/\text{square foot} = \$3024 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost for removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot for this service, so the total cost for removing the old carpet is:

\[ \text{Total cost for removing old carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

Finally, we need to calculate the cost for installing the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot for this service, so the total cost for installing the new carpet is:

\[ \text{Total cost for installing new carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$34/\text{square foot} = \$7344 \]

Adding all these costs together gives the total cost for replacing the carpet:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$3024 + \$864 + \$7344 = \$11232 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11232} \]"

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps to find the final value are as follows:

1. Calculate half of the starting value: \(\frac{x}{2}\).
2. Add this value to the starting value: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\).
4. Subtract 12 from the starting value: \( x - 12 \).
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4: \(\left(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\right) \times (x - 12)\).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

1. Calculate half of 20: \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\).
2. Add this value to 20: \(20 + 10 = 30\).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Subtract 12 from 20: \(20 - 12 = 8\).

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then calculated as:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature the oven would need to reach to be 4% too hot and equal 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, we have:

\[ x \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours is equal to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is \(\boxed{215}\) minutes."
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by noting that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. This means that Juan's house is 70% of the value of Herb's house.

First, we calculate the value of Juan's house:
\[
\text{Value of Juan's house} = 70\% \times 76000 = 0.70 \times 76000 = 53200
\]

Next, we find the combined value of both houses by adding the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[
\text{Combined value} = 76000 + 53200 = 129200
\]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:

"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to the event.

Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy brought:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} \]

Judy also bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, the number of dishes she brought is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cups and dishes Judy's friend brought.

Judy's friend brought 40 cups. Additionally, Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought:
\[ 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

The total number of cups brought by both is:
\[ 12 + 40 = 52 \text{ cups} \]

The total number of dishes brought by both is:
\[ 24 + 44 = 68 \text{ dishes} \]

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, we add the calories burned from both activities:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Now, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. We can set up the following proportion to find the total amount of water needed:

\[
\frac{100 \, \text{ml}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{x \, \text{ml}}{1600 \, \text{calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{100 \, \text{ml} \times 1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = \frac{160000 \, \text{ml}}{200} = 800 \, \text{ml}

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3B = 4500
\]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 1500
\]
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[
0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
The number of green jelly beans is:
\[
1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]
Thus, the number of green jelly beans that the jar contains more than the red jelly beans is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide the sum by the number of measurements (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

4. **Amount already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Hourly wage and required hours:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage.
   \[
   \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, George needs to work \(\boxed{260}\) hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle by \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"First, let's determine the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth 25 cents. Colby has 8 quarters.
  \[
  8 \times 25 = 200 \text{ cents}
  \]

- **Dimes**: Each dime is worth 10 cents. Colby has 6 dimes.
  \[
  6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ cents}
  \]

- **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth 5 cents. Colby has 14 nickels.
  \[
  14 \times 5 = 70 \text{ cents}
  \]

- **Pennies**: Each penny is worth 1 cent. Colby has 15 pennies.
  \[
  15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ cents}
  \]

Next, we sum up all the amounts to find the total amount of money Colby has:
\[
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}
\]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[
345 \div 5 = 69
\]

Therefore, Colby can buy \(\boxed{69}\) gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs. There are 5 dogs.
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats**: Each cat has 4 legs. There are 2 cats.
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Birds**: Each bird has 2 legs. There are 10 birds.
   \[
   10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

Now, we add the legs from all the pets together:
\[
20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
\]

Thus, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"1. Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.
2. He increases the weight by 50%. To find 50% of 8 pounds, we calculate \(8 \times 0.50 = 4\) pounds.
3. Adding this to the original weight, the new weight is \(8 + 4 = 12\) pounds.
4. The weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, the new weight is \(12 - 2 = 10\) pounds.

The weight that Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many games Steve has after 3 years.

1. **Initial Games on Birthday:**
   Steve receives 5 games on his birthday.

2. **Games Bought in the First Year:**
   Steve buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
   \[
   1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
   \]

3. **Games Bought in the Second Year:**
   Steve buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
   \[
   2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
   \]

4. **Games Bought in the Third Year:**
   Steve buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
   \[
   4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
   \]

5. **Games Received for Christmas:**
   Steve receives 5 games for Christmas each year for 3 years.
   \[
   5 \text{ games/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ games}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the games:
\[
5 \text{ (birthday)} + 12 \text{ (first year)} + 24 \text{ (second year)} + 48 \text{ (third year)} + 15 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
\]

Thus, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

we substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in one hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we first find out how many pounds Marissa makes in two hours:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in two hours} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour by dividing 90 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in one hour} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 45 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ \text{Pounds of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together, the total amount of chocolates they make together in 12 hours is:

\[ \text{Total pounds of chocolates} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{1260} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Howard spends each day at the arcade.

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Next, we add up the total amount spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours. Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. Therefore, the earnings for each hour are:

\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour} \]

Since he sold lemonade for 4 hours, the total earnings for the first four hours are:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours. Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. Therefore, the earnings for each hour are:

\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour} \]

Since he sold lemonade for 2 hours, the total earnings for the next two hours are:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00 \]

Adding the earnings from both periods, the total amount of money Patrick earned is:

\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"To determine how many years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per mile:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per mile} = 725
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per month} = 725 \times 400 = 290,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   \[
   \text{Rotations per year} = 290,000 \times 12 = 3,480,000
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{3,480,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 3
   \]

Thus, the tires will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. Therefore, the number of washings per pump is:

\[
\frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pumps are used per washing if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. Since each wash uses 1 pump, the cost per wash is based on the cost of 1 pump.

The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps that provide 120 washings:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
\]

Since we need the final answer in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the cost per pump is:

\[
\boxed{1200}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the price of the shirt after the discount is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount on them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the items is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since the question asks for the amount of money Joe will have left, and he will be short by $2.50, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   - Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ dozen/week}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants:**
   - It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
   - Juan needs to make 28 dozen croissants.
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants."
"First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter to repave. Therefore, the cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter to repave. Therefore, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \text{ meters} \times 194 \text{ dollars/meter} = 95060 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and repaving Monica's street:
\[ 95060 \text{ dollars} - 29100 \text{ dollars} = 65960 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is $65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{65960} \]"
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the cost step by step.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   John receives an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Duration of Research:**
   The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]
   Therefore, the research lasts for 50 months in total.

3. **Cost for the First 5 Months:**
   The cost for the first 5 months is $100,000.

4. **Cost for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   After the first 5 months, each subsequent month costs 50% more than the previous month. We need to calculate the cost for each of these 45 months.

   Let's denote the cost for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months as \( C_n \). The cost for the first of these 45 months (6th month) is:
   \[
   C_1 = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
   \]
   The cost for the second month (7th month) is:
   \[
   C_2 = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
   \]
   The cost for the third month (8th month) is:
   \[
   C_3 = 225,000 \times 1.5 = 337,500
   \]
   And so on. The cost for the \( n \)-th month is:
   \[
   C_n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^n
   \]

   The total cost for the remaining 45 months is the sum of a geometric series:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 45 months} = 150,000 + 225,000 + 337,500 + \cdots + 100,000 \times (1.5)^{45}
   \]

   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series \( a, ar, ar^2, \ldots \) is given by:
   \[
   S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
   \]
   Here, \( a = 150,000 \), \( r = 1.5 \), and \( n = 45 \):
   \[
   S = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{0.5} = 300,000 \left( (1.5)^{45} - 1 \right)
   \]

5. **Calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   \[
   S \approx 300,000 \left( 1,162,261.467 - 1 \right) = 300,000 \times 1,162,260.467 \approx 348,678,140.10
   \]

7. **Total Research Cost:**
   Adding the initial cost and the cost for the remaining 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 348,678,140.10 \approx 348,679,140.10
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{348,679,140.10}

"To determine the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Thus, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day. With 1000 members, the total number of posts per day is:
\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in March:
\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is:
\[ \boxed{93000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water Gary uses for laundry each week. Since he does laundry twice a week and each load uses 20 gallons of water, the total water usage per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water Gary uses in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total water usage per year is:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the water used for laundry in a year. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total cost is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is:
\[ \boxed{312} \]"
"To determine how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item she bought and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of the aquarium:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the aquarium} = \$10.00
   \]

2. **Cost of the rocks:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 bags of rocks} = 2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the coral:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 pieces of coral} = 3 \times \$2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. **Cost of the fish:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 20 fish} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10.00
   \]

5. **Cost of the fish food:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of fish food} = \$2.00
   \]

Now, we sum all these costs to find the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$10.00 + \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$2.00
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
\$10.00 + \$5.00 = \$15.00
\]
\[
\$15.00 + \$6.00 = \$21.00
\]
\[
\$21.00 + \$10.00 = \$31.00
\]
\[
\$31.00 + \$2.00 = \$33.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Scarlett spent is:
\[
\boxed{33}

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it grew to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. Each intersection has 6 poles.
3. There are 4 intersections.

So, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 4 \text{ (lights per pole)} \times 6 \text{ (poles per intersection)} \times 4 \text{ (intersections)} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are functioning. We know that 20 street lights are not working.

So, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ (total street lights)} - 20 \text{ (not working)} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining play times for each DVD and then sum them up.

1. The first DVD has been played 356 times and can be played a total of 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the first DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644
   \]

2. The second DVD has been played 135 times and can be played a total of 1000 times before it breaks. Therefore, the remaining play times for the second DVD are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865
   \]

3. The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the sum of the remaining play times for each DVD:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

Thus, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is \(\boxed{1509}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went twice a week for 2 hours each session.

Each session is 2 hours long, and he had 2 sessions per week. Therefore, the number of hours per week is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours over the 6 weeks is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour for the physical therapy sessions is $125. Therefore, the total cost for 24 hours is:

   Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner.
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces chewed on the way home and after dinner} = 1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Total pieces of gum chewed:**
   \[
   \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 \text{ (at school)} + 2 \text{ (on the way home and after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Gum remaining before giving to his sister:**
   \[
   \text{Gum remaining} = 20 \text{ (initial)} - 6 \text{ (chewed)} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Gum given to his sister:**
   Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.
   \[
   \text{Gum given to sister} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Gum remaining at the end of the day:**
   \[
   \text{Gum remaining} = 14 \text{ (remaining before giving)} - 7 \text{ (given to sister)} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. We do this by subtracting the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the basketball coach spent \(\boxed{85}\) dollars more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to determine the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden. Since there are 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is calculated as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed. Therefore, we calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \) of 200:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s:**
   - Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we divide the speed in kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

2. **Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Therefore, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
So, for the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week, we get:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more Adam needs to grow to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait \(\boxed{4}\) years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"First, let's calculate the total revenue James generated from selling the cars. He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

Next, we need to determine the total cost to the company for acquiring these cars. The company paid 30% of the price of each car:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

The total cost for the company to acquire 10 cars is:

\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

Now, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. Therefore, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the final amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many of the 100 riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since only 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so the remaining 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{40}{100} \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}
\]"

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, we add up all the stamps:
- Snowflake stamps: 16
- Truck stamps: 19
- Rose stamps: 10

The total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[16 + 19 + 10 = 45\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Determine the distance Bob is ahead:**
   - Distance = 75 miles

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the gap:**
   - Time = Distance / Relative speed
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"First, let's determine how many fish Darren caught. Since Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, and Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[ \text{Number of fish Darren caught} = 17 - 6 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."

2. **Determine the maximum allowable cost per class:**
   The maximum allowable cost per class is $10.

3. **Calculate the total number of classes:**
   There are 10 total classes.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can attend to keep the cost per class at or below $10:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can attend. The cost per class is given by:
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 10:
   \[
   6 \leq x
   \]
   This means Manny can attend at least 6 classes.

6. **Determine the number of classes Manny can miss:**
   If Manny can attend at least 6 classes, the number of classes he can miss is:
   \[
   10 - 6 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Manny can miss \(\boxed{4}\) classes before the cost per class exceeds $10."
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is the sum of the customers processed by each of them daily:
\[50 + 100 = 150\]

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is:
\[150 \times 7 = 1050\]

Thus, the total weekly production for the two is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify how many miles Paisley ran.
2. Calculate how many miles Reggie ran.
3. Use the information about Reggie's run to find out how many miles Lynn ran.

First, we know that Paisley ran 4 miles.

Next, we calculate how many miles Reggie ran. According to the problem, Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, we can express Reggie's run as:
\[ \text{Reggie's run} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's run} + 3 \]
Substituting the value of Paisley's run:
\[ \text{Reggie's run} = 5 \times 4 + 3 = 20 + 3 = 23 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know that Reggie ran 23 miles, which is 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can express Lynn's run as:
\[ \text{Lynn's run} = \text{Reggie's run} - 3 \]
Substituting the value of Reggie's run:
\[ \text{Lynn's run} = 23 - 3 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Lynn ran is:

   - Total sales over two months = Sales in the first month + Sales in the second month
   - Total sales over two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \)

Thus, the total amount Ariane made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."
"James hires the horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost for the first hour is $15.
- The cost for the next two hours is $30 per hour, so for two hours it is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

So, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week.
2. Identify the final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week.
3. Determine the amount of money that was added to her bank account during the week.
4. Calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount added to her bank account to find out how much was withheld.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week is $200.
2. The final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
3. The amount of money that was added to her bank account during the week is the final amount minus the initial amount:
   \[
   420 - 200 = 220
   \]
4. Sally's expected weekly wage is $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the amount added to her bank account:
   \[
   300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally's wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required for 48 halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
   \]

Thus, Lori will need \(\boxed{2}\) dozen eggs."
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we need to calculate the total number of days required for Mike to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

First, we calculate the total number of days required to read the book:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

Mike needs 20 days to complete the reading. The assignment is to be completed within 30 days. Therefore, we need to find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading:
\[
\text{Days before the deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, Mike will finish his reading \(\boxed{10}\) days before the deadline."
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   \[
   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger rental} = \$5000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
   \]

Next, we calculate the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane:
\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Monthly hanger rental} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first year (12 months):
\[
\text{Total annual maintenance cost} = 12 \times \$15,000 = \$180,000
\]

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost:
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Initial cost} + \text{Total annual maintenance cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
\]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"Let's denote the time it took to cook rice as \( R \), the time it took to cook pork as \( P \), and the time it took to cook beans as \( B \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. \( P = R + 20 \) minutes.
3. \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \) minutes.

First, we calculate the time it took to cook pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it took to cook beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the total time it took to cook all the food:
\[ R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts compared to a mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture:
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the mixture of \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts costs \( \boxed{3} \) dollars more than the mixture of \( \frac{1}{5} \) pound almonds and \( \frac{1}{3} \) pound walnuts."
"To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( s \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( g \) be the number of geese.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

Since each sheep and each goose has one head, we can write the first equation as:
\[ s + g = 20 \]

Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can write the second equation as:
\[ 4s + 2g = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[ 2s + g = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( s + g = 20 \)
2. \( 2s + g = 35 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2s + g) - (s + g) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2s + g - s - g = 15 \]
\[ s = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( s = 15 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( s = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( g \):
\[ 15 + g = 20 \]
\[ g = 5 \]

Now, we check the number of legs:
\[ 4s + 2g = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5:

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"

   \[
   \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600. The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209. Let's denote the number of newspapers delivered to District B as \( x \).

The equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ 600 = 198 + x + 209 \]

First, we add the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C:
\[ 198 + 209 = 407 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers:
\[ x = 600 - 407 \]
\[ x = 193 \]

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is \(\boxed{193}\)."

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:
\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total amount of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:
\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's summarize the information given:

- Total days in the month: 30 days
- Good days: 12 days
- Bad days: 8 days
- Neutral days: The rest of the days

We know the distribution of the first 24 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 8 bad days
- Following 8 days: 8 neutral days

Now, let's calculate the number of neutral days in the first 24 days:
\[ 8 \text{ (good)} + 8 \text{ (bad)} + 8 \text{ (neutral)} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Since the total number of days is 30, the number of neutral days in the first 24 days is:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ neutral days} \]

Now, we account for the next three days:
- Day 25: Good
- Day 26: Neutral
- Day 27: Good

Adding these to the counts:
- Good days: \(12 + 2 = 14\) (since 2 more good days are added)
- Neutral days: \(6 + 1 = 7\) (since 1 more neutral day is added)

We need to find out how many good days are left in the month. The total number of good days recorded is 14, and the total number of good days in the month is 12. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 14 - 12 = 2 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute \( J \) with 21:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the additional height the bamboo needs to reach 600 inches. This is calculated by subtracting the current height from the target height:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the additional height needed by the daily growth rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total dogs initially: \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - Total toys needed initially: 12.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James buys toys for the 12 dogs.
   - Total toys after first purchase: 12.

3. **Second Visit:**
   - There are twice as many more dogs as when he left.
   - Twice as many more dogs as 8 is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).
   - Total dogs now: \(12 + 16 = 28\).
   - Additional toys needed: \(28 - 12 = 16\).
   - Total toys after second purchase: \(12 + 16 = 28\).

4. **Third Visit:**
   - 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now: \(28 - 3 = 25\).
   - No additional toys are needed since the number of dogs is now 25 and he already has 28 toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"First, let's determine the total initial investment, which is $1200.

Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount. Therefore, Dylan's investment is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
\]

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:
\[
1200 - 480 = 720
\]

Frances then invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount. Therefore, Frances's investment is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
\]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:
\[
720 - 480 = 240
\]

This remaining amount is Skyler's investment. Therefore, Skyler's investment is:
\[
240
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by finding out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato as follows:

\[
\text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

Next, we use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[
\text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}

"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight (assuming Jack is also an adult):
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20 \, \text{kg}} \]"
"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of a variable. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. According to the problem, Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has \( C + 12 \) cookies. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has \( (C + 12) - 5 = C + 7 \) cookies. We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up the equation:

\[ C + 7 = 68 \]

To find \( C \), we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[ C = 68 - 7 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. Now we can find out how many cookies Max has:

\[ C + 12 = 61 + 12 = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies. Next, we need to find out how many cookies Summer has. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has:

\[ 73 + 23 = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies. Now we can find the total number of cookies by adding the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies of Katarina} + \text{Cookies of Max} + \text{Cookies of the Cookie Monster} + \text{Cookies of Summer} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together step by step:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \(\boxed{80}\) cm."
"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to first find the mowing rates for both modes.

1. **Calculate the mowing rate for ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in ""turtle"" mode.
   - Therefore, the mowing rate for ""turtle"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the mowing rate for ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in ""rabbit"" mode.
   - Therefore, the mowing rate for ""rabbit"" mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:**
   - Since the mowing rate for ""turtle"" mode is \(\frac{1}{60}\) lawns per minute, the time to mow half the lawn is:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine the time taken to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:**
   - Since the mowing rate for ""rabbit"" mode is \(\frac{1}{40}\) lawns per minute, the time to mow half the lawn is:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time taken to mow the entire lawn:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time taken in ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, we need to determine the total time John and Jack have already spent walking. They spent 6 minutes to get to the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. Adding these times together gives:

\[6 + 13 = 19 \text{ minutes}\]

John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school. If they have already spent 19 minutes walking, we can find out how much time they have left by subtracting the time already spent from the total time available:

\[30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the amount of time John and Jack have left to get to school without being late is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of fruit Catherine buys:

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

Next, we add up the costs of all the fruits to find the total amount Catherine pays:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair ate 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ \text{Cookies in the box} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the two twins, the younger triplet, and the older triplet is given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[ y + y + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2y + 2x + 7 = 44 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2y + 2x = 37 \]
Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ y + x = 18.5 \]

Since ages are typically whole numbers, and the problem does not specify otherwise, we can assume the problem is set up such that the ages are whole numbers. However, the equation \( y + x = 18.5 \) suggests a fractional age, which is unusual. Given the problem's context, we can infer that the problem might have a misinterpretation or a need for rechecking the setup, but based on the given setup, we solve for \( y \) and \( x \).

From \( y + x = 18.5 \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 18.5 - x \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) must be whole numbers, and the problem setup suggests a fractional solution, we can infer the closest whole number solution. However, the problem's setup implies a fractional age, so we solve for the closest whole number interpretation.

Given the problem's constraints and the setup, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends on his homework. 

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting 3 hours into minutes:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how much time John has left for a nap:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that the total cost of four candies is part of the $3.20, and the rest is the cost of the five lollipops.

The cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

So, the cost of the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

The cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins each month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months in 10 years is:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

The total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil after 10 years is:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \text{ dollars} \]

The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, so the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, so the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we find the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, so the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square in the quilted comforter.

1. **Red Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Blue Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of blue squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Green Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of green squares} = \text{Number of blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **White Squares:**
   \[
   \text{Number of white squares} = \text{Number of green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of squares to find the total area of the comforter:
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + \text{Number of blue squares} + \text{Number of green squares} + \text{Number of white squares}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to determine the number of bucks among the 50 deer. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points:**
   Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]

3. **Tom's Points:**
   Tom has 30 points less than Betty. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]

4. **Betty's Points (Recheck):**
   We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.

5. **Marta's Points:**
   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

Next, we sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. Therefore, the points the class is missing is:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{145}\) points to go on the trip."

   \]

Thus, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her $2400 paycheck for her car payment:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after funding her retirement and paying for her car. We subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

1. Identify the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males.
5. Sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

Given:
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
- There are 6 females and 8 males (including Larry).

First, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

Next, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:
\[ 8 \text{ males} \times 4 \text{ dumplings per male} = 32 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked:

"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the speed of the turtle and the time:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants:**
   \[
   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = 5 \times 3 = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = 4 \times 2.50 = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini Quiches:**
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = 3 \times 4 = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = 13 \times 1 = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times 50 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Next, we need to determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives 3 scoops, 2 sets will give:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."
"First, we need to determine the area that Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
\]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, the number of mosaic tiles required is:

\[
\text{Number of mosaic tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. The initial cost to go picking is $20, and then there's an additional cost of $1.5 per pound for the 30 pounds James picked.

The cost for the blueberries themselves is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the initial cost to go picking:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

Now, we find the difference between the cost of buying the blueberries at the store and the cost of picking them:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine the original price of each computer. The company had $700 planned for each computer. Since the price of each computer was 10% higher than planned, the new price per computer is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 0.10 \times 700 = 700 \times 1.10 = 770 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 500 \times 770 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total calories from each component of the omelet.

1. **Eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs: \( 6 \times 75 = 450 \) calories.

2. **Cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese: \( 2 \times 120 = 240 \) calories.

3. **Ham:**
   - John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz.
   - Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \) calories.

Now, we add up the calories from all components to find the total calories in the omelet:
\[ 450 \text{ (eggs)} + 240 \text{ (cheese)} + 80 \text{ (ham)} = 770 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[ \boxed{770} \]"

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
\[ 8 \text{ erasers} \times \$0.25 \text{ per eraser} = \$2.00 \]

Now, add the cost of the pencils and the erasers to find the total cost:
\[ \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00 \]

If you paid with $10, the change you would get is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of people who receive interviews. Since 30% of the 100 applicants receive interviews:

\[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 20% of the 30 people who received interviews get a job offer:

\[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of people who accept the position. Since a third of the 6 people who received a job offer accept it:

\[ 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2 \]

So, the number of people who accept the position is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of sacks of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother. Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, the total number of sacks given away is:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ sacks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice this corresponds to. Since each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice, the total kilograms of rice given away is:

\[ 7 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack} = 175 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"This week, Castle bought a total of \(3 + 5 = 8\) boxes of cereal. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. 

To find out how many more boxes of cereal she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

\[8 - 4 = 4\]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time each foot spends tapping at each rate:
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Her arms are raised for 2 minutes, so her arms are down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the total taps for each foot:
1. **Right foot:**
   - For 3 minutes with arms down: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
   - For 2 minutes with arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total taps for the right foot: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\)

2. **Left foot:**
   - For 3 minutes with arms down: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)
   - For 2 minutes with arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total taps for the left foot: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we sum the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 \text{ taps} + 1150 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}\]

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the total cost of having the city fix it versus the cost of Ron fixing it himself.

1. **Cost if the city fixes the pothole:**
   - The city does not charge Ron for fixing the pothole if they do it.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself:**
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:**
   \[
   120 + 75 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   \[
   450 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Net savings by fixing the pothole:**
   \[
   450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole."
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left.

First, let's find out how many normal chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's find out how many baby chairs are left:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- Therefore, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to get the total number of chairs left:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

So, the number of chairs the restaurant has left is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since three people each ate 8 slices, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since two people each ate 9 slices, the total number of slices eaten by the other two friends is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. 

To find the time the dog takes, we calculate:
\[
\text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the time taken by the cat and the time taken by the dog, and then dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 9x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately, and then sum these values.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 16 cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these 24 cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[
64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

Thus, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[
\boxed{112}

   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45

   Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 40\%
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Total people - People who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - Remaining people = Remaining people after midday - People who voted by 16:00
   - Remaining people = \(3000 - 2000 = 1000\)

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
2. Determine how many packs of gum are required based on the number of pieces per pack.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days. Since Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces needed by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

- **Kids:** 9 kids each want 2 smores.
  \[
  9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores}
  \]

- **Adults:** 6 adults each want 1 smore.
  \[
  6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores}
  \]

- **Total smores needed:**
  \[
  18 \text{ smores (kids)} + 6 \text{ smores (adults)} = 24 \text{ smores}
  \]

Next, we need to determine how many sleeves of graham crackers are required to make 24 smores. Each sleeve makes 8 smores.

- **Sleeves needed:**
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves}
  \]

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, they will need 1 box of graham crackers.

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, let's determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Dora's father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we need to find Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[
\text{Dora's mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

"First, let's determine the weight of each book:

- Cindy's math books weigh 2 pounds each. Since the problem does not specify the number of math books, we will assume she has 1 math book for simplicity, unless otherwise stated. So, the weight of the math book is 2 pounds.
- Cindy's science book weighs 2 pounds.
- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.
- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.
- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, her history book weighs \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

\[
2 \text{ (math book)} + 2 \text{ (science book)} + 4 \text{ (French book)} + 3 \text{ (English book)} + 6 \text{ (history book)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + (0.50 \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we can calculate Beck's initial number of apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, we determine how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{(number of books Steven has)} = 20 \]

Solving for the number of books Steven has:

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[
16 \times 3 = 48
\]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[
50 + 48 = 98
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[
\boxed{98}
\]"

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds were scared away. Subtract these from the initial number of birds:
\[
12 - 4 = 8
\]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 remaining birds. Add these together:
\[
8 + 20 = 28

"First, let's determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[
0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

This means there are 16 girls in each class. To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[
40 - 16 = 24
\]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara adds 3 more slices to the plate. So, the number of slices now is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
3. Mara then triples the number of slices she currently has. So, the number of slices now is:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
4. Mara eats 2 slices. So, the number of slices now is:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13
   \]
5. Her friend steals 5 slices. So, the number of slices now is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs she has.

1. **Dogs to be bathed:** 8
2. **Cats to have their nails clipped:** 5
3. **Birds to have their wings trimmed:** 3
4. **Horses to be brushed:** 12

Next, we sum these numbers to find the total number of grooming jobs:

\[
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28
\]

Melissa has 28 grooming jobs to complete over the course of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

\[
\frac{28}{7} = 4
\]

Thus, Melissa will groom \(\boxed{4}\) animals each day of the week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Mark incurred for buying the packs of old magic cards. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

Next, we need to determine the total value of the cards he received. Mark received 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000. Additionally, there are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. The total value of these 30 cards is:

\[
30 \times 50 = 1500
\]

Adding the values of all the cards together, we get:

\[
4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
\]

Now, we can find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
6500 - 5400 = 1100
\]

Thus, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

"First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

The cost for the first amusement park is:
- $26 per adult, so for 2 adults: \(26 \times 2 = 52\)
- $12 per child, so for 2 children: \(12 \times 2 = 24\)

Adding these together, the total cost for the first amusement park is:
\[52 + 24 = 76\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park for 2 adults and 2 children.

The cost for the second amusement park is:
- $14 per adult, so for 2 adults: \(14 \times 2 = 28\)
- $10 per child, so for 2 children: \(10 \times 2 = 20\)

Adding these together, the total cost for the second amusement park is:
\[28 + 20 = 48\]

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two amusement parks:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, the family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each and now buys them for $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the vendor saves in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. We know that Sean has 56 marbles and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224
\]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112
\]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined. We do this by adding the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has:

\[
\text{Total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many students will be in each of the six groups. Since there are fifty-four students and they are to be separated into six groups of equal size, we divide fifty-four by six:

\[
\frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

So, each of the six groups will have 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many groups are required if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the problem states that 12 groups are needed, we need to determine how many more groups are needed beyond the six groups that are already formed.

To find the number of additional groups needed, we subtract the number of groups already formed from the total number of groups required:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during the weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during the weekend in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bananas Gunther has in the end.

1. Initially, Gunther has 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas after adding} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]
4. Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther adds another 6 bananas:
   \[
   \text{Final number of bananas} = 37 + 6 = 43

"First, let's calculate the monthly share of the electricity bill for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent for the event.

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of glasses and plates as follows:

- Total glasses: \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \)
- Total plates: \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \)

Next, we need to account for the items that were broken. According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, we subtract these from the initial totals:

- Remaining glasses: \( 96 - 10 = 86 \)
- Remaining plates: \( 48 - 6 = 42 \)

Now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together to find the total number of items Jeff has now:

- Total remaining items: \( 86 + 42 = 128 \)

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{128}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button, so 27 small buttons are worth \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers left and \(40 + 9 = 49\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers is \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers are worth 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large stickers left and \(49 + 24 = 73\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - She trades the remaining 25 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 25 large stickers are worth \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(73 + 75 = 148\) large buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 148 large buttons and 0 small buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 148.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{148}\)."

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches played on each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \). Substituting the value of \( x \) we found:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
11 \text{ (extra-small)} + 22 \text{ (small)} + 18 \text{ (medium)} + 9 \text{ (large)} + 15 \text{ (extra-large)} = 75

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to find out the total time these songs will last. Since each song is 10 hours long, the total time for 6000 songs is:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:

\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win the race. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves us with:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people who do not think horse #2 will win:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of Pomeranians Jana has as \( P \).

According to the problem, one third of the Pomeranians are girls. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3}P = 6
\]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
P = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( T \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{2}{3}T = 18
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
T = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
\]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is:
\[
\boxed{27}

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him to find out how much money Jayden has in total:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The first house needs \( x \) cases.
- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the first house needs half of the second house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since the third house needs double the first house).

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so we calculate:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Thus, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, so her total earnings for Monday are \( 75 + 5 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5, so her total earnings for Wednesday are \( 30 \) dollars.

Now, let's add her earnings from both days:

- Total earnings for Monday and Wednesday are \( 80 + 30 = 110 \) dollars.

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \( \boxed{110} \) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold. Since they sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold. Since they sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, the total number of fruity scents sold is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. We do this by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of vanilla scents sold more than the fruity scents is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount of money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135. To find out how much more money he needs to make from selling the ears of corn, we subtract the money he already made from the total amount he wants to make:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount of money he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:

\[ 75 \div 25 = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can determine the time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on video games and reading from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the total time available (12 hours) and the time spent playing soccer (6 hours):

\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon. Since he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon. This means the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Brandon is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. We calculate:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie. This means the number of pencils remaining after giving some to Charlie is:

\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"

3. **Calculate the total driving time:**
   - Total driving time: \(2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}\)

4. **Add the time spent at the museum:**
   - Time spent at the museum: 6 hours
   - Total time gone from home: \(4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}\)

Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."
"To determine the total number of wheels needed to assemble the toys, we start by calculating the wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately.

First, we calculate the wheels needed for the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we calculate the wheels needed for the motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles to find the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels available:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ \boxed{276} \]"
"First, calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage:

\[ 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, you have to pay $800."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]

8. **Cost of normal movies**: Each normal movie costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for normal movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

9. **Total cost**: Add the costs of all the movies.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400
   \]

Thus, the total cost to replace Mike's movie collection with digital versions is:
\[
\boxed{4400}

"To determine how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Next, we sum the total costs for each type of fruit:
\[
\$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Winston spent on fruit is \(\boxed{38}\)."
"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance traveled by car and the distance hiked, then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled by car. The family drove for a certain number of hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. We need to find out how many hours they drove. The total travel time is 6 hours, and they hiked for 1.5 hours. Therefore, the time spent driving is:
\[ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

The distance traveled by car is:
\[ \text{Distance by car} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked. The average hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Half the driving speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour} \]
So, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The distance hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance traveled by car and the distance hiked:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

Let:
- \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- \( E_t \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- \( A_t \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the relationships between the variables:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each friend ordered, which is given as 30 dollars. Since the total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars, we can find the combined cost of the other two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost.

The combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the combined cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
\[ \frac{34}{2} = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, for these 5 days, the total number of rides is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days. So, on these two days, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
Thus, for these 2 days, the total number of rides is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days gives the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]
We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ O = 17 - W \]
Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
Isolate \( W \):
\[ 17 - 5 = 3W \]
\[ 12 = 3W \]
\[ W = 4 \]
Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):
\[ O = 17 - 4 \]
\[ O = 13 \]
So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

   - Price of gas: $3 per gallon
   - Total cost: \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters. 

The value of the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent all the quarters and \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties.

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start by calculating the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

First, we know that one-fourth of the total sales are smart TVs. Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of smart TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we know that one-eighth of the total sales are analog TVs. Therefore, the number of analog TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

The rest of the TVs sold are OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[
40 - 10 - 5 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money needed for the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs to raise.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[
\text{School contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise. John has $50, and the school will contribute $150, so the total amount covered by John and the school is:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]

The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John is still missing is:
\[
300 - 200 = 100
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[
\boxed{100}

"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, the number of logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by the size of each group:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of groups that brought seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[
\text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"First, we need to determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and her special hourly rate for additional hours.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of the 11 hours she worked were regular hours and how many were additional hours. Since she works 8 regular hours each day, the number of additional hours she worked is:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate her pay for the regular hours and the additional hours separately and then sum them up.

For the regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars per hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars per hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives her total pay for the day:

\[12 + 6 + 14 = 32\]

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[
\text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Determine the total amount paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total amount paid over three months.**

The total amount paid over three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}\).

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is \(240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds}\).

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:
- Total caroling time = \(300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}\).

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is \(\boxed{540}\) seconds."
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:
\[
\text{Earnings for Billy} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
\]

Now, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:
\[
\text{Earnings for Sally} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
\]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:
\[
\text{Difference in earnings} = \$230 - \$210 = \$20
\]

Thus, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread. Each loaf costs $2, so:
\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2/\text{loaf} = \$6 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1/\text{bagel} = \$2 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the 3 loaves of bread cost compared to the 2 bagels:
\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many points Nikita scored. According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[
\frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[
139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we need to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita. We add Pierson's points to Nikita's points:
\[
278 + 150 = 428
\]

Thus, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[
\boxed{428}
\]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(3 \times 40 = 120\).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \(120 \times 2 = 240\).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:
- The total number of trees planted is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

Thus, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is \(\boxed{1240}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

To solve for \( x \), first distribute the 0.30:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have 14 days. Therefore, the total hours played in the first part is:

\[
0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the second part is:

\[
2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours}
\]

Now, we add the hours from both parts to find the total hours played so far:

\[
7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours}
\]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

\[
30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours}
\]

So, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the first car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance traveled by the second car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - The second car is ahead of the first car by the difference in the distances they have traveled:
     \[
     \text{Separation} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, after 2 hours, the two cars will be separated by \(\boxed{20}\) miles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on this total cost. A 30% premium means that James pays an additional 30% of $900. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original total cost of the materials to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

First, let's determine the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \(\frac{40}{100} = 0.4\) or 40%
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \(2 \times 0.4 = 0.8\) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed:
  \[
  340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680
  \]

- Total number of students:
  \[
  500 \text{ (third-graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 1000
  \]

Now, we find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
\]

Thus, the school's overall pass rate is \(\boxed{68\%}\)."
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag contains 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   \[
   72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine how many glass chips are needed for each square inch of the mosaic:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make each square inch.

3. **Calculate the total number of square inches Milo can cover with 144 glass chips:**
   \[
   \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation to find the length \( L \):**
   \[
   L \times 3 = 12
   \]

6. **Solve for \( L \):**
   \[
   L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is \(\boxed{4}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially planned to sell 100 butterscotch candies but ended up selling 150. After selling these 150 candies, he ordered 100 more. 

First, we calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
\[ 150 \text{ (sold)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 250 \text{ candies} \]

Since Dale has sold 150 candies out of the 250 he now has, we need to find out how many he still needs to sell:
\[ 250 \text{ (total)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 100 \text{ candies} \]

So, Dale still needs to sell \(\boxed{100}\) candies."
"To determine the number of additional students that join by the end of May, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the beginning of the year.

1. ** Beginning of the year (January 1):**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 10
   \]

2. ** End of January:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

3. ** End of February:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

4. ** End of March:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

5. ** End of April:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 80 \times 2 = 160
   \]

6. ** End of May:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = 160 \times 2 = 320
   \]

Now, we need to find the additional number of students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students at the beginning of the year:
\[
\text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 = 310
\]

Thus, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is:
\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \div 0.25 = 105 \times 4 = 420
\]

So, Felix climbed 420 branches during the week.

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

1. **First batch of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. **Second batch of flowers:**
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. **Third batch of flowers:**
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. **Fourth batch of flowers:**
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Next, we sum these totals to find the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower from each batch. We need to calculate the number of petals on these dropped flowers:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

Summing the petals of the dropped flowers:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtract the petals of the dropped flowers from the total number of petals:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John and DeSean each made 9 S'mores, so together they used:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Thus, the number of S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each of them can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total number of quarters each person uses in 4 hours (240 minutes):

1. Jack: \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
2. Each of the two friends who can play for 10 minutes: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters each.
3. The friend who can play for 30 minutes: \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

Now, we sum up the total number of quarters used:

\[
12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68
\]

So, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\) quarters."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ 4z + 2z + z + z + 2z = 10 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"John buys 3 goats at $500 each and 2 cows at $1500 each. 

The total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars. 

The total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars. 

Adding these amounts together, the total money spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
4500"
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we add the cupcakes he already has and subtract this number from the total needed.

First, we add the cupcakes he already has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. According to the problem, Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount raised by each student is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To determine the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we need to calculate the time she walked each day and then sum these times.

First, we know that on the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. We need to convert this time into minutes:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that on the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. Therefore, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]
We convert this time into minutes as well:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time she walked on both days to find the total time:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} + 240 \text{ minutes} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **First Break Count**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Lunch Break Count**: During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
   Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle of work. Each cycle consists of 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. Therefore, the payment for one cycle is:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much John makes in a single day. Since he does 30 cycles of work each day, the daily earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \]

Finally, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ 7 \text{ days} \times \$180.00 \text{ per day} = \$1260.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
     \[
     \text{Julie's score in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - The second game was at Julie's home court.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Sasha Scored:**
   - Add the points from both games.

     \text{Total points} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 8 packages of cat food and each package contained 11 tins, the total number of tins of cat food is:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. Since she bought 6 packages of dog food and each package contained 6 tins, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. We do this by subtracting the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And we can find out how many cards Becca has:

\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

\[ \boxed{153} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy had 5 green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Green eggs} = 5
   \]

2. **Blue Eggs**: Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones.
   \[
   \text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times \text{Green eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs**: Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Pink eggs} = \text{Blue eggs} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs**: Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Pink eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = \text{Green eggs} + \text{Blue eggs} + \text{Pink eggs} + \text{Yellow eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy had is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound for the weight of the book and $0.08 per mile for the distance to the distribution center.

The weight of the book is 4 pounds, so the cost for the weight is:

\[ \text{Weight cost} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]

The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles, so the cost for the distance is:

\[ \text{Distance cost} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]

The total shipping cost is the sum of the weight cost and the distance cost:

\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the total shipping cost:

\[ \text{Money lost} = 3.00 - 24 = -21 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Milly will actually gain $21 after the refund and the shipping cost. However, the question asks for the money Milly will lose, which in this context means the absolute value of the negative result, but since the refund is greater than the shipping cost, Milly will not lose any money and will have a net gain.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Mulan initially has $40. Her father gave her an additional $100. So, the total amount of money she has before her purchases is:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

Next, she buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. The cost for the bag is:
\[ 20 \]

The total amount spent on the jeans and the bag is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the total amount of money she had initially:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mulan has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First week production:**
   \[
   \text{First week production} = 8,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Second week production:**
   \[
   \text{Second week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{First week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third week production:**
   \[
   \text{Third week production} = 3 \times \text{First week production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total production for the first three weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = \text{First week production} + \text{Second week production} + \text{Third week production}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total monthly production:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly production} = 50,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

6. **Fourth week production:**
   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = \text{Total monthly production} - \text{Total production for the first three weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then for four weeks.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week = \( 18 \times 4 = 72 \) minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Total time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week.
   - Total time spent doing makeup per week = \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \) minutes.

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities per week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes (recording)} + 120 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 90 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes per week} \]

Now, we calculate the total time spent in a month with four weeks:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is:
\[ \boxed{1128} \]"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. Angela needs additional installations:
   - 2 more mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
   - 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
   - 10 more pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Now, let's add these additional costs to the base installation cost:

\[ 129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324 \]

So, the total cost for Angela will be \( \boxed{324} \) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches high.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches high.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches high.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to calculate the distance he covered in each segment of his journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum of distances from both segments: \( 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \)

Thus, the total distance Mason has traveled is \(\boxed{80}\) miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across the highway, the total travel time for one kangaroo would also be 18 hours, since they are all traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance.

The speed of one kangaroo can be calculated as the distance divided by the time. Let the distance be \(D\) and the speed of one kangaroo be \(S\). Then, we have:
\[ S = \frac{D}{18} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\), given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. The speed of one turtle is:
\[ \frac{S}{2} = \frac{D}{18 \times 2} = \frac{D}{36} \]

The time \(T\) it takes for one turtle to travel the distance \(D\) is:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\frac{D}{36}} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since the four turtles are traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance, the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance is the same as the time it takes for one turtle, which is 36 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of clay dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, Rory makes:
   \[
   20 + 20 = 40 \text{ dishes}
   \]
3. Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory. Therefore, Jada makes:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dishes}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[
20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"First, let's determine the reduced price of the laptop after the trade-in. The original price of the laptop is $600, and the trade-in discount is $200. Therefore, the reduced price is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount of money she currently has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom. Let's denote the amount of money she has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money she has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, each sliced into 5 pieces, Adam gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, each sliced into 3 pieces, Adam gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. Therefore, with 3 cows, the farmer currently produces:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. **First glue stick:**

   - Length left: \( 12 \times \frac{1}{6} = 2 \) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Fraction left: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Length left: \( 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 \) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Fraction left: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Length left: \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is left in all three glue sticks:
\[ 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{16}\) millimeters."

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Total cost - Total money Gabriel has = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To determine how much change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by 20:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract 70 from 80:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[
\text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total number of students} - (\text{Number of students good at math only} + \text{Number of students good at English only})
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math. This includes those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[
\text{Total number of students good at math} = \text{Number of students good at math only} + \text{Number of students good at both}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total number of students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the number of students good at math is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. This is given by:

\[ 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission time, which is 10 minutes. The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to determine how many 10-minute segments fit into the 120 minutes of the concert, including the intermission. Since the intermission is a fixed part of the schedule, we subtract it from the total time to find the time available for the groups to perform:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the available time by the time required for one group to perform:

\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years. The rate can be expressed as a decimal:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \]

Now, we can substitute the values into the simple interest formula:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]

First, calculate the interest for one year:
\[ 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \]

Then, calculate the total interest for 3 years:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the original principal plus the total interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Next, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average cost per pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- You are buying 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

First, find the total cost without the discount:
\[
3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Then, apply the $2 discount for each of the 3 baskets:
\[
3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Subtract the total discount from the total cost without the discount:
\[
54 - 6 = 48

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean these rooms in minutes.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

First, we find one-half of the 90 rooms:
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean 45 rooms, given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:
\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[

- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person in question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87, \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87. \]

Add 9 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6B = 96. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 16. \]

Now, substitute \( B = 16 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for the class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate the total number of glue sticks as follows:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra left over.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial amount of water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After the first day of heavy rain:**
   The amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the third day:**
   The amount of water increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[
\boxed{14000}
\]"
"To determine how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

1. **Day 0 (Initial Infection):**
   - Initially, 10 people are infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
   - Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

3. **Day 2:**
   - Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\).
   - Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

4. **Day 3:**
   - Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
   - Number of new infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).
   - Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800
\]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
0.10 \times 800 = 80
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 - 80 = 720
\]

Now, we add the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so the difference is:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, the total number of loaves is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"First, let's calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students. With 50 students each given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we add the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate to the total consumed by the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of green cars:**
   - The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars.
   - Number of red cars = 12.
   - Number of green cars = \(12 - 2 = 10\).

2. **Determine the number of blue cars:**
   - The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
   - Number of green cars = 10.
   - Number of blue cars = \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

3. **Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:**
   - Number of red cars = 12.
   - Number of green cars = 10.
   - Number of blue cars = 30.
   - Total number of red, green, and blue cars = \(12 + 10 + 30 = 52\).

4. **Determine the number of yellow cars:**
   - The total number of cars in the rink is 75.
   - Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars - Number of red, green, and blue cars.
   - Number of yellow cars = \(75 - 52 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).
3. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13. \]

Now, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the third equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85, \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85. \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84. \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28. \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"First, let's determine the weight of the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, and the potatoes weigh 5 pounds, the sweet potatoes weigh:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find the weight of the carrots. The carrots weigh 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. Since the sweet potatoes weigh 10 pounds, the carrots weigh:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the carrots that Daisy bought is:

"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Since each box is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \text{ dollars} \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the $4000:
\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the seller will give back \(\boxed{500}\) dollars in change."
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost. We calculate Keenan's share as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400 and there are 4 weeks in the month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. We divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 pieces:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]

After the first day, the number of pieces left is:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:
\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]

On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining 26 pieces:
\[
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

Now, we sum up all the pieces Tobias ate over the three days:

     \]

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is:
     \[
     \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \text{ dollars per bottle}
     \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - Each bottle of soda costs $3.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
     \[
     3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - Each bottle of water costs $2.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 bottles of water is:

"First, let's break down the costs of each item Kelly is purchasing:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \(2 \times \frac{10}{5} = 2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
   - Kelly buys 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly buys 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) dollars.
   - Kelly buys 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani started with 55 cookies and ate 5, so she had \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies left. She then placed these 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. Therefore, the number of cookies in each jar is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
10
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have \(\boxed{15}\) more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the speed at which a whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of a thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of a thingamabob to find the speed of a whatchamacallit.
3. Use the speed of a whatchamacallit to find the speed of a whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of a thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of a whirligig by multiplying the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of a whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the yogurt:**
   The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad. Since the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   The total cost of the salad and yogurt is:
   \[
   6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the carrots:**
   Ellen pays $11 in total for her daily food. The cost of the salad and yogurt together is $9, so the cost of the carrots is:
   \[
   11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Find the cost of one carrot:**
   Ellen eats two carrots every day, so the cost of one carrot is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Therefore, the cost of one carrot every day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine Mark's new hourly wage. He used to make $10 per hour and his pay was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours he works in a week is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find out how much Mark makes in a week by multiplying his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mark makes a week is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). According to the problem, the first week she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6x \). The total amount Tasha earned from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is \( 6 \times 3x + 6 \times 5x = 18x + 30x = 48x \).

The total earnings from all her work is the sum of the earnings from mowing Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns, which is given as $80. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6x + 48x = 80 \]
\[ 54x = 80 \]
\[ x = \frac{80}{54} = \frac{40}{27} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales. The total earnings from all her work is $80, and the earnings from mowing lawns is \( 6x + 48x = 54x = 80 - \text{lemonade sales} \). Since we already calculated \( 54x = 80 \), the amount made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 80 = 0 \]

However, the correct interpretation is that the total earnings from mowing lawns is $80, and there is no additional earnings from lemonade sales mentioned in the problem. Therefore, the amount made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"First, let's determine Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, and Martin's weight is 55 kg, we can calculate Carl's weight as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we determine Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour.

The total hours he rents out the car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Since he earns $25 per hour, his total earnings from renting the car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500.

So, his profit is:
\[ 750 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can set up the following equation to find the number of notebooks she originally had:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} + 5 = 7 \]

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Original number of notebooks Martha had} = 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. According to the problem, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, the number of notebooks Joseph had is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has now compared to Joseph. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. The difference is:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has \(\boxed{1}\) more notebook than Joseph."
"First, we need to determine how many miles Anis rowed. According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Dijana rowed 50 miles, so we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed as follows:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance they rowed together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"First, we need to determine how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. Initially, Susan made 100 cookies. After her husband took 4 cookies, the number of cookies left is:
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Next, we need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:
\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. 

Final numerical answer:
\[15\]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to find the total amount of soup. Therefore, the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bowls of soup that will be consumed by Calvin and his family. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have two children. If each person has one bowl of soup, the total number of bowls consumed is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} + 2 \text{ (children)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot contains enough soup for 4 adult bowls, and 4 bowls are consumed by the family, there is no leftover soup. Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is:
\[ 0 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50. 

The cost for the notebooks is \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\).

The cost for the ballpen is \(0.50\).

So, the total amount William spent is \(7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00\).

**Final Answer:**
8.00"
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we need to find out how much material is required for 20 small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can calculate the material needed for one small mask:
\[
\text{Material for one small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
\]
Therefore, the material needed for 20 small masks is:
\[
\text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much material is required for 8 large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can calculate the material needed for one large mask:
\[
\text{Material for one large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
\]
Therefore, the material needed for 8 large masks is:
\[
\text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to find the total material required:
\[
\text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of hours Harold sleeps in a day. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.

Next, we calculate the number of hours Harold works. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Harold also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we need to find out the total number of hours Harold spends on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleep)} + 8 \text{ hours (work)} + 1 \text{ hour (dog walk)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total hours spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"First, let's calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his 30 marbles to Jamie:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Next, we subtract these 6 marbles from Dean's original 30 marbles:

\[
30 - 6 = 24
\]

Now, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. We subtract these 10 marbles from the 24 marbles Dean has left:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Colby earns for completing 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for each package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \times 0.20 = 64 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate the time for the extreme sudoku as follows:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is:

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We are also given that there are 20 red balloons.

First, we can express the total number of pieces of bologna thrown in terms of \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]
Since \( R = 20 \), we substitute 20 for \( R \) in the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]
Next, we solve for \( Y \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( \boxed{6} \)."
"First, calculate the total miles Jon drives in a 30-day month. Since he drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in a month is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, determine how many tune-ups Jon needs. Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine how many hours Bruce works each day.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up the hours worked over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then find out how much each received initially.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total expenditure:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to make this purchase, the total amount of their allowances is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought:

- Apples: 3
- Bananas: 5

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = \( 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pets Larry has in total.

1. **Cats**: Larry has 3 cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 3
   \]

2. **Dogs**: Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Rabbits**: Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Fish**: Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21

Thus, the total number of pets Larry has is:
\[
\boxed{47}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many slices of bread Josh can eat in a day. Since Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, and Abby can eat 2 slices a day, Josh can eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices a day.

Next, we need to find out how many slices of bread both Abby and Josh can eat together in one day. Together, they can eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices. To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they can eat together in one day. So, we calculate \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to calculate the number of months from when she turned 5 years old to her 10th birthday.

1. Martha started collecting shells at age 5.
2. She will have been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years.
3. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.
4. Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected is 60.

Thus, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"First, we need to determine how many cups are in each row. Since Lana has 27 cups and divides them into 3 rows, we calculate the number of cups per row as follows:

\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
\]

Next, we know that in each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal. Therefore, in each row, the number of chamomile tea cups is equal to the number of mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( x \). Consequently, the number of mint tea cups in each row is also \( x \).

Since the total number of cups in each row is 9, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 9
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
2x = 9
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Thus, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground in order to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of berries needed per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, we need to determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons of water, the tank will have:

\[
\frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days. The total amount of water emptied in 6 days is:

\[
500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank, we get:

\[
5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent so far this month.

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays.
   - Each ticket costs $10.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - Colby has seen 8 movies on other days.
   - Each ticket costs $7.
   - Total spent on these movies: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Popcorn:**
   - Colby has had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Each tub costs $8.
   - Total spent on popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.

4. **Candy:**
   - Colby has had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Each box costs $2.
   - Total spent on candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's sum up all the expenses:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby's parents give him $150 each month to spend. Therefore, the remaining amount of money he has is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\] dollars.

Now, let's determine how many movies Colby can see with the remaining $20. Since it is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can only see movies on Friday or Saturday, where each ticket costs $10.

To find out how many movies he can see, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[20 \div 10 = 2\] movies.

Since he wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy that night, we need to subtract the cost of one popcorn and one box of candy from the remaining $20:
\[20 - (8 + 2) = 20 - 10 = 10\] dollars.

With $10 left, he can see one more movie:
\[10 \div 10 = 1\] movie.

Therefore, the total number of movies Colby can see that night is:
\[1\] movie.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"

   \]

2. **Calories in a mini cinnamon roll:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Total calories for 200 mini cinnamon rolls:**
   \[
   200 \text{ rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/roll} = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Calories in a normal blueberry muffin:**
   \[
   450 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. **Calories in a mini blueberry muffin:**

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - **Monday:** 39 Junebugs
   - **Tuesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Wednesday:** Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - **Thursday:** 48 Junebugs
   - **Friday:** 57 Junebugs

2. **Sum the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

3. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   \[
   39 + 78 = 117
   \]
   \[
   117 + 78 = 195
   \]
   \[
   195 + 48 = 243
   \]
   \[
   243 + 57 = 300
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5}

Thus, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"First, calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the bus = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

Next, calculate the distance traveled by the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance traveled by the car = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by the bus - Distance traveled by the car
- Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to first calculate the total number of toys Sophie already had before adding the bouncy balls. We know the following:

- The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
- The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
- The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.

Adding these together gives us the total number of toys before the bouncy balls were added:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie's total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62. Let \( x \) be the number of bouncy balls. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 48 + x = 62 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 48 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 62 - 48 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute the expression for \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( Pa \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( J = 20 \) back into the expressions for \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of water balloons each person initially received. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, and she had 1 for herself. So, initially, the total number of water balloons is:

\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} + 1 \text{ balloon for Maria} = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), the additional number of balloons is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial number of balloons to the additional balloons gives the total number of balloons:

\[ 9 \text{ initial balloons} + 15 \text{ additional balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes already owned by the charity group.

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes, so the total number of donated boxes is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They already have 10 boxes.

Adding these together, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

- The total number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:

- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
- Combined total distance: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(60 \times 24 \times 30\).

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- For 30 days, the total number of widgets produced is \(45 \times 24 \times 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ widgets}\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32400 \text{ widgets}\]

Now, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
\[43200 \times 6 = 259200 \text{ dollars}\]

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[32400 \times 6 = 194400 \text{ dollars}\]

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

\[259200 - 194400 = 64800 \text{ dollars}\]

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This means he stays from 5 pm to 10 am, which is 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For every hour after the 12-hour mark, there is an additional charge of 70 pesos.

The number of hours after the initial 12-hour period is:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for these additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would have been 1600 pesos. The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total amount of hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall total:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John then wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so his remaining money after the deposit is:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each, so the total cost of the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money John has is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we add the total number of letters spelled by Craig and his brother to find the total number of letters spelled after the ten rounds:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To determine the total number of children participating in the mass drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

3. Therefore, the number of children in one school is calculated as follows:
   \[
   8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children/school}
   \]
4. There are 5 different schools participating.
5. Therefore, the total number of children from all schools is:
   \[
   56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. Therefore, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students. There are 29 students, and each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles obtained from the coupons:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours).
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Fixed Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost} = \$40 + \$105 + \$60 = \$205
\]

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15/\text{CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price. So, we calculate 60% of $150:

\[ 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90 \]

This is the total amount James spends on the CDs. Now, he decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40/\text{CD} = \$200 \]

To find out how much money James is out of pocket, we subtract the amount he gets from selling the CDs from the amount he spent on them:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually has an extra $110 after selling the CDs. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context means the absolute value of the amount he spent minus the amount he received from selling the CDs. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, Jen will earn a total of \(\boxed{34}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:
\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for him to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, James rests for half as long as his swimming time. Therefore, his rest time is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to swim the remaining distance. The remaining distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims the remaining distance at half his original speed, his new speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times to find the total time taken to get across the lake:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

   \text{Sam's loaves} = 70
   \]

2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has \(\boxed{450}\) loaves of bread."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jasmine starts with 15 stickers.
2. She loses 7 stickers during playtime. So, we subtract 7 from 15:
   \[
   15 - 7 = 8
   \]
3. Her teacher then gives her 5 more stickers for helping her classmates. So, we add 5 to the 8 stickers she has left:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

Therefore, at the end, Jasmine has \(\boxed{13}\) stickers."
"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

1. Calculate Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

2. Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times \text{Marcus's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

To verify, we check the total points:
\[ B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]
The total is correct. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages occupy 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages/inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of each sheet:**
   - Each sheet of paper has 2 pages (one on each side).
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages is:
     \[
     75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. minus 5 minutes is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before going to the bathroom:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes, which is \( 2 \times 60 + 40 = 160 \) minutes.
   - Total time awake before going to the bathroom: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time difference is \( 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the time Kim was actually asleep:**
   - Total time Kim was awake before going to the bathroom: 220 minutes.
   - Time Kim was sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time Kim was not asleep: \( 220 + 23 = 243 \) minutes.
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Time Kim slept on her bed: \( 480 - 243 = 237 \) minutes.

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{237}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This includes both the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial number of occupied beds in the hospital. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and is currently occupied by \( \frac{1}{5} \) of its capacity.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of new patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total new patients in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

These new patients will occupy the unoccupied beds. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks will be:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 800 - 700 = 100
\]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, we determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we calculate the number of emails that are sent to family. Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the number of emails that are not work or family emails is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that this number was 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the following relationship to find the correct number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number of attendees. This can be expressed as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have picked up and carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey). Therefore, \( J = 1 \).

Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls equation, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes on the island at the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \]

Next, we need to find out how many holes were on the island at the end of the third day. Since they filled in 2 holes, the number of holes at the end of the third day is:
\[ 29 - 2 = 27 \]

According to the problem, the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 27 = 13 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To determine the total number of corn chips, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, we can express \( C \) as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:

\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we calculate the net southerly distance by subtracting the northerly distance from the southerly distance:

- Total southerly distance: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total northerly distance: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

Net southerly distance:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at different points during the day.

1. **Initial batch made by Greta:**
   - Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - \(1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}\).

2. **Brownies received from the office party:**
   - She received \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} \).
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}\).

3. **Brownies received from the surprise party:**
   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies.
   - \(4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}\).

Next, we sum up all the brownies Greta had:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from surprise party)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

4. **Brownies eaten during the surprise party:**
   - \(1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}\).

Finally, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Thus, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, we calculate the brother's age as follows:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. This means her age is 75% of Nani's age (since 100% - 25% = 75%). We calculate her age as follows:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of stringing and then sum these times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is full price, which is $600 each. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price. The half price of each phone is:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost for the remaining two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of the first two phones and the remaining two phones gives:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"First, we determine the number of players on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, the total number of wood slats required is:

\[ \text{Total number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and possibly sold. She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of these boxes for herself:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

So, the number of boxes she sold is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has saved from the total cost of the books:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount of money he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford the books."
"First, let's determine how many cherries Richard has. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Since Robert has 30 cherries, we can find the number of cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from 30:

\[ \text{Cherries Richard has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries shared by Richard, Jerry, and Robert is 60. We can find out how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 60 - (\text{Cherries Richard has} + \text{Cherries Robert has}) = 60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We do this by subtracting the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cherries Robert has} - \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each type of baked good on both Saturday and Sunday, and then find the total earnings.

First, let's find out how many boxes of each item Sunny sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday as \( G_{\text{Sun}} \) and the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday as \( A_{\text{Sun}} \).

From the information given:
\[ G_{\text{Sun}} = 10 + 5 = 15 \]
\[ A_{\text{Sun}} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of boxes sold on Saturday:
\[ G_{\text{Sat}} = 10 \]
\[ A_{\text{Sat}} = A_{\text{Sun}} - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: \( 10 \) boxes \(\times\) $6 = $60
- Apple pie: \( 11 \) boxes \(\times\) $15 = $165
- Total for Saturday: \( 60 + 165 = 225 \)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: \( 15 \) boxes \(\times\) $6 = $90
- Apple pie: \( 15 \) boxes \(\times\) $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: \( 90 + 225 = 315 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both days to find the total earnings:
\[ 225 + 315 = 540 \]

Thus, the total amount Sunny earned over the two days is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use:
- Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
- Over 8 days, the total number of hours she will be outside is \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours}\).
- Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is \(32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Next, we determine how many bottles are required:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.
- The number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

Thus, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The price of the blue car is $100.

Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we calculate 40% of $100:
\[ 40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the price of the red car is $60.

The total cost of both cars is:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

**Final Answer: 160**"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother, and then find the sum of these ages.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\).

3. **Solve for \(D\):**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \(B + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = 2(B + 5)\).

5. **Solve for \(B\):**
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\[20 + 30 + 40 = 90\]

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's determine how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class of 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This means the number of students who are not football players is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members. These 3 groups of students (football players, cheerleaders, and band members) will need to leave early. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the spacing are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant, including the space between it and the next plant, takes up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet. To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by 7:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Thus, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket.

For each basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all the baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. After using 27 pounds, the remaining soil is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside each month for fancy shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money she can spend on shoes each month. Since she sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes, and each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we need to determine how many pairs she can buy each month.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, we need to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we divide 12 by 2.

\[ \text{Number of pairs per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing them.

1. **Peeling the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing the Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many batches of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/batch}} = 3 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Since each batch takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ batches} \times 10 \text{ minutes/batch} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of the room.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Subsequent Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Change in Temperature:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net change in temperature: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature of the room is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw Comet Halley for the first time. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - The time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of electric bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

2. **Gas bill checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of gas bill checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

3. **Church checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of church checks per year is:
     \[
     2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

4. **Pest and lawn service checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of pest and lawn service checks per year is:
     \[
     1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
     \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl is:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's determine how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Adam's father gave him $12. Now, we add the amounts given by his mother and father to find the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to cover the cost after receiving the money from his parents. We subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can substitute the known ages of Akbar and Alessandro into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we need to use the information about Helene's age being twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]
So, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"First, let's determine the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x. \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \). Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{each adult's slice}}{\text{total size of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\%. \]

So, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for the rounds is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 180 minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on his appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes, so the total time for the appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]
Converting 300 minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on the inpatient rounds and the appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones is spending a total of 9 hours at the clinic. Therefore, the time left for updating his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to calculate the total time required for all the steps and then work backwards from the desired completion time.

1. **Cooling time**: 2 hours
2. **Frosting time**: 10 minutes
3. **Baking time**: 30 minutes
4. **Making the cake batter time**: 20 minutes

First, let's add up all the times:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes

Total time required:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to subtract this total time from the desired completion time of 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:

"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."

   - So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars per box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.
   - Therefore, \( 7y = 56 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars per box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:**
   - The difference is \( x - y \).
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     x - y = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Thus, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of male porcupines:**
   The number of male porcupines is the total population minus the number of female porcupines.
   \[
   \text{Number of male porcupines} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of porcupine babies born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupine babies born in a year:**
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Number of babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   The total number of porcupines after a year is the initial population plus the number of babies born in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, we calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, we multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we need to calculate the number of each type of stick and then sum them up.

1. **Red Sticks:**
   The number of red sticks is given as 9.

2. **Blue Sticks:**
   The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
   \]

3. **Yellow Sticks:**
   The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
   \]

4. **Total Number of Sticks:**
   To find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
   \[
   \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
   \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"First, we calculate the distance traveled by Matteo. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo, the speed is 55 miles per hour and the time is 4 hours. So, the distance traveled by Matteo is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by Shandy. For Shandy, the speed is 45 miles per hour and the time is 10 hours. So, the distance traveled by Shandy is:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the number of miles farther that Shandy drove than Matteo is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of students who are over 16 years old and the number of students who are under 16 years old.

The total number of students is 3000. Half of these students are over 16 years old:
\[
\frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]
So, there are 1500 students over 16 years old. The other half of the students are under 16 years old:
\[
\frac{3000}{2} = 1500
\]
So, there are 1500 students under 16 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many of the students over 16 years old are male. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male:
\[
\frac{1500}{4} = 375
\]
So, there are 375 male students over 16 years old. The number of female students over 16 years old is:
\[
1500 - 375 = 1125
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the students under 16 years old are male. One-half of the students under 16 years old are male:
\[
\frac{1500}{2} = 750
\]
So, there are 750 male students under 16 years old. The number of female students under 16 years old is:
\[
1500 - 750 = 750
\]

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old and the number of female students under 16 years old:
\[
1125 + 750 = 1875
\]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

Therefore, Bethany can run \(\boxed{5}\) more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

First, we calculate the charge remaining after 5 hours, during which the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour. The charge remaining after each hour can be calculated as follows:

After 1 hour: \( x \times (1 - 0.09) = x \times 0.91 \)
After 2 hours: \( x \times 0.91^2 \)
After 3 hours: \( x \times 0.91^3 \)
After 4 hours: \( x \times 0.91^4 \)
After 5 hours: \( x \times 0.91^5 \)

So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times 0.91^5 \).

Next, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. The charge remaining after these 3 hours can be calculated as follows:

After 6 hours: \( x \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07) = x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93 \)
After 7 hours: \( x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^2 \)
After 8 hours: \( x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \)

So, after 8 hours, the charge remaining is \( x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \).

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

First, we calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):

\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ x \times 0.624 \times 0.804 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501} \approx 0.559 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 56\% \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}

"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we need to determine the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is calculated as follows:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many pieces of sweets Anne gave to her friends, we subtract the number of pieces she kept from the total number of pieces:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of sweets each of her friends received is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Next, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
\[ 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain only selfies and 2 of the albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[
\text{Time for 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

\[ 3000 - 1000 = 2000 \]

Next, Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining $2000. To find the monthly payment, we calculate 10% of $2000:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay \(\boxed{200}\) dollars per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
So, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, let's determine the number of yellow balloons that Sally released. She initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \]
So, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Now, let's consider the blue balloons. Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
So, the number of blue balloons she added is 6. Therefore, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, green, and yellow balloons plus the added blue balloons:
\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% = 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% = 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (since 100% - 40% = 60%) = 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[
0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92
\]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[
100\% - 92\% = 8\%
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to find the number of small jelly beans he can consume.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Since it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small jelly beans equivalent to the medium-sized jelly beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours are:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so her total earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so her total parking expenses are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we find her net earnings after subtracting the parking expenses from her total earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her pay per hour after expenses. She worked a total of 18 hours, so her pay per hour is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books. Ted buys 3 books for $16 each, so the cost of the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pencils. Ted buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so the cost of the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between the bottles is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \) intervals.
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the time to drop the candy in each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \).

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"First, we need to determine the total number of apples Uncle Franky has. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, we add the costs of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money:
\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out during his 4 years of college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year, the total loan amount is:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earns $25,000 per year. After college, his income triples, so his new annual income is:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

During the 4 years of college, Jim is not earning any income, so the total income lost from not working is:
\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

Now, we need to find the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off his loans and the money he lost from not working. This total is:
\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

After college, Jim earns $75,000 per year. To find out how many years it will take him to earn $300,000, we divide the total amount by his annual income:
\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

Therefore, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this amount:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   Now, we sum the deliveries from all three days:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736
   \]

The total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."
"To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then sum these costs.

- Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50
\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad: $6
\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 65 + 36 = 101
\]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is:
\[
\boxed{101}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

4. **Total Loss:**
   - Total loss is the sum of the losses in all three races.
   - Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)

5. **Average Loss:**
   - To find the average loss, divide the total loss by the number of races.
   - Average loss: \( \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17 \)

Therefore, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{7.17}\)."
"To determine the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26
2. **Number of cities in each country**: 5
3. **Population of each city**: 1000 people

First, calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[
26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities}
\]

Next, calculate the total population of all these cities:
\[
130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people}
\]

Thus, the total population of South America, assuming all people live in these cities, is:
\[
\boxed{130000}

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now is 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now is 51 inches.
   - The difference is \(52 - 51 = 1\) inch.

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \) dollars.
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount of money is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.25}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x = 6 \) balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 2010 - 2007 = 3.

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

Now, we need to find the number of books written in Spanish. We do this by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of Spanish books is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, the total distance driven so far is:

\[ 325 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive. The total distance from San Diego to New York City is 1955 kilometers. Therefore, the remaining distance is:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 1300 \text{ km} = 655 \text{ km} \]

So, the number of kilometers Bernice still needs to drive is:

\[ \boxed{655} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's start by determining the number of people on the train after each stop.

Initially, Romeo boards a train with 120 people.

**First Stop:**
- 20 more people board the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(120 + 20 = 140\).

**Second Stop:**
- 50 people descend from the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(140 - 50 = 90\).
- Twice the number of people who descended (which is 50) board the train.
- Number of people boarding: \(2 \times 50 = 100\).
- Number of people on the train: \(90 + 100 = 190\).

**Third Stop:**
- 80 more people descend from the train.
- Number of people on the train: \(190 - 80 = 110\).

Thus, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: The cost is $10.
2. **Running shorts**: The cost is $5 more than the tank top, so:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Tennis shoes**: The original price is $48, but they are on sale for half price, so:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Athletic socks**: The original price is $8, but Alison has a $2 off coupon, so:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]"
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the increased cost of the insurance after the accident. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. Since the cost increased by 60%, we calculate the increase as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:

\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we need to find out how much James pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year. 

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Each twin bed requires 2 sheets, and each king size bed requires 4 sheets. Therefore, the weekly usage is:
- Twin sheets: \(4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ sheets/bed} = 8 \text{ sheets}\)
- King sheets: \(1 \text{ bed} \times 4 \text{ sheets/bed} = 4 \text{ sheets}\)

So, the total number of sheets used per week is:
\[8 \text{ (twin)} + 4 \text{ (king)} = 12 \text{ sheets/week}\]

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of sheets used in a year is:
\[12 \text{ sheets/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 624 \text{ sheets/year}\]

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs to do. The laundry machine can handle:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

Each twin set consists of 2 sheets, and each king set consists of 4 sheets. Therefore, each load can handle:
- 2 twin sets: \(2 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ sheets/set} = 4 \text{ sheets}\)
- 1 king set: \(1 \text{ set} \times 4 \text{ sheets/set} = 4 \text{ sheets}\)

So, each load can handle a total of:
\[4 \text{ (twin)} + 4 \text{ (king)} = 8 \text{ sheets/load}\]

To find the total number of loads needed, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per load:
\[\frac{624 \text{ sheets}}{8 \text{ sheets/load}} = 78 \text{ loads}\]

Thus, the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:

"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:**
   They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) is:
   \[
   4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

Thus, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection, we need to calculate the number of stickers he added each year and then sum them up.

1. **Two years ago**: Leo had 100 stickers.
2. **Last year**: Leo collected 50 stickers. Therefore, the total number of stickers he had at the end of last year is:
   \[
   100 + 50 = 150
   \]
3. **This year**: Leo collected twice the number of stickers as last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of stickers he has now is:
   \[
   150 + 100 = 250
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{250}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza:**
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas.
   \[
   4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Becky's Slices:**
   Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Jake's Slices:**
   Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, Jake ate:
   \[
   10 \text{ slices} - 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices}

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took \(\boxed{58}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill for 30 pills, so the total cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The cost is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, so the total cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \(\boxed{482}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, this means 80% of the emails do require a response.

The number of emails that require a response each day is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

Next, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then sum these numbers.

1. Calculate the total score for the first 3 tests:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Add the score of the 4th test:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out. Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Therefore, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the cost of the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"First, let's determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. According to the problem, Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. This can be calculated as follows:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

So, Sidney initially ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches. Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in these 7 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 \times 4 = 28 \]

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. Therefore, the number of sub sandwiches remaining after Mark ate 4 is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. So, the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Since each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[
\boxed{24}

"First, we need to determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost of purchasing 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is half of $4.00, which is $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   - Since 1.5 pounds of butter costs $6.00, we need to find out how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds.
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]
   - The cost for 4 sets is:
     \[
     4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"First, let's determine the total number of guests invited to Kayla's party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. Adding these together gives:

\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests attending the party is:

\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests, plus $6 for each additional guest. Since 41 guests are attending, the number of additional guests is:

\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:

\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding this to the base rental fee, the total cost of the party is:

\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

So, the total cost of the party is:

\[
\boxed{251}

"First, let's determine how much money Maggie spent and how much she has left.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money. Since she originally had $60, the amount she spent is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
\]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[
60 - 15 = 45
\]

Next, let's determine how much money Riza spent and how much she has left.

Riza spent one-third of her money. Since she originally had $60, the amount she spent is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left to find the total amount of money they have left together:
\[
45 + 40 = 85

"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[ 10 + 14 + x \]

Since this total is the same every day, the weekly consumption for all three monkeys is:
\[ 7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315 \]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[ 7 \times (24 + x) = 315 \]
\[ 24 + x = \frac{315}{7} \]
\[ 24 + x = 45 \]
\[ x = 45 - 24 \]
\[ x = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change. 

Thus, the number of quarters she leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake is priced at $5.50.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = \( 6 \times 5.50 \).

\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33
\]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is priced at $11.
   - Revenue from burger platters = \( 9 \times 11 \).

\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is priced at $1.50.
   - Revenue from sodas = \( 20 \times 1.50 \).

\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30
\]

4. **Sum the revenues from all items:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas.

"Let's break down the timeline of the trains' arrivals and departures step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 20 minutes after it arrives, which is 30 minutes after it first arrived (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train departs, which is 50 minutes after the first train arrived.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4).
   - Departs 5 minutes after it arrives, which is 55 minutes after the first train arrived.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train departs, which is 115 minutes after the first train arrived.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 115 minutes after the first train arrived.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs, which is 135 minutes after the first train arrived.
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the time the first train is scheduled to arrive, which is 10 minutes from now. The fourth train arrives 135 minutes after the first train arrived. Since Paul arrives 10 minutes after the first train is scheduled to arrive, he will wait 125 minutes (135 - 10) for his train.

The total time Paul will wait for his train is 125 minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to collect to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number of toothpicks required:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save toothpicks at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one second.
2. Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in one hour.
3. Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours.
4. Determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours.

Step 1: Since every second a new jellyfish is created by one spring, in one second, one spring creates 1 jellyfish.

Step 2: There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in one hour. Therefore, in one hour, one spring creates \(3600\) jellyfish.

Step 3: In 4 hours, one spring creates \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.

Step 4: Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance James walked:**
   - James walked halfway to the store and then walked back home.
   - The distance from his home to the store is 4 miles.
   - Halfway to the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance James walked is \( 2 \) miles (to the halfway point) + \( 2 \) miles (back home) = \( 4 \) miles.

2. **Determine the time it took James to walk the total distance:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - The time taken to walk a distance is given by the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

Thus, the total time it took James to reach the store is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Since each banana costs $0.80, the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost for 10 bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"First, we need to determine the growth rate of the crocodile per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. Therefore, the annual growth rate is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this annual growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."

   \text{Price of one BMX bike} = \frac{500}{2} = \$250
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Price of one MTB bike} = \$500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
   \]

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the number of bales produced and the number of bales picked up by the truck.

1. **Calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer makes:
     \[
     5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:
     \[
     3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales produced by the farmer:
     \[
     30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales}
     \]

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days. Therefore, the extra learning time is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{85}{3}} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step.

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the height of the first child to inches:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag:

\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \(\boxed{1080}\) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. Therefore, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, the total area to be painted is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Now, there are 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. After he takes these sodas, the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
- Unshaken sodas: \(2 - 2 = 0\)

So, there are now 2 shaken sodas left. When Ellen's friend comes along, the only sodas available are the 2 shaken ones. The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the probability of picking one of the 2 shaken sodas out of the 2 remaining sodas.

The probability is:
\[
\frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:
\[
1 \times 100 = 100\%
\]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Calculate the speed of the second train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

   For the first train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

   For the second train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.

Adding these together, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, the number of days he works is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days:
\[ 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
   \[
   \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus} = 12 \times 35 = 420
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
   \[
   \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

3. Add the number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people:
   \[
   420 + 60 = 480
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes \(\boxed{2}\) minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the total time spent on lunch and breaks each day is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:

"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan:**
   She bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
   Add this to her current balance:

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[
\frac{J}{5}
\]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15}
\]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{J}{15} = 6
\]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

   Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual Savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount needed for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since she plans to live off this amount for 20 years, the total amount needed for retirement is:
   \[
   \text{Total Retirement Savings Needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years required to save the total amount:**
   Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years it will take to save $800,000, we divide the total amount needed by her annual savings.

\]

Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[
\frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters}
\]

Therefore, the length of each final cut is \(\boxed{5}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine the total population of the school. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total height of all the heels combined.
2. Determine the total number of heels.
3. Divide the total height by the total number of heels to find the average height.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels combined:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels combined is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, let's determine the total number of heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total number of heels is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Now, we can find the average height of the heels by dividing the total height by the total number of heels:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ heels}} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."

3. Calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine how many more miles per day she needs to hike to meet her goal.

First, Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike per day if she hikes twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles per day she needs to hike to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time. Since she plans to hike 250 miles per day, the additional miles she needs to hike per day are:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"First, let's determine how many kilograms of apples Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we add the amounts that Pierre and Paul want to find out how many kilograms of apples they will take together:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, we subtract the 7 kg that Pierre and Paul want from the total to find out how many kilograms Jacques will have left:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the number of kilograms of apples that James will have left is:

   \]

4. **Amount spent on a comic book:**
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Amount spent on a puzzle:**
   \[
   19 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total amount spent:**
   \[
   5 + 19 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Amount of money left after spending:**
   \[
   32 - 24 = 8 \text{ dollars}

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchase. Therefore, the total amount spent is:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and each book cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. 

To find the number of students this year, we first calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Then, we add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can calculate the number of blinks per minute as follows:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the light \(\boxed{9}\) minutes to blink 459 times."
"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's garden pond.

**Initial counts:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Total initial male fishes:**
\[ 4 \text{ (male guppies)} + 3 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 7 \text{ male fishes} \]

**Total initial female fishes:**
\[ 7 \text{ (female guppies)} + 5 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 12 \text{ female fishes} \]

**Fishes bought:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

**New counts after purchase:**
- Male guppies: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)
- Female guppies: \( 7 + 1 = 8 \)
- Male goldfishes: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)
- Female goldfishes: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

**Total male fishes after purchase:**
\[ 6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11 \text{ male fishes} \]

**Total female fishes after purchase:**
\[ 8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16 \text{ female fishes} \]

**Difference between female and male fishes:**
\[ 16 \text{ (female fishes)} - 11 \text{ (male fishes)} = 5 \]

So, Tate has \(\boxed{5}\) more female fishes than male fishes."
"First, let's determine the time each person took to complete their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, and she took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Dior's time is \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours (since it is specified ""well over 4 hours longer,"" the minimum time is 8 hours).

Now, we sum the times for all three chores:

\[
4 \text{ hours (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ hours (Megan)} + 8 \text{ hours (Dior)} = 18 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance from John's home to his parents' place. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Distance to parents' place} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since this is a round trip, we need to double this distance:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{560} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days. Since Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate the total distance she will walk in 7 days as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times B \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers each produce 6 toys per hour. Therefore, the total production for these two workers is:
\[ 2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers each produce 4 toys per hour. Therefore, the total production for these two workers is:
\[ 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding these together, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, which means the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

Thus, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of stickers Seth originally had as \( S \).

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis used half of the stickers he received and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and gave the remaining \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9, which means he gave \( \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7 \) stickers to Rob. From this, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} - 9 = 7
   \]
4. Solving the equation for \( S \):
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 7 + 9 = 16
   \]
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

So, Seth originally had \(\boxed{64}\) stickers."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance for half the circumference of the earth:**
   The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days required for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let \(v\) be Vince's age two years ago, then we have the equation:
\[14 = 2v.\]
Solving for \(v\), we get:
\[v = \frac{14}{2} = 7.\]
This means that two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Therefore, Vince's current age is:
\[7 + 2 = 9.\]
So, Vince is now \(\boxed{9}\) years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we substitute \( C \) and \( S \) into the total number of eggs painted:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite this as:
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons. We do this by dividing 200 by 8:

\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]

So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons. Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, he will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce per crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and there are 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces per box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes gives us the total weight in ounces:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 1 pound = 16 ounces. Therefore, the total weight in pounds is:

\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces per pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's determine the length of the logs John can make from the tree. The tree is 80 feet tall, and he can make logs from 80% of it. So, the length of the logs is:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 4-foot logs he can get from 64 feet of wood. This is calculated by dividing 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. Therefore, the total number of planks he can get from 16 logs is:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2. So, the total amount of money he makes from selling all the planks is:
\[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

1. **Determine the time spent on the beach:**
   Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. This is given directly in the problem.

2. **Determine the speed on the beach:**
   Let \( v \) be the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach in miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, we can find her speed on the beach as follows:
   \[
   v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

3. **Determine the speed on the sidewalk:**
   Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

4. **Determine the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. Using her speed on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
   \[
   \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   The total time for the walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, we calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far. She has saved $4 every week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount saved is:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Jane needs to save to reach a total of $60. This can be calculated by subtracting the amount she has already saved from $60:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take her to save the additional $28. We do this by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly savings:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 3 trees that each had 7 blue birds:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

2. Calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. The number of blue birds in the 1 tree that had 3 blue birds is:
   \[
   3
   \]

4. Add the results from the three parts together to get the total number of blue birds:
   \[
   21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to find the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we need to subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The total volume of the mixture will be 5 ounces.

The formula for the weighted average temperature \( T_{\text{avg}} \) is:
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this average temperature to be at least 40 degrees:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):
\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Substitute this into the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, solve for \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then sum them with the initial number of animals.

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18
   \]
   So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. **Find out how many potatoes are needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \quad \text{(potatoes for 1 less than 3 scoops)}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \quad \text{(scoops)}
   \]
   So, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \quad \text{(potatoes per scoop)}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   Since 1.5 potatoes are needed for 1 scoop, for 18 scoops, the number of potatoes required is:
   \[
   18 \times 1.5 = 27
   \]

So, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red jellybeans. According to the problem, there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we need to find out how many jellybeans are either green or red. Adding the number of green and red jellybeans together, we get:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons from one tree in one year.
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees in one year.
Tim has 5 trees, so the total number of lemons from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade (10 years).
Since there are 10 years in a decade, the total number of lemons collected in a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of men and women on the bus initially. The ratio of men to women is given as 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

First, let's denote the number of men by \(5x\) and the number of women by \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we can write the equation:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- The number of men is \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\).
- The number of women is \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\).

Next, we need to determine how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. The number of women remaining is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day from the individual sunflowers and the bouquets.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The cost of one sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291
     \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we calculate the number of rocks as follows:

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks Adam sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
\]

Each rock is sold for $7, so the total revenue from selling the rocks is:

\[
\text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84
\]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. Therefore, the loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[
\text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of scene separately and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for large-sized scenes} = \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for medium-sized scenes} = \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

Finally, let's calculate the number of days required to draw the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.

\[
\text{Days for small-sized scenes} = \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene to find the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total days} = 9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all the picture scenes is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Chatty has four children, and she wants to distribute the eggs equally among them. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ eggs}}{4 \text{ children}} = 9 \text{ eggs per child}
\]

So, each child receives \(\boxed{9}\) eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food per day. May has 31 days.

1. Patricia initially has 30 roses.
2. She gave 24 roses to her mother. So, the number of roses left with her is:
   \[
   30 - 24 = 6
   \]
3. She then bought 15 more roses. So, the total number of roses she has now is:
   \[
   6 + 15 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the final number of roses Patricia has now is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To find the average speed, we need to determine the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is \(\boxed{50}\) miles per hour."
"To determine the probability that both of Mark's lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the probability of winning for each ticket.
2. Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners by multiplying the individual probabilities.

First, we know that the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, which can be written as 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. This is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine how many seashells Carlos collected. We know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, Carlos collected:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, Carrey collected:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we can find the total number of seashells collected by adding the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide all the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his consumption by days and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he eats 4 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on the weekend. There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), and he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine the length of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long, and the second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit per device is the selling price minus the buying price:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is the profit per device multiplied by the total number of devices:
\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find Carl's height. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex would need to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles of juice are needed (since \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \)).
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Thus, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 octuplets and 3/4 of them are dressed in purple and 1/4 in blue:

- Number of purple-wearing octuplets: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of blue-wearing octuplets: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of these octuplets are wearing bows. According to the problem, all the blue-wearing octuplets and 1/3 of the purple-wearing octuplets also wear bows:

- Number of blue-wearing octuplets wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Number of purple-wearing octuplets wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearing octuplets wearing bows is 2, and the total number of octuplets wearing bows is 4. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of tax reports received from Monday to Friday.
2. Subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday from the total.
3. Subtract the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday from the remaining total.

First, we know the total number of tax reports received last week is 5168.

Next, we know the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

Then, we know the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

Now, we can calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports.

The calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of reports:

\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is \(\boxed{1125}\)."
"First, let's determine how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction. He sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Therefore, the amount of land sold in the first transaction is:
\[
\frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much land he has left after the first sale:
\[
80 - 40 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]

After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. The amount of land sold in the second transaction is:
\[
\frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters}
\]

Now, we calculate the remaining land after the second sale:
\[
40 - 10 = 30 \text{ square meters}
\]

Abraham then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The money earned from selling the remaining land is:
\[
30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add up all the money earned from the three transactions:
\[
50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{170}

"To determine Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day. Since he changes his face mask two times each time he goes out, the number of face masks used per day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   Since he uses 6 face masks per day, the number of face masks used in 2 days is:
   \[
   6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}
   \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs each person finds:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we sum the number of eggs found by all four people:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments in all three complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree over its first 10 years of life.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let the number of fruits produced by a 10-year-old tree be \( x \).
   - Therefore, the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old tree is \( x - 200 \).

5. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).

6. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Does not produce any fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

8. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:

\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{2350}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her money. We calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100 as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 that Sophia gave him, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jack has now is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R_b \) be the length of the blue rope in centimeters.
- Let \( R_r \) be the length of the red rope in centimeters.
- Let \( R_y \) be the length of the yellow rope in centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
   \[
   R_r = 4R_b
   \]
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
   \[
   R_b = R_y - 7
   \]
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
   \[
   R_r + R_b + R_y = 37
   \]

First, substitute \( R_r \) and \( R_y \) in terms of \( R_b \) into the combined length equation:
\[
4R_b + R_b + (R_b + 7) = 37
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4R_b + R_b + R_b + 7 = 37
\]
\[
6R_b + 7 = 37
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
6R_b = 30
\]

Divide by 6:
\[
R_b = 5
\]

Now, find \( R_r \) and \( R_y \):
\[
R_r = 4R_b = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]
\[
R_y = R_b + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the length of the red rope is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]
According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \), we subtract 12 from 15:
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so he is left with:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half of the mural is yellow, we can determine the amount of yellow paint used first. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:

\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

This leaves the other half of the mural to be painted with red, white, and purple paint. Since the remaining half is also 6 pints, and the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each of these paints as \(x\). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + x + x = 6
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of puffs each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 12 \times 2 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 24 \times 2 = 48
   \]

Next, we sum the number of puffs counted each day:
\[
\text{Total} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since the cost per pod is $0.10, the number of pods you can get for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then with $1, you can run:

\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final number of 5 dollar bills Thomas has is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \( 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \) inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage:**
   - The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Daily usage: \( 20\% \) of the remaining chalk.

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk each day:**
   - Let \( C_n \) be the remaining chalk after \( n \) days.
   - After the first day (Tuesday), the remaining chalk is:
     \[
     C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the second day (Wednesday), the remaining chalk is:
     \[
     C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the third day (Thursday), the remaining chalk is:
     \[
     C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fourth day (Friday), the remaining chalk is:
     \[
     C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After the fifth day (Saturday), the remaining chalk is:
     \[
     C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Determine when the chalk needs to be recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - After the fifth day, the remaining chalk is 0.90112 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{5}\) days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk."
"First, let's determine the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys}
\]

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students}

1. Calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought: \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
2. Add 2 to that number: \(15 + 2 = 17\).

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The final numerical answer is:
17"
"First, let's determine the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:

\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of teeth fixed by adding the number of teeth drilled and the number of teeth capped:

\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, we need to find what percentage of James' 30 teeth this represents. We use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the 4000 gallons of milk he purchased.

The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5. Therefore, the refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

The calculation for the total number of books he can buy is:
\[
\frac{27000}{500} \times 100 = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among the 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:
\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school}
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up these two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up the one apple he threw at the tree.
   - Newton picked up the 4 apples he put in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 6 apples.
   - Newton put all but one of these 6 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

4. **Third Action:**
   - Newton picked up the one apple he threw at the tree.
   - Newton picked up the 5 apples he put in his pocket.
   - Newton went home with the remaining 1 apple from the 6 he picked up.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- From the initial two apples: 2 apples.
- From the first action: 1 apple (left in his pocket) + 4 apples (picked up) = 5 apples.
- From the second action: 1 apple (left in his pocket) + 5 apples (picked up) = 6 apples.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 \]

Thus, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Therefore, the net rate of snowball production is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs at this net rate. We can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Time (hours)} \times 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for the time:
\[ \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine John's age 20 years ago.
2. Use the information that John was twice as old as Jim 20 years ago to find Jim's age at that time.
3. Calculate Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age 20 years ago.

First, we know that John is currently 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John was:
\[ 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim. Let \( J \) be Jim's age 20 years ago. Then:
\[ 8 = 2J \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago. Therefore, Jim's current age is:
\[ 4 + 20 = 24 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

So, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."

1. **Determine the number of bandages used on the second day:**
   - On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages used on the second day is \(38 - 10 = 28\).

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used in the first two days:**
   - The total number of bandages used in the first two days is \(38 + 28 = 66\).

3. **Determine the number of bandages ordered and used on the third day:**
   - On the third day, the nurses ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(0.5 \times 50 = 25\) bandages.
   - Therefore, the net increase in bandages on the third day is \(100 - 25 = 75\) bandages.

4. **Calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days:**
   - The total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days is \(66 + 75 = 141\).

"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and 6 days a week. Therefore, her weekly working hours are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/hour} = 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10 for complete attendance each week. Therefore, her total additional earnings for the month are:
\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 10 \, \text{\$/week} = 40 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we add her weekly earnings from her hourly rate to her additional earnings for the month:
\[ 67.5 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} + 40 \, \text{\$} = 270 \, \text{\$} + 40 \, \text{\$} = 310 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first in the morning, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:
\[50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (at 10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320\]

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[
\frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:
\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[
60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:
\[
20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted on the second day:
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day is:
\[30 + 50 = 80\]

Now, we add the number of trees planted on both days to find the total number of trees planted:
\[60 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. His friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is to be shared equally among these 3 people. Therefore, the amount of root beer each person gets is:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of fish that have red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, there are 22 fish with red stripes. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Therefore, there are 20 fish with blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also had three makeup sets with six colors each.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total number of colors Amy originally had.
     \[
     8 \text{ colors} + 18 \text{ colors} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Account for the colors stolen by her sister:**
   - Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Account for the colors Amy uses up:**
   - Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Subtract the used colors from the remaining total.
     \[
     22 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors} = 19 \text{ colors}
     \]

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the height of the second floor. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height of the second floor is the total height minus the height of the first floor:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many shells team Alphas found. Since team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, we calculate:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. Next, we need to find out how many shells were left for the other two teams after team Alphas found their shells. We subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total number of shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, we need to determine how many shells team The finders found. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

This means team The finders found 252 shells. To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total amount of exercise needed for all four dogs combined. We know that on average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day. Since there are 4 dogs, the total amount of exercise needed per day is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the exercise requirements for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

We add these amounts together to find the total exercise needed for the first three dogs:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total exercise needed for the first three dogs from the overall total exercise needed:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by finding 40% of the value of his house.

The value of the house is $250,000. So, the loan amount is:
\[ 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of this loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. So, the amount used to pay off debts is:
\[ 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:
\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To determine how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines at $72. So, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To perform the multiplication, we can simplify it as follows:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's determine the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting per day:

- The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.
- The medium setting removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
- The high setting removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Next, we calculate the total amount of water removed for each period:

- For the 3 days on the low setting: \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}\).
- For the 3 days on the medium setting: \(3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}\).
- For the 5 days on the high setting: \(5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Finally, we sum the amounts of water removed from each period to find the total amount of water removed:

\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of each class in both schools.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's classes each have a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the capacities of both schools to find the combined capacity:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of these diaper changes. Therefore, the number of diaper changes she handles is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since the total number of changes is 10 and Jordan's wife handles 5 of them, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles is:

\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864

   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 20
   \]

2. **Number of people entering the bus at the first stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at first stop} = 40
   \]

3. **Total number of people on the bus after the first stop:**
   \[
   \text{Total after first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Number of people entering the bus at the second stop:**
   \[
   \text{People entering at second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]

5. **Total number of people on the bus after the second stop:**

"First, let's determine the cost of one visit to the museum after the increase. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. After a 150% increase, the new cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + 2 \times 1.5 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of visits Pauline made in the first 5 years. Since she visits the museum three times a year, the total number of visits in 5 years is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

The cost for these 15 visits is:

\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5. The total number of visits in these 3 years is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

The cost for these 9 visits is:

\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \]

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is \( 4x \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \). According to the problem, the number of brownies she makes is \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

Now, let's calculate the total number of issues from each type of magazine:

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Next, we sum the total number of issues from all the magazines:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the total number of issues. We need to count the number of magazines:

- 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year
- 1 magazine that sends 24 issues a year

So, the total number of magazines is:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \]

   \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Therefore, we can express the number of paintings Kim has as:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Thus, the number of paintings Kim has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy in December after an 80% increase from its November price of $40.

The increase in price is calculated as:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. The decrease in price is calculated as:
\[ 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]

So, the price of the toy after the discount in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate.

The standard rate is $80 per hour. Therefore, for 4 lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, let's determine the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, so the reduced rate is:
\[ 100\% - 25\% = 75\% \]
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Charlie gives 2 lessons at this reduced rate, so the total earnings from these lessons are:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum all the scores**: Add up all the scores Sally received.
2. **Count the number of scores**: Determine how many scores there are.
3. **Divide the total sum by the number of scores**: This will give us the mean score.

Let's start with the first step:

The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Sum of the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
\[ 130 + 80 = 210 \]
\[ 210 + 60 = 270 \]
\[ 270 + 40 = 310 \]
\[ 310 + 90 = 400 \]
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \]
\[ 500 + 70 = 570 \]
\[ 570 + 60 = 630 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of scores to find the mean:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had. 

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number of pomelos:
\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away \(\boxed{15}\) pomelos."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 of them:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. First, we find 25% of 36:
\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

Subtract the 9 apples given to his sister from the remaining 36 apples:
\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:
\[
27 \times 3 = 81
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{81}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of novels Regina wrote this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of novels Regina wrote last year (which is 9) is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. First, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 9 \times 4 = 3x \]
\[ 36 = 3x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the number of novels Regina has written this year is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr, and he travels for 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total distance he travels is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance between Alaska and Texas}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"First, let's determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, let's denote the total number of grapes as \( G \). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the remaining grapes were all used for the pies, we can set up the following equation:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

To find the total number of grapes \( G \), we solve the equation:

\[ G = 48 + 36 = 84 \]

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School on Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of teachers at the school.
2. Subtract the number of teachers who were sick.
3. Add the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. The total number of teachers at the school is 82.
2. The number of teachers who were sick is 13. So, the number of teachers who were not sick is:
   \[
   82 - 13 = 69
   \]
3. The number of substitute teachers called in is 9. So, the total number of teachers at school that day is:
   \[
   69 + 9 = 78
   \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is \(\boxed{78}\)."
"First, let's calculate the weekly cost of making macaroni and cheese for Bud.

1. **Cost of pasta:**
   Bud spends $1.00 on a box of pasta each week.

2. **Cost of cheddar cheese:**
   Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.

3. **Cost of gruyere cheese:**
   Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese. Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese is:
   \[
   2 \times 3.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total weekly cost:**
   Adding up all the costs, the total amount Bud spends each week is:
   \[
   1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual cost:**
   Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost for one year (52 weeks) is:
   \[
   10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many minutes the custodian works in 5 days. Since they work an 8-hour day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the number of minutes worked per day is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total number of minutes worked is:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out what percentage of their total working time is spent cleaning the classrooms. The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated as follows:

\[ \left( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{2400 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Next, we calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has 3 shelves (one top, one middle, and one bottom), the total capacity is:
\[10 + 20 + 15 = 45 \text{ books}\]

Now, we need to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[110 \div 45 \approx 2.4444\]

Since Elly cannot use a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs 3 bookcases to hold all 110 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost is $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine the selling price of the eggs. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. To find out how many eggs she has in total, we calculate:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ eggs}}{3 \text{ eggs per set}} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she sells each set for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \text{ sets} \times \$1 \text{ per set} = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of red hats Skyler has. Since half of the 100 hats are red, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red hats:

\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
\]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:

\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

The rest of the hats are white. To find the number of white hats, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

\[
\text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price of one bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. Since one bag contains 30 sticks, we divide the price of the bag by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

The cost per stick in dollars is $0.50. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to answer 77 questions correctly to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to determine how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she already answered correctly from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."
"To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of games Ara plays each year.
2. Calculate the total number of games she has played over the four years.
3. Multiply the total number of games by her average score per game to find the total points scored.

Step 1: Number of games per year
Ara plays 40 games every year.

Step 2: Total number of games over four years
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Step 3: Total points scored
Ara scores 21 points per game. Therefore, the total points scored over 160 games is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

The total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \(\boxed{3360}\)."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he dropped \(10 \div 2 = 5\) marbles. This left him with \(10 - 5 = 5\) marbles. Then, he found 3 more marbles, so he had \(5 + 3 = 8\) marbles. However, he found that one of the marbles was actually a bead and discarded it. Therefore, he ended up with \(8 - 1 = 7\) marbles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps based on the given ratios.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 customers that come into the dealership, 1 buys a car.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 30 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - Therefore, to get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make \(\boxed{750}\) telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus."
"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Count the flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights, so there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Count the candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So, there are \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms with small candles, and each of these rooms has 4 small candles, making a total of \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, there are \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms with medium candles, and each of these rooms has 5 medium candles, making a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Combine the flashlights and candles:**
   - The total number of flashlights and candles is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

\[ \frac{110}{5} = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips."
"To determine the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to calculate the time taken for each side and then sum these times.

1. **First side:**
   - Time taken: 5 minutes

2. **Second side:**
   - Time taken: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes

3. **Third side:**
   - Time taken: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes

4. **Fourth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

5. **Fifth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

6. **Sixth side:**
   - Time taken: \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all six sides:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5
\]

First, add the times for the first three sides:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, add the times for the last three sides:

\[
2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 7.5 \text{ minutes}

"Given that there are 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Since there are 20 helmets:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70

"First, let's determine how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of days in the work week:

\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:

\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in drying time between the new and old varnish:

\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup each:**
   \[
   4 \text{ plants} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup each:**
   \[
   8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup each:**
   \[

"To determine how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the land part and the water part.

1. **Total Distance:**
   The total distance Phineas needs to travel to return home is 200 yards.

2. **Distance on Land and in Water:**
   Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Distance on land} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance in water} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Time to Travel on Land:**
   Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards on land is:
   \[
   \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Time to Travel in Water:**
   Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute. The time to travel 100 yards in water is:
   \[
   \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Total Time:**
   The total time to return home is the sum of the time on land and the time in water:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}

"First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks required by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the 4 additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the 4 additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made daily:**

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes is given by:

\[ t = \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

Perform the division:

\[ t = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat.

1. **Initial Popping Rate:**
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

2. **Second 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels pop.

3. **Third 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels pop.

4. **Fourth 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is half of the third 30 seconds.
   - \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.

5. **Final 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is the same as the fourth 30 seconds.
   - \( 40 \) kernels pop.

6. **Residual Heat Popping:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat.
   - \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) additional kernels pop.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade and then convert that into the number of lemons.

First, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the pool party:
- Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

Next, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- Since the extra gallon is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.
- Therefore, the extra gallon will require \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

Now, let's find the total amount of lemon juice needed:
- The total lemon juice required is \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups.

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 6 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the kennel house's dogs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
  \[
  3 \text{ German Shepherds} \times 5 \text{ kg/day} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Next, calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ Bulldogs} \times 3 \text{ kg/day} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
  \]

Now, add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to find the total daily consumption:
\[
15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
\]

Finally, calculate the total weekly consumption by multiplying the total daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals.
2. Calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals.
3. Add the two totals together to get the overall number of legs.
4. Divide the total number of legs by 2 to find the number of pairs of legs.

Let's start with the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the legs from the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\).

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals:
- The total number of legs is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

Finally, we find the number of pairs of legs by dividing the total number of legs by 2:

"Let's denote the number of red blocks as \( R \).

According to the problem, the tower is made out of:
- 4 blue blocks,
- twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) yellow blocks,
- and an unknown number of red blocks, \( R \).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

   The initial value of the boat is $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the first year} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after the first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the second year} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after the second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation in the third year} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882

Now, we add the weekly meditation and yoga times to find the total time spent on both activities each week:

\[ 210 \text{ minutes/week} + 300 \text{ minutes/week} = 510 \text{ minutes/week} \]

To find the total time spent over 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

\[ 510 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 2040 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is:

\[ 2040 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To determine the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the contribution of each size of t-shirt and then sum these contributions.

First, we calculate the total square footage from the small t-shirts:
\[
11 \text{ small t-shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet per small t-shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the total square footage from the medium t-shirts:
\[
8 \text{ medium t-shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet per medium t-shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet}
\]

Then, we calculate the total square footage from the large t-shirts:
\[
6 \text{ large t-shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet per large t-shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet}
\]

Finally, we sum the square footage from all the t-shirts to find the total square footage of the quilt:
\[
33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet} = 101 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the total square footage of the quilt is:
\[
\boxed{101}

"First, let's determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower. Since a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, and one dozen equals 12 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate:

\[ 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives us the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, we add the number of seeds in one small sunflower and one large sunflower to find the total number of seeds:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Thus, the number of pens Sarah has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how tall Jackie was before the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Anne's height.
2. Determine Jackie's height after the summer.
3. Calculate Jackie's height before the summer.

First, we know that Albert is 36 inches tall. According to the problem, Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, Anne's height is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's height after the summer is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of Jackie before the summer was:
\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To determine how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. The store has a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

1. The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
2. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so its cost is \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) dollars.

The total cost for the T-shirts is:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40.

The discount on the shoes is:
\[ 40 \times 0.4 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the sale price of the shoes is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores. Ryan receives $6 each week, so for 3 weeks, he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total earnings, Ryan has:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets for himself and 3 friends. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so the total cost for 4 movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Ryan only has $13, he cannot afford to buy 4 movie tickets. We need to determine how many movie tickets he can buy with his $13. We do this by dividing $13 by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.50 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"

So, Ellen's total expenses are:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate Lani's total expenses:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. Therefore, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 \times 2 = 200 \]
So, Lani's total expenses are:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's and Lani's total expenses to find the combined total:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"

- **Passion fruit cost for one jar:**
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Jackfruit cost for one jar:**
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12
  \]

- **Honey cost for one jar:**
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20
  \]

Next, we sum the costs of the ingredients for one jar:
\[
\$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
\]

Tim sells each jar for \$50. Therefore, the profit from selling one jar is:
\[
\$50 - \$44 = \$6
\]

To find the total profit from selling 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10:
\[
\$6 \times 10 = \$60
\]

Thus, the total profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum these values.

2. Movie tickets (for herself and her sister): $7.50 each, so for two people it's \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total expenditure:
\[
3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00
\]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left after her expenditures, we subtract the total amount spent from the $40:
\[
40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Janet has left is:
\[
\boxed{13}

- Oatmeal cookies: 9
- Chocolate chip cookies: 4
- Sugar cookies: 5

First, Randy ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor. This means he ate:
- 1 oatmeal cookie
- 1 chocolate chip cookie
- 1 sugar cookie

After this, the number of cookies left is:
- Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
- Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
- Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

Next, Randy ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So, the number of oatmeal cookies left is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at this net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

So, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the speed of Aaron and Vanessa. We know that Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, and Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.

Given:
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
- Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.

From this, we can calculate Aaron's speed:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \times 2 = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles. Using her speed:
\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took \(\boxed{16}\) minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night's reservations.

Each night, the restaurant gets 6 reservations. For each reservation, they order 2 meals at $5 each and 1 bottle of wine at $5.

The cost for the meals per reservation is:
\[ 2 \text{ meals} \times \$5 \text{ per meal} = \$10 \]

The cost for the wine per reservation is:
\[ 1 \text{ bottle of wine} \times \$5 \text{ per bottle} = \$5 \]

So, the total cost per reservation is:
\[ \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \]

Since there are 6 reservations each night, the total cost for one night is:
\[ 6 \text{ reservations} \times \$15 \text{ per reservation} = \$90 \]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total cost for the week is:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times \$90 \text{ per day} = \$180 \]

Therefore, the total amount the restaurant makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the selling price per watermelon is:

"First, let's determine Dora's current age. We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \]

Next, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. So, James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. We know that John had James when he was 19. Therefore, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \]

We are also given that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Therefore, the age of John's youngest son now is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \]

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years. So, we add 3 years to his current age:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, we calculate the total number of slices as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
