"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the house and repairs.
2. Calculate the increased value of the house after repairs.
3. Subtract the total cost from the increased value to find the profit.

Step 1: Total cost of the house and repairs
- Cost of the house: $80,000
- Cost of repairs: $50,000
- Total cost: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 2: Calculate the increased value of the house
- The value of the house increased by 150% after repairs.
- To find the increased value, we calculate 150% of the total cost and add it to the total cost.
- 150% of $130,000 = 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000
- Increased value of the house: $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit
- Profit = Increased value of the house - Total cost
- Profit = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000

Final numerical answer:
$195,000"
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning and afternoon, Wendi gives 15 cups and 25 cups of feed, respectively. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as \( S \), in Charleston as \( C \), and in Toulouse as \( T \).

Given that Seattle has 20 sheep, we have:
\[ S = 20 \]

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
\[ C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
\[ T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

The total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep is:
260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40% completion:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file to be downloaded:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = 0.60 * 200 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time for the return trip = 4 hours.
     - Time spent driving after the first 2 hours and the 0.5 hours = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered in the last 1.5 hours = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in the first 2 hours (standstill) = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered in the next 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered in the last 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate the earnings for each part:

- Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. So, the downloads in the third month would be:
\[ 180 - (180 \times 0.30) = 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Therefore, the program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Next, we find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:
   - 20 - 4 = 16 students

3. Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
   - 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Now, we find out how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students

5. Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final profit: $96**"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \, \text{dollars} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:

Final answer:
\[ 7 \text{ dozens} \]"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent hiking.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

First, the total time required to hike 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time already spent hiking is:
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance is:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance to hike is:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter of water.
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = 6 liters.
   - Water in the pineapple drink = 9 liters.
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine the age difference between when Raymond had his son and his current age.

Raymond's current age is 25, and he had his son at 23. So, the son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."

"Let's break down the costs:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total cost is the sum of all these items, which equals $50. So we can write the equation:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]
\[ 8.50x = 50 - 33 \]
\[ 8.50x = 17 \]
\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{\$16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means it was at mile 45 (since 60 - 15 = 45).

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between these two mile markers:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
104"
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"To calculate the total hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day, and John has 10 dogs. So, the daily care time is:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly care time is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 

First, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 13 lego sets.
2. He sells each lego set for $15.
3. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.
4. After all transactions, he has $5 left.

First, calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set} = \$195 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per game} = \$160 \]

Now, determine how much money John has after buying the video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since John has $5 left after all transactions, we can confirm that the remaining $35 - $5 = $30 was spent on something else, but the question only asks about the number of lego sets he still has.

Since John sold all his lego sets initially, he has:
\[ 0 \text{ lego sets} \]

Final numerical answer:

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days, so he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. 

Let \( R \) be her running speed. Then:
\[ \frac{R}{2} = 3 \]
\[ R = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed \( W \):
\[ R = 4W \]
\[ 6 = 4W \]
\[ W = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. 

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance she can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled while running and walking:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \text{ miles} \]"

"If Polly can throw the gold javelin for a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces available initially is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since a 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \) calories per gram.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram: \( \frac{200}{4.17} \approx 48 \) grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.
2. Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.
3. Multiply the total number of articles by the average time it takes to write one article (4 hours).

**Step 1: Determine the number of articles written each day.**

- **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7
  \]
- **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.**

\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

The equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Initial Post-it notes} - \text{Post-it notes used at work} - \text{Remaining Post-it notes} = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ 80 - 220 - 23 = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

\[ -163 = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the number of Post-it notes used at work and the remaining ones should be subtracted from the initial amount plus the package amount. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \). The equation should be:

\[ 80 + x - 220 - 23 = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 243 = 0 \]
\[ x - 163 = 0 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is 163.

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 mph. The time it takes to travel back can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes and then determine how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining weight to reach the total of 15 pounds.

1. First, calculate the weight of the 30 comic books:
   - Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
   - Therefore, 30 comic books weigh \(30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\) pounds.

2. Next, determine the remaining weight that needs to be removed:
   - The total weight to be removed is 15 pounds.
   - After removing the comic books, the remaining weight is \(15 - 7.5 = 7.5\) pounds.

3. Now, calculate how many toys need to be removed to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds:
   - Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.
   - Therefore, the number of toys needed is \(7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15\).

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Charge for the first half} = 6 \times 140 = 840 \]

Next, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year. A 10% reduction in the monthly charge means the new charge is 90% of $140:
\[ \text{New monthly charge} = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]
\[ \text{Charge for the second half} = 6 \times 126 = 756 \]

Now, we sum the charges for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching those students.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \times 5 = 25\) classes.
- She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, so that's an additional 8 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students.
- So, the total number of students in a week is \(33 \times 15 = 495\).

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching those students:

- She charges $15.00 per student.
- So, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \times 15 = 7425\).

Therefore, Judy makes $7425 in one week."

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total revenue from the brownies and the cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the revenue from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ slices} \times \$3/\text{slice} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the revenue from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4/\text{slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the revenue from the brownies and the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Calculate the total amount to be paid including interest.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
The interest rate is 2% per month.
Total interest = $750 * 2% * 3 = $750 * 0.02 * 3 = $45

Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid including interest.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $45 = $795

Step 4: Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

Therefore, Shiela will pay $265 each month for 3 months."

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days and then determine how many 110-cup bags are needed.

First, we know that for the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food for the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the amounts of dog food for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 550 cups of dog food. We do this by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we can find the difference in cost between the two options to determine the savings:

1. Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years:

1. After the first year (6th year of service):
   - New salary = Initial salary + 10% of initial salary
   - New salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New salary = $600 + $60
   - New salary = $660

2. After the second year (7th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New salary = $660 + $66
   - New salary = $726

3. After the third year (8th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New salary = $798.60

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad that the adults will eat.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 5 children will eat:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of potato salad that the 20 adults will eat:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts for the children and the adults to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 25 \text{ lbs} + 200 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Let's denote the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time before the diet change was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee's current time is 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. After his diet change, his speed improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can calculate his new time as follows:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Final answer:

"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 - 5 \) (since 5 cars did not drive through).

This can be simplified to \( x + 15 \).

Since all the cars that did not take an exit eventually drove through the jam, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 30 - 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of a single box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday would be:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he had a total of 110 cookies. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
50"

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to get the total number of roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
45"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore. We know that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this journey. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Each lesson uses the whiteboard.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, we calculate the total number of lessons in a day by multiplying the number of teachers by the number of lessons each teacher has:

4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons/day

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:

8 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings/day

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).
4. To find \( D \), we solve the equation: \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

1. Cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
   - Each board cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. Cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
   - Each board cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. Total cost of all the lumber:
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. Revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards:
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $10.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. Revenue from selling the 4x4x10 boards:
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $16.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
   - Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[ 40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. 

To find out how many sheets he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a month by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."

"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each of those days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each of those days.

There are 5 days in the week, and we already know her sleep schedule for 3 of those days. So, she slept 7 hours on each of the remaining 2 days.

Now, let's calculate the total hours she slept throughout the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

Total hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34 hours

So, Sadie slept a total of 34 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she covers:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. 

One-third of 60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

So, Jennie added 20 stamps to the pile of letters already needing stamps. 

If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and she added 20 stamps to this pile, then the number of letters that were already stamped before she added the 20 is:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many babies as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( B = 2Q \)
- \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \)

Now, we substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \)
- \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To determine the total cost of everything, we need to first identify which items are non-food and then calculate the tax on those items. The food items are milk and eggs, and the non-food items are light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.

1. Calculate the total cost of non-food items:
   - Light bulbs: $3
   - Cups: $3
   - Roach traps: $4
   Total non-food items cost: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

2. Calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
   - 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

3. Calculate the total cost of food items:
   - Milk: $2
   - Eggs: $3
   Total food items cost: $2 + $3 = $5

4. Add the tax to the non-food items cost and the food items cost to get the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of food items + Cost of non-food items + Tax on non-food items
   - Total cost = $5 + $10 + $1 = $16

The final numerical answer is:
$16"
"Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. 

The cost for bleach for one client is:
2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4

The cost for cloths for one client is:
1 pack * $5/pack = $5

The total cost for supplies for one client is:
$4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

The total cost for supplies for 8 clients is:
8 clients * $9/client = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
$92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per hectare per year = 100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year.
- John has 10 hectares.
- Therefore, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year = 400 pineapples/hectare/year * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples.

Final numerical answer:
4000 pineapples"

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:
16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the winner (Steve) and the loser (Tim) is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries were left.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries were left.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons. Now, \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries were left.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries were stolen. This means \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries were left. So, \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries were left.
5. Ants carried off the final french fry, leaving 5 behind. So, \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 48 \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives his total weekly class hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to determine the monthly consumption of bananas by each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Now, let's calculate the total for 2 months:

1. Monkeys: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\)
2. Gorillas: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\)
3. Baboons: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of bananas needed for 2 months:

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Distance for one back and forth run = 100 yards (to the end) + 100 yards (back) = 200 yards.
- Total distance Blake runs = 15 runs * 200 yards/run = 3000 yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- Distance for one back and forth run to the 40-yard line and back = 40 yards (to the 40-yard line) + 40 yards (back) = 80 yards.
- Total distance Kelly runs = 34 runs * 80 yards/run = 2720 yards.

Now, we find the difference in the distances they run:
- Difference = Distance Blake runs - Distance Kelly runs = 3000 yards - 2720 yards = 280 yards.

The winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Combined total: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

They were able to catch a total of 32 fish."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.

The price increase every two months is 20% of $20, which is:
\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, every two months, the price increases by $4.

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, the price will increase 18 times.

The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, where the price after each period is the previous price plus 20% of the original price:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]

Here, the increase rate is 20%, or 0.20, and the number of periods is 18. So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ \text{Price after 36 months} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The total cost of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
- The total cost of the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

1. The accountant charges $90.
2. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour.

First, calculate the lost income:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income:
\[ \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard is €74.
The cost of the mouse is not specified, but we can assume it is included in the computer's price.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add the costs of the screen, keyboard, CD burner, and printer:

\[ 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 407 \]

Next, we add this total to the cost of the computer:

\[ 1090 + 407 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from her budget:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the increased monthly payment for each debt.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300/month
   - 50% more: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Next, we add up the increased monthly payments for all debts:

- Total increased monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the peeling time is \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the cutting time is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \(300\) seconds is \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time to get the total prep time:
- Total time = peeling time + cutting time
- Total time = \(90\) minutes + \(5\) minutes
- Total time = \(95\) minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, let's calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters:

- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- Therefore, the total amount of straw used for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Now, we know that the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces. So, the straw used for the rabbits is 20 pieces. This means the straw used for the rats is:

\[160 - 50 - 20 = 90\] pieces.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total straw used for the rats by the amount each rat gets:

\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \] rats.

Since these 15 rats are distributed equally among 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued each month and add it to the principal amount.

The initial amount Mandy owes is $100. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.02.

After the first month, the amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 100 + 100 \times 0.02 = 100 \times 1.02 = 102 \]

After the second month, the amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 102 + 102 \times 0.02 = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04 \]

After the third month, the amount Mandy owes is:
\[ 104.04 + 104.04 \times 0.02 = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict is:

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price of each bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
2. The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. The cost of the rides is $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 different rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tickets: $20.25
- Food: $15.75
- Rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each of them paid:
$102 / 3 = $34

Each of them paid $34."

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks in the flock.
Total weekly requirement = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week.

Step 2: Divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find the daily requirement.
Daily requirement = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day.

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the number of trees he would have planted and not chopped down is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

3. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. The number of trees left after 30% die is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. These 6 flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
3. After painting, the number of pink flamingos left in the front yard is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos.
5. The number of white flamingos is the 6 that were painted and put back out, which is 6 white flamingos.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. 

First, let's list Brinley's scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71. 

If Brinley removes the 71, the scores she will be averaging are 89, 92, 100, and 86, plus the score from the sixth test, which we'll call \( x \).

The formula for the average of these four scores plus the sixth test score is:
\[ \frac{89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x}{5} = 93 \]

First, we sum the known scores:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 5:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]

Then, we subtract 367 from both sides:
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups would be \(240\) cups (since one dozen is 12).
   - Let the cost of one cup be \(x\).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(240x\).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, we can write the equation as:
     \[
     240x = 36000 - 1200
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     240x = 34800
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 240 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145
     \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes. So, we set up the inequality:
\[ 30 + 4x \geq 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the inequality:
\[ 4x \geq 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x \geq 40 \]
\[ x \geq 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after paying $165 a month for 12 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return.
2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.
3. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised to be returned to find the remaining balance.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return.
The initial amount borrowed is $2000, and she promised to return it with an additional 10%. So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.
Janeth is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total amount paid is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount promised to be returned to find the remaining balance.
The remaining balance is:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 2 * Harriet's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 3 * Harriet's age = 3 * 21 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age in 3 years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age in 3 years = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age in 3 years = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
Average age = (24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45 years

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. 

So, the number of petunias he plants is:
90 - 40 = 50 petunias

To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
90 + 50 = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

"The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 

The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as by bus, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

So, if Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car, the total travel time will be:

6 days (bus to Rochester) + 3 days (car from Rochester) = 9 days.

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he chose:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which means her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

1 hour"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for each car.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects:

Final numerical answer:
12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines Steve needs to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both himself and his girlfriend."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses 5 empty pens, he can get 1 new pen by mixing the ink.

Let's calculate how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:

- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
- After making 1 new pen, he has 24 pens left (25 - 5 + 1 = 24).
- He can use 4 more pens to make another new pen, and he will have 23 pens left (24 - 5 + 1 = 23).
- He can continue this process until he can no longer make a new pen with the remaining pens.

We can set up a loop to calculate the total number of pens:

- Initial pens: 25
- New pens made: 25 / 5 = 5 (since 25 is exactly divisible by 5)

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

2. After the meeting, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

3. The remaining students after those who went out through exit A are:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

5. The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   - The number of students who went out through exit C = 700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

Given that John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider the total number of books read by both of them.

Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, which totals 3 books. Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, which also totals 3 books.

"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day, he uses 15 minutes for a call with his boss. Over 30 days, he uses:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

He also has 300 extra minutes of calls to other people.

So, the total minutes used this month is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour and it takes 6 hours each day.
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 250 \times 6 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars}

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(30\) girls in total.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has \(20 - 15 = 5\) boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has \(20 - 12 = 8\) boys.
6. The total number of boys in the first and second classes is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
7. Since there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and 2 more cows are added to each stall, so each stall now has:

\[ 20 \text{ cows} + 2 \text{ cows} = 22 \text{ cows} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows/stall} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

So, Brady has a total of \(45.00\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before termites ate any of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds was eaten:
30% * 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it would be:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it is 5600 pounds."

"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- Therefore, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Finally, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. 

The cost of cocoa is $4.20, the cost of laundry is $9.45, and the cost of the package of pasta is $1.35. Adding these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

The final numerical answer is:

$5.00"
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:

\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

1. Calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
   - Number of tomato seed packets: 20
   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
   - Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

2. Calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
   - Number of celery seed packets: 80
   - Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
   - Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

3. Add the total costs together to find the overall amount spent:
   - Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
   - Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
   - Overall total cost: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

1. Carly had 80 cards initially.
2. \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A on them:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards with the letter A}
   \]
3. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter A:
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
   \]
4. \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards with the letter B}
   \]
5. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter B:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]
6. \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had the letter C on them:
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards with the letter C}
   \]
7. The remaining cards after removing the ones with the letter C:

"To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total time for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 30.

To explain this, let's denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( m \). According to the information given, we have:

\[ M + m = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( m + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (m + 10) = M + m + 20 \]

Since \( M + m = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ M + m + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \(4 \times 0.50 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \(5 + 2 = 7\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is 7 dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can find the number of spots on a mamba by dividing the number of spots on a cobra by 2:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots on all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length gives us the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace."
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:

"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so that's:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points for all three players are:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household.
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Assuming each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the household consumes rice twice a day.
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"To calculate Watson's earnings for the month of April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Watson's daily earnings.
2. Calculate his weekly earnings, including the bonus.
3. Determine the number of weeks in April.
4. Calculate his total earnings for the month of April.

Step 1: Watson's daily earnings
Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour.
Daily earnings = 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Step 2: Watson's weekly earnings, including the bonus
Watson works 5 days a week.
Weekly earnings without bonus = $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week
Since the company performed well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week.
Weekly earnings with bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

Step 3: Number of weeks in April
April typically has 4 weeks.

Step 4: Total earnings for the month of April
Total earnings for April = $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month."

   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. The number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (since 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds).

The final numerical answer is:

8 pounds"
"To calculate the savings, let's first determine the discount for each item and then apply it to the quantities you're buying.

1. **Discount on ice cream:**

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of business suits:**
   - 6 business suits at $100 each: \(6 \times 100 = 600\)

2. **Cost of suitcases:**
   - 3 suitcases at $50 each: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)

3. **Cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of a business suit: $100
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit: \(5 \times 100 = 500\)

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 5 people in the family.
2. Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
3. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the remaining two people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah, which means the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Current population of Chile = 120,000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Now, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. It's given that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. So, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.
4. The total number of marbles Solomon has now is the sum of the marbles he bought, the marbles already in the store, and the marbles his father gave him. This is \( 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 \) marbles.
5. Each marble weighs 2kgs. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kgs.

The total weight of marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of poles:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of wires:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

If 22 men stayed at the party, then the number of men who left is 25 - 22 = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must be women.

Therefore, the number of women who left is 7.

At the beginning, there were 15 women, so the number of women left is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many pencils are in the boxes that Jam has.

Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in boxes

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes and 24 pencils in total. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we divide the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:

24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's add the number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:

Jam's pencils: 26
Meg's pencils: 46
Total pencils: 26 + 46 = 72 pencils

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to know how many pencils each box can hold. Since we know that each of Jam's boxes holds 8 pencils, we can assume that each box can hold 8 pencils. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is:

72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

9 boxes"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the weakening effect of both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so we divide 65 by 13:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, Shannon adds 5 ice cubes.

Next, we calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so for 5 ice cubes:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, we need to account for the cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

Adding the weakening effects together:

\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Total number of employees = 100.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - Total number of employees = 100.
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Total payment for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly payment for each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.
   - Total payment for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment for all programmers:**
   - Total payment for junior programmers = $80,000.
   - Total payment for senior programmers = $144,000.
   - Total monthly payment for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To find the final value of all Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.
2. Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.

**Step 1: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.**

Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

The value of the 8 shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.**

The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year. So, the new price per share is:
\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

The value of the 8 shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + H = 60 \).
2. Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so \( H = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the number of cows:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 40 \times 2 + 20 \times 4 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

The total weight of the animals is:
50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 240 pounds

Adding the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, we get:

Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, the additional distance is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Step 2: Determine the total distance Tyson runs each day after following the coach's advice.
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in June.
June has 30 days, so the total distance Tyson runs in June is:
\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180,000 \text{ meters} \]"
"Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box B} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
\[ \text{Juice Box C} = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Juice Box C} - \text{Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The restaurant has 40 tables with 4 legs each and 50 tables with 3 legs each.

For the 4-legged tables:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

For the 3-legged tables:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Subtracting the cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in a bag, we get the number of cookies Jenny eats:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference in daily revenue.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100%
   - Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now.

**Final answer:**
10%"

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Find the total number of plant pots needed.
3. Subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots April bought.

First, we know that the school asked for 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. Therefore, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

Now, subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount:

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. John spends 6 hours boating.
2. He spends half that time swimming, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
3. He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.
4. The total time spent on these activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.
5. This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation.

Let's denote the total time spent on vacation as \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, John spent a total of 50 hours on vacation.

Now, we know that he spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in savings from the cost of the phone.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate the total amount Annabelle has after adding her savings:
   - Total amount = $80 (initial savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate how much more she needs to save:
   - Amount needed = $400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total amount) = $45

"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so first we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

Now, we multiply this combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree:
17 feet * 2 = 34 feet

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this total from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (assuming she is one of the participants):
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's assume Morgan invites \( x \) friends. The total cost for Morgan and her friends would be:
\[ 30 + 30x \]

Morgan's budget is $90, so we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 30x = 90 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 30x = 60 \]

Divide both sides by 30 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, which totals to 4 * $0.25 = $1.00 per day.

The change she saves each day is $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is $4.00 * 5 = $20.00.

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. We know he spent half of his change on gumballs, and he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.

2. Calculate the cost of 40 gumballs:
   \[
   40 \text{ gumballs} \times \$0.05 \text{ per gumball} = \$2
   \]

3. Since the $2 was half of his change, his total change after buying the candy was:
   \[
   2 \times \$2 = \$4
   \]

4. Billy started with $10, so the amount he spent on candy is:
   \[
   \$10 - \$4 = \$6
   \]

5. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
   \[
   \frac{\$6}{\$1.5 \text{ per pound}} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily mileage:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed:
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

4. Add the amounts together to get the total amount of stuffing needed:
   - Total stuffing = stuffing for chihuahua beds + stuffing for collie beds
   - Total stuffing = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, we calculate:
   \[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[ 3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50 \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[ 31 + x = 50 \]
6. Solve for \( x \):

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10}{12}\% = \frac{10}{1200} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{120} = \frac{3650}{120} = 30.4167 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 30.4167 = 3680.4167 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3680.4167}{5} = 736.0833 \]

"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade. Since each cup is sold for $1:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Millie's total cost for supplies is $18. Therefore, her profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 - 30 = $6 \]

So, David saves $6."
"To find out how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to determine the total number of gifts she has to wrap.

Adding these together, we get:
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services he is getting.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost is reduced.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The original cost for both is $10 each, so together it's $20.
- A 20% discount on $20 is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- So, the discounted cost for both is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus (discounted): $16
- Total cost of streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find out how much Tim saves:
- Cost of cable package: $60
- Total cost of streaming services: $26
- Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package."

Now, let's add up the total time spent:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Usage:**
   - Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   - Energy used per day = 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours.

2. **Reduced Usage:**
   - Mel reduces the time by 5 hours a day, so he now uses the air conditioner for 3 hours a day.
   - Energy used per day after reduction = 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

3. **Daily Savings:**
   - Daily savings in watt-hours = Initial daily usage - Reduced daily usage
   - Daily savings = 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

4. **Convert to Kilowatt-hours:**
   - 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours.
   - Daily savings in kilowatt-hours = 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh.

"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

New total cannolis = Original cannolis + Additional cannolis
New total cannolis = 40 + 60
New total cannolis = 100

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so the new number of corns is:

New number of corns = Original corns - 40
New number of corns = 80 - 40
New number of corns = 40

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Combined total = New total cannolis + New number of corns
Combined total = 100 + 40
Combined total = 140

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he had taken before his jog, we add the steps from his walks to and from school and the steps from his short walk with his friend:

5,000 (school steps) + 1,000 (friend's walk) = 6,000 steps

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from his daily goal:

10,000 (daily goal) - 2,000 (remaining steps) = 8,000 steps

Now, to find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the total steps he had taken before his jog:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments for May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June

"To find out how much Tim spent in total, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package of fireworks costs twice as much as the first, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The discount on both packages is 20%, so the total cost of the two packages before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200. The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240. Therefore, the cost of the two packages after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.
4. The finale firework costs $150.

Now, we add the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
$960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.

First, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles are considered ""more dangerous"" and have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. Since the problem does not specify a different percentage for the ""more dangerous"" candles, we can assume that the 5% applies to all candles.

So, we calculate 5% of 50,000 candles:
\[ 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

This means that 2500 candles both smell like wet dog and have the defect that makes them more dangerous. However, the problem does not provide information on how many of these 2500 candles will explode. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode cannot be determined.

3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \( x \).

Joanne's total apples are:
\[ 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \]

Joanne's sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister's total apples are:
\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500:
\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the amounts he received from the banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\).

So, the total amount from the banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\).

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get:

\[5000 + 12000 = 17000\]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of $17000."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats carried away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, so:
\[ J - 22 = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]

This means the original price of the jogger jeans \( J \) is:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The total savings is $6, and the savings from the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

This confirms that the savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of the total savings, and the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings.

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $22 = $2 more than the tattered jeans.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. The 4 buses can each hold 60 employees, so the total capacity for the buses is:
   \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees

2. The 6 minibusses can each hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

150 birds"
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket for $100 and having $50 in spending cash, he has $100 - $100 + $50 = $50 left from the money he got from selling the cards.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 + 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. So, for 36 guests, half would be 18 guests, and these 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, which means 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.
3. The remaining 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, which means 18 more hotdogs.
4. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared was 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 18 (for the remaining 18 guests) = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the first hotdog was already provided, and now they all want a second one.

5. Since there were 54 hotdogs prepared, and 40 guests showed up, we can calculate how many hotdogs are left after the first hotdog is given to each guest:
   - 40 guests each get 1 hotdog, so 40 hotdogs are used.
   - 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs are left.

6. These 14 remaining hotdogs would be enough for 14 guests to have a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is:
40 (total guests who showed up) - 14 (guests who got a second hotdog) = 26 guests.

So, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
$132.00"

The total cost of the items is:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the remaining amount:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips and the remaining money from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the cost per serving, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Calculate the total cost of the soup.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he likes to double that amount. So, he will use:
   \[
   2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds of onions}
   \]

2. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the total cost of the onions is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
   \]

3. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is:
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
   \]

4. The total cost of the soup is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock:
   \[
   \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
   \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance covered is \(32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
   - Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats \(16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8\) bails of hay.

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for 8 bails of hay is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills.
   - Therefore, he has \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the change after buying the hay:**
   - Michael spends $24 on hay.
   - Therefore, the change he has is \(30 - 24 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the revenue from the department store:

3. Number of sneakers sold to the department store = Total number of sneakers - Number of sneakers sold at the flash sale
   = 48 - 17
   = 31

4. Revenue from the department store = Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker
   = 31 * $25
   = $775

Now, we calculate the total revenue:

5. Total revenue = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
   = $340 + $775
   = $1115

Finally, we calculate the profit:

6. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $1115 - $576
   = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket for any movie: $20
2. Super ticket includes popcorn and soda for $1 extra: $20 + $1 = $21
3. Regular ticket for any movie: $12
4. Regular ticket + popcorn + soda: $12 + regular price of popcorn + $3 (soda)
5. You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

The cost of the super ticket is:
\[ 21 \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is $2 more than the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 + 2 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \):
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 23 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per balloon before and after the price increase, and then calculate the total cost for 170 balloons after the price increase.

1. First, we find the cost per balloon before the price increase:
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - So, the cost per balloon before the increase is $900 / 20 = $45.

2. Next, we determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - So, the new cost per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

3. Finally, we calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:
   - The total cost for 170 balloons is 170 * $65 = $11,050.

Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase."
"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.**

The volume of a raised bed is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of all 10 raised beds.**

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many bags of potting soil are needed.**

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.**

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, the number of green cards is \(15 + 0.60 \times 15 = 15 + 9 = 24\).
3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards, which is \(15 + 24 = 39\).

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

\[15 + 24 + 39 = 78\]

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that Katelyn saw, making the total number of fairies \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is 45."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed. Finally, we will divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips required.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = \(3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490\) pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

- Number of trips = \(\lceil \frac{4490}{2250} \rceil = \lceil 2.0044 \rceil = 3\).

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"To find out how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many plants Toni has.
2. Use the number of plants Toni has to find out how many plants Shondra has.

First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. We know that Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. 

To find 60% of Frederick's plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to determine how many are allergic to at least one of the substances.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of money Stetson gave up.
Stetson gave up $10 for each orange he ate.
\[ \text{Total amount of money} = 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we can use the information given in the problem.

1. Jillian's shoes cost $80.
2. Her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

First, we calculate 3 times the cost of her shoes:
3 * $80 = $240

Then, we subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of her handbag:
$240 - $20 = $220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220."
"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, we calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds of oats per day.
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) pounds of oats.
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \times 5 = 200\) pounds of oats.
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200}{50} = 4\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians."
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add the highest temperatures of the three countries.
2. Divide the sum by the number of countries (which is 3).

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, we add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries:
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to save is:

$8 + $24 = $32

Sally spends $32 in all."
"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the cost of 1 pack: $4.00.

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 1 pack: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is $2.00.
   - The total number of razors is 8.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, since she is at the top and the height of the pyramid is determined by her height.

60 inches

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches. 

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

60 inches ÷ 12 = 5 feet

The height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day.

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be \( A + 4 \) years old, and this is equal to three times Brett's current age, which is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Angela is currently 38 years old.

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides, the total cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

For the afternoon rides, the total cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/ride} \times 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together, we get:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes the food. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

Final numerical answer:

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, we can determine the width of the rug as follows:

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 3 feet + 5 feet
Width of the rug = 8 feet

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we can calculate the length of the couch as:

Length of the couch = 2 × Width of the rug + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 2 × 8 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet
Length of the couch = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which cost $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $1.
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the number of animals on the farm.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 0 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 animals.

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo:

30 (farm) + 20 (zoo) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars. This leaves Ali with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
4. The weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is:
   \[
   14 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2352 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
5. The weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
   \[
   2016 \text{ kW/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$3024

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, determine how long it takes one person to paint a whole house.
2. Then, calculate how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

Step 1: If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days * 2 = 10 days).

Step 2: If one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, then 5 people working together would theoretically be able to paint the house in 10 days / 5 people = 2 days.

Now, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

From point 2, we can say that Ophelia has \(C_O - 2\) chairs, where \(C_O\) is the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:
\[C_O - 2 = 20\]
\[C_O = 22\]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

From point 3, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has:
\[3 \times 22 = 66\] chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:
\[66 - 2 = 64\] sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Total number of sofas:
\[20 + 64 = 84\]

Total number of chairs:
\[22 + 66 = 88\]

Total number of sofas and chairs:
\[84 + 88 = 172\]

Final numerical answer:
172"
"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Determine how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set. The CD cost $4, so we can find the cost of the headphone set by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \$48 - \$4 = \$44 \]

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy by dividing the total amount of money by the cost of one CD:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\$48}{\$4} = 12 \]

Since Tom already bought one CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, he worked out for 4 hours in \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, we can calculate the total hours:

- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours.

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine Jame's current age:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. Determine Jame's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, the cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).

4. Determine the cousin's current age:
   - If the cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then the cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. Determine the age difference between Jame and his cousin now:
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of the monitors:
\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the printer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) shells.

Let's calculate that:

60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Therefore, each girl brought back 300 seashells.

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

18 vlogs"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second half of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Set the total monthly savings equal to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles

So, Bill will need to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he swims a mile in \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes on a warm day.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- On a cold day, it takes him \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes to swim 3 miles.
- On a warm day, it takes him \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes to swim 3 miles.

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( x \).
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.

4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which means \( x = 4 \).

Now, we need to find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. 

Juan currently drinks \( 5x \) cups, and he needs to reduce his intake to \( x \) cups. So, the reduction needed is:

\[ 5x - x = 4x \]

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and it moves 50 degrees straight upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:

"The first step is to determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, which means the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he is buying one candle for each year of age, he needs 12 candles for the older son and 8 candles for the younger son, which totals 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pack costs $3, so for 4 packs, the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12.

Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/page pair}} \times 2 \text{ pages/page pair} = 70 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 70 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 170 \text{ pages} \]

170 pages"
"Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

Together, they ate:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

5 sandwiches are left."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00/tooth = $3.00. 

For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00/2 = $0.50 per tooth. So for the last two teeth, that's 2 teeth * $0.50/tooth = $1.00.

Adding it all up: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored:
80 - 20 = 60 goals

And since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna scored:

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month is:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
3. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). In this case, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the starting value.
\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Step 2: Add this value to the starting value and then divide by 5.
\[ \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12.
\[ 6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees if her recipe calls for 520 degrees."

\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:

Next, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts when buying 2 boxes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The height of the beanstalk doubles every day, so we can express the height on day \( n \) as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: \( h(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain twice as much protein:

\[ \text{Protein in 200 grams} = 2 \times 3 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find out how much protein John consumes in a week. Since he eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

2. For one of the implants, there is an additional cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[4000 + 500 = 4500\]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[4500 - 600 = 3900\]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[3900 \div 15 = 260\]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, but we only need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 8 quarters = 8 * 5 = 40 nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 dime = 2 nickels, 6 dimes = 6 * 2 = 12 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in the form we need.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 nickel = 5 pennies, 15 pennies = 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
40 (from quarters) + 12 (from dimes) + 14 (from nickels) + 3 (from pennies) = 69 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

69"
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

However, the 12-pound weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds (Ruiz)} + 90 \text{ pounds (Marissa)} = 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 150 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ 1800 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from his original amount:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, his earnings for the first four hours are \(15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = 60 \times \$0.50 = \$30\).

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, his earnings for the next two hours are \(10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = 20 \times \$0.60 = \$12\).

Adding the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = \$30 + \$12 = \$42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles, the total number of rotations per tire is:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ \text{Cost per washing in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washings}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount on the shirt.
2. Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
3. Add the discounted price of the shirt to the price of the shorts to get the total cost.
4. Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount of money.

Let's go through each step:

1. The discount on the shirt is 30% of $25.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 25 = 7.50
   \]

2. The discounted price of the shirt is:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50
   \]

3. The total cost of the shirt and shorts is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50
   \]

4. Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to make the purchase. Therefore, he will not have any money left, and in fact, he will be short by:
   \[
   \text{Shortage} = 52.50 - 50 = 2.50
   \]

However, the question asks for the amount of money Joe will have left, which in this case is negative. So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-2.50}
\]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining 5 months are part of the total 50 months of research.
   - Each of these months cost 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - Therefore, the cost per month for the remaining 5 months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost:

- Cost for the first 5 months: $100,000 * 5 = $500,000
- Cost for the remaining 5 months: $150,000 * 5 = $750,000

Adding these together gives the total cost of the research:

$500,000 + $750,000 = $1,250,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $1,250,000."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

Therefore, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

93000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for water in a year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends:

\[ \$312 \]

on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of seats in the auditorium:**
   - There are 4 rows of seats.
   - Each row has 18 seats.
   - Therefore, the total number of seats is \(4 \times 18 = 72\).

2. **Seats occupied by administrators:**
   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
   - So, the number of seats occupied by administrators is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18\).

3. **Remaining seats after administrators:**
   - The total number of seats is 72.
   - After the administrators, the remaining seats are \(72 - 18 = 54\).

4. **Seats occupied by parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
   - So, the number of seats occupied by parents is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18\).

5. **Seats occupied by students:**
   - The rest of the seats were occupied by the students.
   - The number of seats occupied by students is \(54 - 18 = 36\).

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces of gum are left before he gives any to his sister:

- Remaining gum: \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- Gum given to sister: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces

Finally, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day:

- Remaining gum after giving to sister: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces

So, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left."

On the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

For the remaining four days, the total number of cars towed is:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the number of cars towed in the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

Total number of cars towed that week: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the total revenue from selling the cars:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \text{ per car} = \$250,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \text{ cars} \times \$25,000 \times 30\% = 10 \times \$25,000 \times 0.30 = \$75,000 \]

Now, we determine the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

Finally, we calculate James's commission on the profit:
\[ \text{Commission} = \text{Profit} \times 10\% = \$175,000 \times 0.10 = \$17,500 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we first calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Of these 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women. Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:
17 - 6 = 11 fish.

Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught:
11 + 3 = 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The total cost for 10 classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can attend all 10 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is:

\[ 10 - 0 = 10 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 10 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[
30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500
\]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, we calculate Tim's annual earnings by multiplying his total monthly earnings by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 shirts * $60/shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court:

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers, so:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Next, we find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
360 hours"
"Given that Aurelia has $120, we can determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna's money is:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money of Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"First, let's find out how many employees are in management:

20% of 50 employees = 0.20 * 50 = 10 employees

Now, out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company:

30% of 10 employees = 0.30 * 10 = 3 employees

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for one muffin, and then multiply by 16.

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoon

Total dry ingredients for one muffin = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons

For 16 muffins:
Total dry ingredients = 8.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 132 tablespoons

Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins."
"To find out how much candy each person would have if they shared equally, we first need to calculate the total amount of candy they have together.

Robert has 3 pounds, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. So, the total amount of candy is:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, if they share this candy equally among the three of them, we divide the total amount by 3:

12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy."

10 * $0.75 = $7.50

The total cost of the candies is:
$3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
$15 - $11.00 = $4.00

Therefore, Adam got $4.00 in change."
"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. According to the information provided:

- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The following 8 days were neutral.
- The last 6 days (since 30 - 24 = 6) were 3 good, 1 neutral, and 2 good.

So, let's calculate the number of good days:

- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the last 6 days: 3 (good, neutral, good, good)

Total good days = 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (last 6 days) = 11

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 11."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

To find the number of books Sally has, we need to solve for \( S \):

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. This means James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

24"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

So, for 96 potatoes, we can calculate the number of hash browns as follows:

\[
\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes} \times 36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 16 \times 36 = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"To find out by how much the group of people will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator from this total.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:
   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg.
   - Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

The group of 9 adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

Final answer:
80"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4x + 28 = 44 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 16 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the younger triplet is 4 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the 3 hours he has before he has to eat dinner.

First, let's convert the 3 hours into minutes:
3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, let's add up the time John spends on his homework:
20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we can calculate the total savings for each person:

- Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

- Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of both Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = 2 * $20 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from step 3 into the equation for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's solve for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill}
   - Total Bill - 0.6 \times \text{Total Bill} = $40
   - 0.4 \times \text{Total Bill} = $40
   - \text{Total Bill} = $40 / 0.4
   - \text{Total Bill} = $100.

7. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is **32 dollars**."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

"Given that Mia's restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

Number of regular chairs = 5 * Number of high chairs
Number of regular chairs = 5 * 8
Number of regular chairs = 40

Now, we know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, which means a total of:

Total number of attendees = Number of adults + Number of babies
Total number of attendees = 42 + 15
Total number of attendees = 57

To accommodate all the attendees, Mia needs a total of 57 chairs. She already has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, which together make:

Total number of chairs currently available = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs currently available = 40 + 8
Total number of chairs currently available = 48

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs she currently has from the total number of chairs needed:

Number of additional chairs needed = Total number of chairs needed - Total number of chairs currently available
Number of additional chairs needed = 57 - 48
Number of additional chairs needed = 9

Therefore, Mia has to get 9 more chairs."

- 20 drinks (2 drinks per person)
- 60 snacks (3 snacks per person)

Each drink and snack costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:

20 drinks * $2/drink = $40

And the total cost for snacks is:

60 snacks * $2/snack = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together gives the total amount spent:

$40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $160 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the capacity of Gary's truck can be found by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
\[ 11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald received 3 parts, so he got 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to find out how much money they raised in the first 3 hours. Since the problem states that the amount raised is equal in every hour, we can calculate the hourly rate by dividing the amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3:

$2100 / 3 = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to reach the remaining goal of $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

$4200 / $700 = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, in total, they need to fundraise for:

3 hours (already done) + 6 hours (remaining) = 9 hours

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that percentage from the total percentage of water used by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: The total water used by the city is 40%, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the non-industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of each type of item.
2. Sum up the total cost of all items.
3. Apply the 10% discount for the loyalty card.
4. Provide the final total bill.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Croissants:**
   - 5 croissants at $3.00 each
   - Total cost for croissants = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00

2. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
   - Total cost for cinnamon rolls = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00

3. **Mini Quiches:**
   - 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each
   - Total cost for mini quiches = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00

4. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   - 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each
   - Total cost for blueberry muffins = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, we sum up the total cost of all items:

- Total cost = $15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins)
- Total cost = $50.00

Next, we apply the 10% discount for the loyalty card:

- Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

- Final total bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, let's first calculate how many scoops she can get with her $6.00 under the deal.

The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's find out how much it costs to buy 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00:
\[ \$6.00 \div \$3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 sets of 2 scoops to get 6 scoops in total.

The final numerical answer is:

"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:

\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy, so after two weeks:

- Ginger will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

- Amy will have:

\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:

\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

3. **Savings:**
   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   Savings = $75 - $65
   Savings = $10

James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
2. Multiply the new price by the number of computers (500) to find the total amount paid.

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):

- Right foot: 300 taps per minute
- Left foot: 250 taps per minute

For 3 minutes with her arms down:
- Right foot: \(300 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} = 900 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \, \text{taps/min} \times 3 \, \text{min} = 750 \, \text{taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):

- Right foot: 200 taps per minute
- Left foot: 200 taps per minute

For 2 minutes with her arms raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \, \text{taps/min} \times 2 \, \text{min} = 400 \, \text{taps}\)

Now, we sum up the taps for both feet:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each of the five friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. So, in total, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) slices of pizza.

2. Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices. Therefore, Bryce and his two friends together ate \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) slices.

3. The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices. Therefore, the two remaining friends together ate \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) slices.

4. The total number of slices eaten is \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

5. The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches."

- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we sum the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. Calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = 3 * 4 = 12 ounces.

2. Calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = 7 * 2 = 14 ounces.

3. Calculate the water used for the small cubes:
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = 8 * 1/2 = 4 ounces.

4. Calculate the total water used:
   - Total water used = 12 (giant) + 14 (medium) + 4 (small) = 30 ounces.

5. Calculate the water left:
   - Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
   - Water left = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money spent:

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Let's start with step 1:

- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5

Total number of students who like to bake or play basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, step 2:

Total number of students in the class = 50

Number of students who like to play video games or play music = 50 - 15 = 35

For step 3, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

"To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children.

Total cost for adults in the first park: \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \)
Total cost for children in the first park: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

Total cost for the first amusement park: \( 52 + 24 = 76 \)

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children.

Total cost for adults in the second park: \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \)
Total cost for children in the second park: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

Total cost for the second amusement park: \( 28 + 20 = 48 \)

Now, we find the difference between the total costs of the two parks to determine the savings:
Savings: \( 76 - 48 = 28 \)

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."

1. The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
2. The cost per tomato with the old vendor was $0.50.
3. The difference in cost per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are 500 * $0.10 = $50.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

The vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Combined marbles = 224 + 112
Combined marbles = 336

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 102 small buttons and 100 large buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is 102 + 100 = 202.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to drive to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time to drive back:**
   - Distance back: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Time = 6 hours

4. **Total time gone from home:**
   - Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time to drive back = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

276 wheels"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

The total cost is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
4400"

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \), and the time she finishes the level as \( T_e \) seconds. For Ava, we'll use \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
2. \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
3. \( T_a = T_e + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30(T_e - T_e) = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30(T_e - (T_e + 4)) = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(-4) \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 - 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ -25 \]

15 rides + 6 rides = 21 rides

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 21 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have the equation:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

Let's solve the second equation for \( O \):

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O = 5 + 2W \]

Now substitute \( O = 5 + 2W \) into the first equation:

\[ 5 + 2W + W = 17 \]
\[ 5 + 3W = 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 5 + 2W \):

\[ O = 5 + 2(4) \]
\[ O = 5 + 8 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the total number of fish and the ratio of orange to white fish:

- Total fish bought: \( O + W = 13 + 4 = 17 \)
- Orange fish after buying: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- White fish after buying: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Ratio: \( 16 : 8 = 2 : 1 \)

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate the amount the school will cover.
3. Calculate the amount John needs to raise.
4. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he needs to raise.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school will contribute $300 / 2 = $150.
3. The amount John needs to raise is the total cost minus the school's contribution, which is $300 - $150 = $150.
4. John already has $50, so the amount he is still missing is $150 - $50 = $100.

"To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature inside the house needs to be at least 32 degrees. 

During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. During the night, it is 33 degrees colder, so the temperature at night would be:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

To raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, Carson needs to increase the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood burns and heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are part of the 3/5 fraction that each brings back 2 seashells. We calculate 3/5 of the total number of groups:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups brings back 2 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's 2 * (40/100) = 80/100 or 0.8. Therefore, 400 * 0.8 = 320 fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 680
- Total students: 500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
   \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\(\frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after the additional order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies after the additional order: 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies

Candies sold: 150

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- At the end of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- At the end of February: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- At the end of March: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- At the end of April: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- At the end of May: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Now, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals picked:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or lost is 18 + 3 = 21.

Subtracting this from the original amount, we have 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since they want to make S'mores with the remaining marshmallows and each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can make 14 more S'mores.

If they want to share these equally, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Final numerical answer:
7 S'mores each."

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil used:
\[ \text{Oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces."
"John spends $500 on each of the 3 goats, so the total cost for the goats is:
3 goats * $500/goat = $1500

He also spends $1500 on each of the 2 cows, so the total cost for the cows is:
2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding the cost of the goats and the cows together gives the total amount spent:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent $4500 in total."

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars:

3. 20% of Joe's cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother:

4. Joe gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars to his mother.

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:

5. Joe initially had 40 cars.
6. After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars.
7. After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days together: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Total earnings for the week
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."

"To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to calculate the total number of tins for each type of food and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 tins.

Total tins of cat food = 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food:
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.

Total tins of dog food = 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

Now, we find the difference between the total tins of cat food and dog food:

Difference = 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we can find the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Time spent per week on recording videos = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on recording videos = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Time spent per month on writing songs = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Time spent per week on doing makeup = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Time spent per month on doing makeup = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the time spent into a common unit, such as minutes, to sum them up:

- Total time spent on recording videos in a month = 288 minutes.
- Total time spent on writing songs in a month = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Total time spent on doing makeup in a month = 360 minutes.

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This cost is $129.00.

2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the same distance.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total time for the group is 18 hours. Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can consider the speed of the group as the speed of one kangaroo multiplied by 3. Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \). The distance \( D \) can be calculated as:

\[ D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles is:

\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \( D \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway. 

The final answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

This total amount should be equal to the cost of the laptop minus the extra $50 she still needs:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Combining like terms on the left side:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 230 from both sides:
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Adding these together, the total number of slices Adam has is:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
20 \text{ millimeters}

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money he already has.

The total cost of the car and the phone is:
$10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10800

Gabriel has:
$5000 (from working on weekends) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200

Now, we subtract the amount Gabriel has from the total cost:
$10800 (total cost) - $5200 (amount Gabriel has) = $5600

Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which totals:

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Therefore, Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both math and English) = 12 students good at math.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
2 * 60 = 120 minutes

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for the groups to perform is:
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:
110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11

11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual interest amount.
2. Calculate the total interest over 3 years.
3. Add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount.

Step 1: Determine the annual interest amount.
The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest is:
\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total interest over 3 years.
Since the interest is simple, it accumulates at the same rate each year. Over 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Step 3: Add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount.
\[ \text{Final Amount} = \text{Original Investment} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

The farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays."
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, so he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

The total number of goats left in both farms is:
45 (from Farm X) + 25 (from Farm Y) = 70 goats

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \) or \( S = A - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

Now, let's substitute the expressions for \( A \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now that we know the brother's age, we can find your age:
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
Mr. Jackson has 27 students and wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks per pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7. This will ensure he has enough glue sticks and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, so we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips and subtract that from Rafaela's total:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from Rafaela's total gives Julieta's total:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their totals together:

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), the number of books Anne has as \( A \), and the number of books Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

We can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

First, substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ (F - 12 + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, we can find the weight of the carrots:
- The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that Isaias plans to sell these chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by the boys is:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. The cost of doing her hair is given as $400.
2. The cost of the manicure is 1/4 of the cost of doing her hair. So, the cost of the manicure is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]
3. The cost of the pedicure is 3/4 of the cost of the manicure. So, the cost of the pedicure is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the services:
\[
400 + 100 + 75 = 575

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
- The rope is 20 meters long.
- The price per meter is $2.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah will get is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
- The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
- Since Sarah is buying a rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost of the new rope is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30\).

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope.
- The money Sarah has after selling the rope is $40.
- The cost of the new rope is $30.
- Therefore, the money Sarah will have left over is \( \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \).

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ \text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   - Cost per pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2.

2. **Cost of chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost per packet of chicken = 2 * $2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Cost of strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Cost of apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost per pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

5. **Total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

6. **Money left in Kelly's budget:**
   - Kelly's budget is $65.
   - Money left = Budget - Total cost
   - Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, Kelly has $5 left in her budget."
"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can write this as an equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

Final answer:
25 minutes"

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many microphones can be paired up given that 20% of the microphones won't find a space to fit in.

First, let's calculate 20% of 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't be paired up. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired up is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The daisies have 40 petals.
- The orchids have 25 petals.
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, and Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, we can set up the following equation for the total amount earned from mowing lawns:

\[ 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

Since the total amount earned from mowing lawns is part of the $80 she made, we can write:

\[ 54x = \text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} \]

The total earnings from mowing lawns plus the earnings from lemonade sales is $80:

\[ 54x + \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 \]

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we need to determine \( x \). Since Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, and we know she mowed his lawn once, we can assume the rate for mowing a lawn is $6. Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as:

\[ 54x = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total earnings from mowing lawns, and we know the total earnings are $80, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 54x = 80 - \text{Earnings from lemonade} \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total from mowing lawns, and we know the total is $80, we can find the earnings from lemonade by subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from $80:

\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54x \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total from mowing lawns, and we know the total is $80, we can find \( x \) by dividing the total earnings from mowing lawns by 54:

\[ x = \frac{80 - \text{Earnings from lemonade}}{54} \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total from mowing lawns, and we know the total is $80, we can find the earnings from lemonade by subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from $80:

\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54x \]

Since \( 54x \) is the total from mowing lawns, and we know the total is $80, we can find the earnings from lemonade by subtracting the earnings from mowing lawns from $80:

\[ \text{Earnings from lemonade} = 80 - 54 \left(\frac{80}{54}\right) = 80 - 80 = 0 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls of soup for the children (4 total adult bowls - 2 adult bowls for Calvin and his wife).

Calvin has 2 children, and each child's bowl is 1/4 the size of an adult's bowl. Therefore, 2 adult bowls of soup can fill 8 child bowls (2 adult bowls * 4 child bowls per adult bowl).

Calvin and his wife will eat 2 adult bowls, leaving 8 child bowls for the children. Since there are 2 children, each child will get 4 bowls of soup (8 child bowls / 2 children).

Now, let's consider the leftover soup for lunch. After the dinner, there will be no leftover soup because all 8 child bowls will be consumed by the children. Therefore, the number of times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is 0.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Adding the material needed for the small and large masks together:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit Kira bought = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

So, the number of pieces left = 14 - 2 = 12 pieces

12 pieces are left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, which totals \(16 + 22 = 38\) students playing soccer.

Now, we add these numbers together to get the total number of students:

\[6 + 12 + 38 = 56\]

So, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means Josh eats 4 slices a day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf has 24 slices, so to find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

24 slices ÷ 6 slices/day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, over 5 years, she would have collected 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea} \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

12

So, the final numerical answer is:

12"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

2000"

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add it all up:

- Initial balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 = 9 balloons
- Additional balloons given by her mom: 15 balloons

Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24 balloons

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

1. Calculate the total number of widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000 in a month:
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets = 60 * 24 * 30

2. Calculate the total number of widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000 in a month:
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets = 45 * 24 * 30

3. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 = (60 * 24 * 30) * 6
   - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000 = (45 * 24 * 30) * 6

4. Find the difference in revenue:
   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total widgets produced by the Widgeteer 3000:
   60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200

2. Total widgets produced by the WidgetMaster 9000:
   45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400

3. Revenue from selling the widgets:
   - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 * 6 = $259,200
   - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 * 6 = $194,400

4. Difference in revenue:
   $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

For the 15 goats, Nate needs 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay.

For the 12 sheep, Nate needs 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.

159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:

"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

$40 (visit) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

**Total Charge**: $205"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   - James gets 10 CDs.
   - Each CD costs $15.
   - Total cost before discount = 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40%.
   - Discount amount = 40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $150 - $60 = $90.

4. **Calculate the money James gets from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sells 5 CDs for $40 each.
   - Total money from selling 5 CDs = 5 CDs * $40/CD = $200.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out of pocket:**
   - He spent $90 on the CDs.
   - He got $200 from selling 5 CDs.
   - Net amount out of pocket = Total cost after discount - Money from selling 5 CDs = $90 - $200 = -$110.

Since the net amount is negative, it means James actually gained $110 from the transaction. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

James was out $110."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims before resting.
2. Calculate the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the resting time.
4. Calculate the remaining distance.
5. Calculate the new swimming speed.
6. Calculate the time it takes to swim the remaining distance.
7. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims before resting:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the first 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **New swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Time to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

At the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times sales.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, for the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Adding the two amounts together gives the total commission:
\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the three players is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, we substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each paper is printed on both sides, one side of a paper corresponds to one page in the book. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is:

The book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. Kim's usual sleep schedule is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes.
2. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.
3. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.
4. To find out how long she was asleep, we need to calculate the time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. and then subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking.

From 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. is 2 hours or 120 minutes.
From 12 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is 355 minutes.

So, the total time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 120 + 355 = 475 minutes.

Now, subtract the 23 minutes she was sleepwalking:

475 minutes - 23 minutes = 452 minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds initially = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is \( 7J \) and we know that \( 7J = 7 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

Total holes at the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\)

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

**Final Answer:**

"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got:

\[70 + 70 = 140\]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so Collins got:

\[70 + 15 = 85\]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[140 + 85 = 225\]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

225"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:

\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the end of the day:

- Initial brownies: 12
- Brownies from office party: +6
- Brownies from surprise party: +48
- Total before eating: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66
- Brownies eaten during the surprise party: -18

So, the number of brownies left over is:

66 - 18 = 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, the sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, the total cost is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes = 1/4 of the total boxes

To find the total number of boxes, we can set up the equation:
8 boxes = 1/4 * total boxes

Solving for the total number of boxes:
total boxes = 8 boxes * 4 = 32 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is:
32 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 640 oranges

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of oranges she kept is:
1/4 * 640 oranges = 160 oranges

The number of oranges she sold is the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges she kept:
640 oranges - 160 oranges = 480 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 480 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost of the books is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide $25 by $5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, the cherries that Jerry has can be calculated by subtracting the cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total: \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\).

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Over 8 days, she will use:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle:

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate the price of the red car:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. Therefore, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players in the class.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early today."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which means Charlie wears size 5 * 5 = size 25 boots.

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional plants Pat needs to fill her flower bed, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them.

Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[ 1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[ 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Pat will spend:

\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week (7 days), his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

63"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket has 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost for petunias in one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost for sweet potato vines in one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
- The total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3 roses"
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that amount each month.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year.

First, let's find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $500.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. Since $500.00 is less than the cost of one pair of shoes, she cannot buy any pairs of shoes with that amount each month.

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:

- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

Net change in temperature: \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, we can denote this as:

\[ \text{Age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet} = 30 \]

Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is:

\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting of the Comet is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the Comet the first time} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. Electric bill: Once per month, so \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.
2. Gas bill: Once per month, so \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.
3. Church: Twice per month, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: Quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks per year.

Now, we add up all the checks:
\[12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\]

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is 11."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

\(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his mother and father and then subtract that from the cost of the trousers.

1. Adam's mother gave him $6.
2. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
3. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
4. The cost of the trousers is $30.

Now, we subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:

\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(Al\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(Al = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + Al + H + W = 20\)
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + Al + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2200, so the lawyer's contribution is:

3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient check takes 20 minutes.

Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.

Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments into hours:
- Total time for inpatient rounds = 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.
- Total time for appointments = 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the 9 hours available:
- Time left to update records = 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours).

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population after a year.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the total number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the total number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population after a year:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Matteo = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance_Shandy = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:

Distance_Shandy - Distance_Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

230 miles"
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old

   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( C \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ C \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ C \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final numerical answer:
3"
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and how many are portraits.

First, we know that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally among 8 albums. So, we can find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

This means each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are for selfies only and 2 of the albums are for portraits only. This means there are 3 albums with only selfies and 2 albums with only portraits. The remaining 3 albums (8 total albums - 3 selfies - 2 portraits) must contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but the problem does not specify the distribution in these albums, so we can assume they are not relevant to the count of selfies and portraits.

Since the 3 albums with only selfies contain 9 pictures each, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And since the 2 albums with only portraits contain 9 pictures each, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests.
5. After the afternoon check-ins, the number of guests increases by 30:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \):
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily consumption and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from the cookies.

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from the cupcakes.

In total, she earned $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 * $10 = $20.

Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $320 - $20 = $300.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich and then use that to calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich for the first package is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich for the second package is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches at $1.5 per sandwich is \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

   - 25 red balloons
   - 7 green balloons
   - 12 yellow balloons

2. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

3. Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons:
   - Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

4. Sally finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.6 - 0.5 \times 0.8 - 0.6 \times 0.8 + 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.48 + 0.24) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 76\% \]

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it will take to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's calculate the number of soda bottles. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and Richard wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of intervals between the bottles is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ intervals} \]

Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the number of bottles is one more than the number of intervals:

\[ 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine the total time it will take Richard to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[ 8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money with his new, higher income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked during college:**
   - Since he didn't work during college, he lost out on $25,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off his loans and make up for the lost income:**
   - Total amount needed = Total amount borrowed + Total amount lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

6. **Calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the total amount needed:**
   - Time needed = Total amount needed / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters delivered on each day:
   \[
   425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

So, the average loss per race is approximately $7.17.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

Final numerical answer:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 * 7 days = 21 days

2. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked per day:**
   - 3/8 of a day = 3/8 * 24 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day)
   - 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours

3. **Calculate the total number of hours each painter worked over the 21 days:**
   - 9 hours/day * 21 days = 189 hours

4. **Since there are 4 painters, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked:**
   - 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

The formula for the value of an item after depreciation is:

\[ V = P(1 - r)^n \]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value after depreciation,
- \( P \) is the original price,
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.21 \),
- \( n = 3 \).

Plugging in the values:

\[ V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000(0.79)^3 \]
\[ V = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ V \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many tiles are needed to cover the kitchen floor.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their price.

Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.
- Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
- Each tile costs $12.
- The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the total annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the insurance cost increased by 60% due to the accident. To find 60% of $120, we use the following calculation:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost is $72. Now, we add this to the normal monthly cost to get the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

James now pays $192 per month for his insurance. To find the total annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year for his insurance is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads for the twin sheets.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load for the king sheet.

So, Greg does 8 + 1 = 9 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much food is consumed by one cat in one day:
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of food twice a day.
- Therefore, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) of food per day.

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
- \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) of food per day.

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
- \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up all the individual charges:

1. Cast: $200

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
   - The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. Now, we calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both groups.
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he can take advantage of the promotion by buying 3 pounds at the full price and getting 3 pounds at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For the first 3 pounds, the cost is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

For the next 3 pounds (at half price), the cost is:
3 pounds * ($4.00/pound * 0.5) = 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00

Adding these together, the total cost is:
$12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter."
"To determine the cost of Kayla's party, we need to follow these steps:

2. Subtract the number of guests who couldn't come.
3. Determine the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the rental fee and the additional guests.

Let's start with the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left.
Riza has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this is the number of bananas eaten in one day, the number of bananas eaten in a week (7 days) is:
\[7(24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[7(24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train and then find the difference between the time Paul boards the fourth train and the time he arrives at the station.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departs 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20 = 30).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train departs (30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul arrives).
   - Stays for 1/4 of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departs 5 minutes after it arrives (60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul arrives).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train departs (65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul arrives).
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes after Paul arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train departs (125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul arrives).

Paul will board the fourth train at 145 minutes after he arrives at the station. Since he arrives at the station at time 0, he will wait 145 minutes for his train.

**Final Answer:**
145"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks she needs for the sculpture."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Determine the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for is \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $1800.
   - The discount is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) dollars.
   - The percentage discount is \(\frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%\).

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.
- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference in cost between buying individually and buying in bunches:
- The cost of buying individually is $32.
- The cost of buying in bunches is $30.
- Therefore, the amount saved is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the farmer makes a total of:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the truck picks up a total of:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Normal periods**: 6 periods
2. **Extra classes**: 2 extra classes
3. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
4. **Days in a week**: 5 days (Monday to Friday)
5. **Extra learning time**: 1/16 of the weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday

First, calculate the total time spent in classes during the week:

- Total classes per day: 6 + 2 = 8 classes
- Duration of each class: 40 minutes
- Total time spent in classes per day: 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes
- Total time spent in classes per week: 320 minutes/day * 5 days = 1600 minutes

Next, calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:

- Total weekly minutes: 1600 minutes
- Extra learning time: 1/16 of the weekly minutes
- Extra learning time per day: (1/16) * 1600 minutes = 100 minutes
- Total extra learning time per week: 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes

Now, add the time spent in classes and the extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

- Total weekly learning time: 1600 minutes (classes) + 200 minutes (extra learning) = 1800 minutes

Finally, convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:

- Total weekly learning time in hours: 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

\[
\boxed{\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}}

"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas.
5. After her brother takes his sodas, there are 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas left.

Ellen's friend will get one of the remaining sodas. The total number of sodas left is 2 (shaken) + 7 (unshaken) = 9 sodas.

The probability that the soda Ellen's friend gets is one of the shaken ones is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days
- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

### Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works
- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps
- Billy can help 2 people per hour.
- He works 3 hours a day.
- So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.
- Over 40 days, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

Billy helps 240 people."
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. 

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is:

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 16 \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - The amount saved each year is $20,000.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years.

"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take one of these 25 cm parts and divide it into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, which has 30 days, Soledad needs to cover a certain number of miles per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of miles she would cover in 30 days if she walks 250 miles each day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since her goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to reach her goal. The difference between her goal and the distance she would cover at 250 miles per day is:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from red balls:
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. Calculate the revenue from blue balls:
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. Calculate the revenue from green balls:
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls:
   - Total revenue: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

James will have 5 kilograms of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after each step:

1. Initial amount: $21
2. After saving $11: $21 + $11 = $32
3. After spending $5 on a comic book: $32 - $5 = $27
4. After spending $19 on a puzzle: $27 - $19 = $8

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is $8."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

Final numerical answer:

"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year is:

50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

Final numerical answer:
60"
"To solve this problem, we can use a proportion to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, given that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

First, let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{x \text{ minutes}}
\]

Now, we can solve for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{459 \text{ blinks} \times 5 \text{ minutes}}{255 \text{ blinks}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{459 \times 5}{255}
\]

\[
x = \frac{2295}{255}
\]

\[
x = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

9 minutes"

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's dog-walking chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours, so let's say Dior took at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours, but since it's ""well over,"" we can assume it took at least 9 hours, but for the sake of a final numerical answer, we'll use 9 hours as the minimum.

Adding up the time for all chores:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{mph} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 12 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by the first four workers:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means the first four workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers Luis had were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Luis received \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers from Seth.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the third equation into the second equation to find \( S \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted is 56. So, we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \, \text{crayons} \times 1 \, \text{ounce/crayon} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \, \text{boxes} \times 8 \, \text{ounces/box} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \, \text{ounces} + 200 \, \text{ounces} = 400 \, \text{ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \, \text{ounces}}{16 \, \text{ounces/pound}} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

25 pounds"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 * $1.2 = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."

"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach.

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write:

\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile. To find out how long it takes her to walk this 1 mile, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time spent on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."

So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If Bob loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5
\]

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 200 - 132

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added:
\[ \text{Total cows} = 50 \text{ (initial)} + 420 \text{ (added)} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Total chickens} = 20 \text{ (initial)} + 210 \text{ (added)} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:

"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Each pack costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost before discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 10%.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**
   - Each pack contains 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. **Calculate the cost per bagel:**
   - Cost per bagel = Total cost after discount / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

Therefore, the cost of each single bagel after the discount is $1.00."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write this as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiplying gives \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - So, \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2, we get \(x = 27\).

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

Dividing both sides by 14, we find:

\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
4. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets over 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers.
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Sunflowers sold from bouquets per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from individual sales + Sunflowers from bouquets.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Total sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

Therefore, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100.
2. Calculate how many rocks he sells (60% of his inventory).
3. Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks.
4. Calculate the cost of the rocks he sold.
5. Determine the loss by subtracting the revenue from the cost.

Let's go through each step:

1. Adam can buy rocks for $5 each. With $100, he can buy:
   \[
   \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. He sells 60% of his inventory. So, the number of rocks he sells is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

3. The revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each is:
   \[
   12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The cost of the 12 rocks he sold is:
   \[
   12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The loss is the cost of the rocks sold minus the revenue from selling them:
   \[
   60 - 84 = -24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the result is negative, it means Adam actually makes a profit of $24, not a loss. However, the question asks for the loss, which in this case is $0 because he doesn't incur a loss but rather a profit.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of scene and then sum these times.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum the days required for each type of scene:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \]

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Initial time: 2 hours
- Additional time: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of winning with the second ticket and then find the probability that both tickets are winners.

1. The probability of winning with the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60 or 60%.

3. The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning with each ticket, assuming the events are independent.

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets being winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

\[ 0.12 \times 100\% = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = \$40 - \$20 = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times \$20 = \$80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:
\[ \$40 + \$80 = \$120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \$120 \]"
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to determine the total number of bottles required and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed to cover 100% of the daily energy demand for 2300 people.

Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need:
\[ \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles} \]

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles Hortex can produce from the total number of bottles required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
50%"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One quarter of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). Therefore, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(x - 200\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Since a 10-year-old produces 1000 fruits, we can find the number of fruits produced by an 8-year-old:

\[x - 200 = 1000 - 200 = 800\]

So, an 8-year-old produces 800 fruits.

Now, we can sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ R = 4B \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

We can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. First, we express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Then, we express \( R \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y + Y + Y - 28 - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
   \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \).

3. After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money, so we can write the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

4. Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

6. Now, we know that Ronnie and Rissa each gave $3 to their little sister. So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, so we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

We are also told that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{total paint} \]

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Now, we can express the total amount of paint as the sum of the amounts of each color:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( R = W = P \) and \( Y = 6 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he uses to pay the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has now is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage and the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).
   - The chalk after \( n \) days can be expressed as \( C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \).

3. **Find the number of days \( n \) before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - We need to solve for \( n \) in the inequality \( 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \).

4. **Solve the inequality:**
   - \( (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \)
   - \( (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11} \)
   - Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:
     \[
     \ln((0.8)^n) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
     \]
     \[
     n \ln(0.8) < \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
     \]
     \[
     n > \frac{\ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\ln(0.8)}
     \]
   - Calculate the values:
     \[
     \ln\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.3365
     \]
     \[
     \ln(0.8) \approx -0.2231
     \]
     \[
     n > \frac{-0.3365}{-0.2231} \approx 1.507
     \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine how many girls and boys are on varsity, and then subtract those numbers from the total number of girls and boys, respectively.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the number of girls not on varsity:
   - Number of girls not on varsity = Total number of girls - Number of girls on varsity.
   - Number of girls not on varsity = \( 12 - 4 = 8 \).

4. Calculate the number of boys not on varsity:
   - Number of boys not on varsity = Total number of boys - Number of boys on varsity.
   - Number of boys not on varsity = \( 12 - 3 = 9 \).

5. Calculate the total number of students not on varsity:
   - Total number of students not on varsity = Number of girls not on varsity + Number of boys not on varsity.
   - Total number of students not on varsity = \( 8 + 9 = 17 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

"To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
2. Calculate the refund based on the cost per gallon.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date.
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of it had passed the expiry date.
\[ \text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Step 2: Calculate the refund.
The cost per gallon is $3.5, so the refund amount is:
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$5600 \]"
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

   - Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket.
   - 5 more apples fell out of the tree.

2. Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Newton now has 1 (from the first pocket) + 1 (from the second pocket) = 2 apples in his pocket.
   - 6 more apples fell out of the tree.

3. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.
   - Newton now has 2 (from the first pocket) + 6 (from the second pocket) = 8 apples in his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 8."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and then convert that into the number of whole pizzas.

First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total cheese pizza slices = 6 slices/friend * 6 friends = 36 slices.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices her friends will eat:
- Each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices.
- Kate has 6 friends.
- Total pepperoni pizza slices = 4 slices/friend * 6 friends = 24 slices.

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required:
- A cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Total cheese pizzas needed = 36 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.
- A pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Total pepperoni pizzas needed = 24 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 3 pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay has after accounting for the melting is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs per hour.

4. **Target Number of Snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how long it will take to have 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net number of snowballs built per hour:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old at the time Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 4 years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time.

So, Jim's current age is 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since it's not possible to have a negative number of bandages, this means they ran out of bandages and had to order more. They ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(50 - 28 = 22\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(22 + 100 - 25 = 97\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\).

- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \(x + 34 + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

We know that at the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left, so:
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This negative value indicates an error in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct understanding that they had to order more bandages to cover the deficit.

The correct calculation should be:
- After the first day: \(x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\)
- After the second day: \(x + 12 + 50 - 28 = x + 34\)
- After the third day: \(x + 34 + 100 - 25 = x + 109\)

Since they had 78 bandages left, the initial number of bandages \(x\) must be:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This negative value indicates an error in the problem setup or interpretation. Given the problem constraints, the correct initial number of bandages should be re-evaluated to ensure it aligns with the given final count. The correct initial number of bandages, considering the problem constraints, is:

\[x = 31\]

So, the nurses started with 31 bandages on the first day.

"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**

Alain has 75 pens."
"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac. Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors. Now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses up 3 colors from that set. This means she loses 3 more colors. Now she has \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

- Third dog: 3 miles

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the loan amount:**
   - The house is worth $250,000.
   - John gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value.
   - Loan amount = 40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.

2. **Determine the amount used to pay off debts:**
   - John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
   - Amount used to pay off debts = 60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. **Determine the leftover amount:**
   - The leftover amount is the loan amount minus the amount used to pay off debts.
   - Leftover amount = $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

The buying price is $72. 

The selling price is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"The dehumidifier's settings remove water as follows:
- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 liters per day (twice as much as the low setting)
- High setting: 4 liters per day (twice as much as the medium setting)

Brian ran the dehumidifier for:
- 3 days on the low setting: 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
- 3 days on the medium setting: 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
- 5 days on the high setting: 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

The total amount of water removed is:
3 liters (low) + 6 liters (medium) + 20 liters (high) = 29 liters

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:

- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons:

- They had 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of balloons they threw is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the amount of the second medicine. The problem states that the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine. Since the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 \text{ mL} = 42 \text{ mL}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find the total amount of medicine for one dose. This is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts:
   \[
   14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. Finally, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine for one dose by 8:
   \[
   56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's classes each have a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."
"Jordan's 2 children require a total of 5 diapers each per day, so together they require 2 * 5 = 10 diapers per day.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]

3. At the second station, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first station entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second station is:
   \[\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second station is:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]

4. At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]

5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[20\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total number of students and then figure out how many sessions are required given that only 8 students can participate at a time.

1. There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) and each grade has 10 students in the top 10 for earning points.
2. Therefore, the total number of students is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Since only 8 students can participate in each session, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students per session:

\[ \frac{40}{8} = 5 \]

This means that 5 sessions are required for all 40 students to try the escape room.

Since each session takes 45 minutes, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is:

\[ 5 \times 45 = 225 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room."
"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. 

The total cost for the wooden tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

The total cost for the roof frames is:

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount Ali has to pay John:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. Cost for the remaining minutes:
   - The call is 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes
   - $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final numerical answer is:
$8.00"

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discounted price for a manicure = $35 - (20% of $35) = $35 - ($35 * 0.20) = $35 - $7 = $28
Discounted price for a pedicure = $40 - (20% of $40) = $40 - ($40 * 0.20) = $40 - $8 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails.
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).

Cost of nail art = 20 nails * $3 per nail = $60

Step 3: Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.
Total cost = Discounted price for a manicure + Discounted price for a pedicure + Cost of nail art
Total cost = $28 + $32 + $60 = $120

Therefore, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues per magazine. So, we need to consider the number of magazines individually:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's break down the price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. For veteran lessons, he reduces his rate by 25%. 

First, let's calculate the reduced rate for veteran lessons:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

So, the reduced rate is:
$80 - $20 = $60 per hour for veteran lessons.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from the 4 standard lessons:
4 lessons * $80 per lesson = $320

Next, let's calculate the total earnings from the 2 veteran lessons:
2 lessons * $60 per lesson = $120

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats.
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats.
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats.

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

Step 1: The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick is:
\[ \frac{15.00 \text{ dollars}}{30 \text{ sticks}} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we have:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights.
2. There are 8 rooms in the house, and there are 2 flashlights for each room, so there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
3. The total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the candles:
1. There are 4 small candles each for half the rooms. Since there are 8 rooms, half of the rooms is \(8 / 2 = 4\). So, there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
2. There are 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms, which is also 4 rooms. So, there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
3. The total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

Adding the flashlights and candles together, we get:
\[20 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 56\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
   \[ \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles in one day by the number of workdays in a week.

Step 1: Convert the hours spent at work into minutes.
Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes spent at work each day as follows:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of calls he can handle in one day.
It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. Therefore, the number of calls he can handle in one day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls he handles in a 5-day work week.
\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish: 7 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish: 12 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To determine the total amount of water Crista needs for her plants every day, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering requirements for the plants.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
   \(4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\) cups

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
   \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we need to find out how many plants this is:
   Total plants = 20
   Plants needing half a cup = 4
   Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   Plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8
   So, for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards, with half of that distance on land and the other half in water. This means he will hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Hopping speed on land: 20 yards per minute
- Distance to hop: 100 yards
- Time to hop = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Swimming speed in water: 10 yards per minute
- Distance to swim: 100 yards
- Time to swim = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \). We know that \( 2x = 20 \), so \( x = 10 \).

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \).

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be found by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (day 1) + 70 (day 2) + 140 (day 3) + 240 (days 4 to 7) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"

"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night at the hotel is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

Therefore, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during that trip."
"Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means Dallas received \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles from Mazie.

To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had initially:

\[52 - 25 = 27\]

"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then add them together.

1. The cost of the adult tickets: 2 adults * $12/adult = $24
2. The cost of the child ticket: 1 child * $8/child = $8
3. The cost of the popcorns: 2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:

Total cost = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket + Cost of popcorns
Total cost = $24 + $8 + $6
Total cost = $38

They pay a total of $38."
"To find the force needed to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, the total weight of the children is 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds.

Adding these together, the total weight is:
1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds.

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we calculate:
1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost on the way, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount each person raised and then sum these amounts.

First, we know that Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so we calculate Kim's amount as follows:
\[ \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Next, we know that Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so we calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
\[ \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Now, we sum the amounts raised by all four girls:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 700 + 300 \]

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to determine how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 2 miles. We know that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile is:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is twice that of Aaron's:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Vanessa} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. With 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Number of reservations per night**: 6
2. **Number of meals per reservation**: 2
3. **Cost per meal**: $5
4. **Cost of wine per reservation**: $5
5. **Number of days the restaurant is open per week**: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)
- Cost of wine per reservation: \$5
- Total cost per reservation: \(\$10 + \$5 = \$15\)

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations on one open day:
- Total cost for 6 reservations: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

Finally, calculate the total cost for the week:
- Total cost for 2 open days: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

So, the restaurant makes \(\$180\) a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.

"To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices.
2. Divide the total number of slices by the number of people.

First, we calculate the total number of slices:
7 pizzas * 8 slices per pizza = 56 slices

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends, so 4 people in total):
56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person

Each person can have 14 slices."
