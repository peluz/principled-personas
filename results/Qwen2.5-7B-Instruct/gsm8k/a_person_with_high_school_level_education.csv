"First, let's determine how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking muffins.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs used per day is:

\[3 + 4 = 7\]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs she has left to sell:

\[16 - 7 = 9\]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is:

\[9 \times 2 = 18\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{18}\]"

"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the purchase price and add it to the purchase price.

The purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the purchase price plus the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the distance James runs in one session:**
   James runs 3 sprints in one session.
   \[
   \text{Distance per session} = 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters per sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:**
   James runs 3 times a week.
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 3 \text{ sessions per week} \times 180 \text{ meters per session} = 540 \text{ meters}
   \]

So, the total distance James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken gets:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount of feed required for the entire flock of 20 chickens:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ 140 \text{ cups} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the first glass:**
   - The cost of one glass is $5.

2. **Determine the cost of the second glass:**
   - The second glass costs 60% of $5.
   - \( 60\% \) of $5 is calculated as \( 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost for pairs of glasses:**
   - Each pair (one at $5 and one at $3) costs \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the number of pairs in 16 glasses:**
   - Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, and each pair consists of 2 glasses, the number of pairs is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost for 8 pairs:**
   - The total cost for 8 pairs is \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of sheep each city has in terms of the number of sheep Seattle has.

1. Let the number of sheep Seattle has be \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep, so \( S = 20 \).

Next, we need to find the number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse.

3. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep in Charleston, \( C \), is:
   \[
   C = 4 \times S = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

4. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep in Toulouse, \( T \), is:
   \[
   T = 2 \times C = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

Now, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together.

5. The total number of sheep is:
   \[
   T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \( 260 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Add the time for the final download:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

So, the total time it takes to download the file is **120 minutes**."
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point where he turns around.

John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

This means John is 180 miles away from home when he turns around.

Next, we need to determine how far John travels back towards home in the 4 hours he spends trying to get home.

John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time.

Then, he drives for the next 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at a speed of 30 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \]

After this, he drives the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances he covered while driving:
\[ \text{Total distance covered} = 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles} = 135 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he initially was 180 miles away from home, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance from home} = 180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

**Final Answer:**
Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the downloads in the second month = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Then, subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 \).

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is **366**."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the final total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
   \[
   \$7.5 \times n
   \]
   We set this equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point:
   \[
   7.5n = 90
   \]
   Solving for \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

These 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value increase: \( 5000 \times \frac{2.5}{100} = 5000 \times 0.025 = 125 \)
   - New value of jewelry: \( 5000 + 125 = 5125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value increase: \( 8000 \times \frac{1.2}{100} = 8000 \times 0.012 = 96 \)
   - New value of electronic gadgets: \( 8000 + 96 = 8096 \)

Now, we compare the new values:
- New value of jewelry: $5125
- New value of electronic gadgets: $8096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the difference between the new value and the initial value:
\[ 8096 - 8000 = 96 \]

Therefore, the profit from choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."

"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both teaching and coaching separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is:

"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Identify the distance at which Henry made his first stop: 20 miles.
3. Identify the distance at which Henry made his second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, his second stop was at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

Now, we need to find the distance between his first stop (20 miles) and his second stop (45 miles):

\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled \(\boxed{25}\) miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total age.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means if Darrell's age is \(7x\) and Allen's age is \(11x\), their total age is \(7x + 11x = 18x\).

We know their total age is 162, so we can set up the equation:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's current age is 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(80 \times 0.25 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs:
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
   - John has 10 dogs.
   - So, the total daily care time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

2. Calculate the weekly care time:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total weekly care time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, Aaron has 5 more than 20 jewels:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Since Aaron has 25 jewels, Siobhan has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"First, we determine how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes, where he scored 4 points.

To find 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 \text{ points} + 5 \text{ points} = 9 \text{ points} \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \$75.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total money John gets from selling the lego sets:**

"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed. Speed is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time.

First, let's determine the total time John spends running each week.

1. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
2. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\]

Next, we know the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles.

Now, we can calculate his average speed:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"First, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

When Polly is not holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. Therefore, when holding the gemstone, she can throw it for:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the dragon's reach from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many calories are left for the day after you've already consumed 1800 calories out of your 2000-calorie target.

2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories (remaining for the day)

Next, we need to find out how many calories one serving of chips contains:
- A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many servings you can have with the remaining 200 calories:
- 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings

Since each serving is part of a 300g bag, we can calculate the grams you can eat:
- 0.8 servings * 300g per bag = 240g

So, you can eat 240 grams of chips. 

**Final Answer:**
240 grams"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:

"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
  \[
  5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

According to the problem, after using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

The wire is 4 feet long, so in inches, it is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, the total number of units is:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units/floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

\[ 30 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

   - Distance = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. **Calculate the time to travel back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
   - Tom's ship travels back at 6 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the materials and construction for the brooch. Janet pays $500 for the materials and $800 for the jeweler to construct it. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total amount to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the original total cost to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1430} \]"
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial annual pension**: Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

2. **Determine the additional pension after 20 years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

3. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years**: Since she quits after 30 years, she will have been entitled to the additional 5% for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

4. **Calculate the total annual pension after 30 years**:
   - The initial annual pension is $50,000.
   - The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

5. **Add the initial and additional pensions**:
   - Total annual pension = Initial annual pension + Additional annual pension
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be **$52,500**."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service over the course of a year, considering the different rates for the first and second halves of the year.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge for the first half is $140.
   - Total cost for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge for the second half is 10% less than $140.

   - Subtract this from $140 to get the reduced rate: \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is **$1596**."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information given.

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
2. To find the miles per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
   \[
   \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]

3. Now, we know that her car can travel 25 miles per gallon. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank by multiplying the mpg by the tank capacity:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time he spends on TV and reading in one week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}\]

"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 5 (girls) + 5 (boys) = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2

Therefore, for each school, the total number of people is:
- 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people from all schools is:
- 12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people

"First, let's determine the number of rubies. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

Next, we need to find the number of emeralds. The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds as the rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds as:

\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of gems in the chest. We do this by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is:

\[ \boxed{595} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of students at the school. This is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

We know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers is:

"First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches in a week.

- From Monday to Friday, she teaches 5 classes each day. That's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Judy charges $15.00 per student. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes in a week is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

"Let's define the number of games the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is 22, so we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"First, let's determine the number of pets each person has based on the information given.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we add up the total number of pets:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - So, Corey is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - So, Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - So, Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, let's determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means his new time is 90% of his original time. We calculate this as:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. So, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 40 \]"
"First, we need to calculate how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[ \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used **12 tomatoes**."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away. She received 18 new potted plants yesterday, so the total number of plants she has before giving any away is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

After giving away 40 plants, the number of plants she will have left is:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

The total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

"Let's break it down:

- John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. That's 3 glasses of water per day.
- He also drinks a glass of water before bed, which adds another glass per day.
- So, during the weekdays (Monday to Friday), he drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water per day.
- Over 5 weekdays, that's \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday):
- He drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner.
- So, he drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water per day on both Saturday and Sunday.
- Over the weekend, that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) glasses of water.

Adding the weekdays and the weekend together:
- Total glasses of water in a week = \(20 + 8 = 28\).

**Final Answer: 28**"

"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

- Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length × width × height.

\[ \text{Inner volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Final Answer:**
72 cubic inches"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Now, let's calculate the total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since he watched 7 hours in total, the remaining hours must be from Wednesday:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

On Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Since each episode is 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours), we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total hours by the length of each episode:
\[1.5 \div 0.5 = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Julia's boat took on by the time she reached the shore. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance to the shore:**
   - Julia took 64 seconds to reach the shore.
   - It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, the distance to the shore in feet is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}}\right) \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - To find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}

Therefore, the boat had taken on \(\boxed{16}\) liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson involves the use of the whiteboard.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the total number of lessons for all teachers in a day:
- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Therefore, the total number of lessons in a day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
- Total cleanings per day = \(8 \times 3 = 24\).

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"First, we calculate the total number of flowers Ryan plants in 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers a day, we multiply 2 by 15:

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships given step by step.

1. **Determine the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Therefore, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is:
     \[
     \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     300 = 50x
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{50} = 6

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She sells each board at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price.
- New price per 2x4x10 board = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She sells each board at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price.
- New price per 4x4x10 board = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."

"First, let's calculate the number of vehicles that were initially at the port from the 2 containers:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's determine Lylah's initial salary. We know that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the following equation to find Lylah's initial salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's salary} = \text{Lylah's salary} + 0.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ 40000 = 1.30 \times \text{Lylah's salary} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{40000}{1.30} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = \frac{400000}{13} \]
\[ \text{Lylah's salary} = 30769.23 \]

Next, we need to find Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40 percent from his initial salary of $40,000:

\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 0.40 \times 40000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40000 + 16000 \]
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 56000 \]

Now, we need to find Lylah's salary four years later. Since both salaries increased simultaneously by the same percentage, Lylah's salary also increased by 40 percent:

\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 0.40 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 30769.23 + 12307.69 \]
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 43076.92 \]

Finally, we add Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries to find the total salary they were receiving four years later:

\[ \text{Total salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \]
\[ \text{Total salary} = 99076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."

   - Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = Speed × Time = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

3. **Total distance:**
   - Total distance = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining 4 hours = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours."
"First, let's determine how many letters Jennie stamped. She put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters. These 20 letters are now added to the pile of already-stamped letters. Initially, there were some letters in the already-stamped pile, and after adding the 20 newly stamped letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30. Let's denote the initial number of letters in the already-stamped pile as \( x \). Therefore, we have:

\[
x + 20 = 30
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
x = 30 - 20 = 10
\]

So, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.
2. Julia's husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she used 3 spoons from the total.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought is \( \boxed{10} \)."

\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has to find the total number of friends they have together:
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Amy has} + \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 70 + 50 = 120 \]

So, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item based on the given information.

1. **Cost of a pepper**: Given as $15.
2. **Cost of a watermelon**: Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, the cost of a watermelon is:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of an orange**: An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so the cost of an orange is:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

1. **Cost of 4 watermelons**: 
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. So, the number of elves left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves left:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Mark completed in each test and then find out how many he left incomplete.

### First Test:
- **Total questions**: 75
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 8 hours

First, calculate how many questions Mark could complete in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Questions completed} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{questions/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 40 \, \text{questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions and Mark completed 40 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

### Second Test:
- **Total questions**: 100
- **Rate**: 5 questions per hour
- **Time allowed**: 6 hours

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the number of blue gumballs. According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

The relationship can be expressed with the following equation:
\[ P = 4 \times (\text{number of blue gumballs}) + 22 \]

Substituting the number of blue gumballs (12) into the equation:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]

Finally, add the numbers together:
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \( 70 \)."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- Since \( B = 2Q \),
- And \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

Now substitute \( W \) and \( B \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( \boxed{400} \)."

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths required. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by for bicycles, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by for tricycles, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by for a unicycle, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the total hours for each type of class and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours for the classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- So, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours in class.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours per week.

Next, let's calculate the hours for the classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, Kimo has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- So, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in class.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week, the total for these days is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) hours per week.

Now, let's find the total hours per week:
- The total hours per week is \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, the total hours for the semester is:
- \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"First, let's convert all measurements to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- Each roll is 4 inches long. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet long.
- Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long, so each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- For the rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- For the chocolate croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- For the baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is 280 feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly requirement: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly requirement: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) bananas

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly requirement: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) bananas

Now, we add the total bananas required for each type of ape over the 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long and Blake runs back and forth 15 times, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is a round trip of 80 yards, and she does this 34 times. So, the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards. Since Blake runs more, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he bought and then add them together.

   - Each notebook costs $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the rim of bond paper:**
   - The rim of bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for the rim of bond paper = $20.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 6 \text{ (pens)} + 8 \text{ (notebooks)} + 20 \text{ (rim of bond paper)} = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"To determine how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, Finn watches 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 of these tadpoles come out from under a lily pad. This means the number of tadpoles he can see increases by 6.
3. After that, 2 of the tadpoles hide under a rock. This means the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2.

Let's calculate the number of tadpoles Finn can see now:

- Initially, he sees 11 tadpoles.
- After 6 more come out, he sees \(11 + 6 = 17\) tadpoles.
- Then, 2 hide under a rock, so he sees \(17 - 2 = 15\) tadpoles.

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:

15"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Depth on Monday:**
   The tank's depth on Monday is 17 feet.

2. **Depth on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. So, we add 7 feet to the Monday depth:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is **16 feet**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

**Anakin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

**Locsin's Catch:**
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin, so \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin, so \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin, so \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Total for Locsin:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

**Total Fish Caught by Both:**
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% every two months.

1. **Initial Price**: $20

2. **Price Increase Calculation**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months. A 20% increase means the new price is 120% of the previous price.
   - In 36 months, there are 18 two-month periods (since \(36 \div 2 = 18\)).

3. **Formula for Compound Increase**:
   - The formula to calculate the final price after multiple periods of compound increase is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}}
     \]
   - Here, the increase rate is 20%, or 0.20, and the number of periods is 18.

4. **Substitute the Values**:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Power**:
   - First, calculate \(1.20^{18}\):
     \[
     1.20^{18} \approx 39.366
     \]

6. **Final Price Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the red cars:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.

2. **Determine the cost of the action figures:**
   - We are given that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - We also know that the doll costs the same as one red car, which is $4.
   - Therefore, 3 action figures cost $4.
   - So, one action figure costs \(\frac{4}{3}\) dollars. However, we are given that the action figure costs $5, so we will use this information directly.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the toys:**
   - There are 5 red cars, each costing $4.
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There are 3 action figures, each costing $5.
     \[
     \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - There is 1 doll, which costs the same as 3 action figures, or $4.
     \[
     \text{Cost of the doll} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total cost of all the toys:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is \(\boxed{39}\) dollars."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the income she would lose by doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the income lost by doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
   - Therefore, the income lost is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. The cost of hiring an accountant is $90.

3. Compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the income lost:
   - Income lost by doing taxes herself: $105
   - Cost of hiring an accountant: $90
   - The difference is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Next, we add these costs together to find the total expenditure:
\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's break it down step by step:
\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]
\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]
\[
1321 + 157 = 1478
\]
\[
1478 + 74 = 1552
\]
\[
1552 + 102 = 1654
\]

The total cost of the items is €1654. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by:
\[
1654 - 1500 = 154
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she requires to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's define the current ages of Seth and Brooke using variables. Let Brooke's current age be \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. We can write this as:

\[
(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
\]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( B \):

\[
3B = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( B \):

\[
B = 8
\]

Since Brooke is 8 years old, Seth, who is twice as old as Brooke, is:

\[
2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to peel one potato. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 1.5 \text{ minutes per potato} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Billy to cut one potato. It takes him about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds per potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the cutting time into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

"First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. 

Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14
\]
Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:
\[
14 + 5 = 19
\]
So, two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. Therefore, Mark's current age is:
\[
19 + 2 = 21
\]

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is currently 21 years old, Jean's age is:
\[
21 + 2 = 23

Therefore, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Slower Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner runs in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner runs in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner runs in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.25 \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

So, they both picked 30 apples."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Determine the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats and the straw each rat gets:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 90 pieces.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\) rats.

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\) rats.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount Mandy owes after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%.

1. **Initial Amount**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

We will calculate the amount owed each month, including the interest.

**After 1st Month:**
- Interest for 1st month: $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1st month: $100 + $2 = $102

**After 2nd Month:**
- Interest for 2nd month: $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2nd month: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**After 3rd Month:**
- Interest for 3rd month: $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3rd month: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat the trader bought and sold.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of buying the wheat is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost of transporting the wheat is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The revenue from selling the wheat is \( 30x \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we can write the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation: \( 8x = 400 \).
   - Divide both sides by 8: \( x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \).

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Total cost of rides} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute.

First, we know John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. So, to find the total number of peaches collected, we multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Therefore, the total number of peaches John collects is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly need into a daily need.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly need is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per dozen cups is $4800 / 20 = $240.

4. **Calculate the cost per cup:**
   - Since one dozen equals 12 cups, the cost per cup is $240 / 12 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before she starts mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars (from her savings and babysitting).

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( 4 \) red chickens.

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(s\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{s} \]

Here, the distance \(d\) is 15 miles and the speed \(s\) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days was 500.

Let's denote the number of customers on the third day as \(x\).

The total number of customers over the three days can be expressed as:
\[100 + 150 + x = 500\]

Now, we can solve for \(x\):
\[250 + x = 500\]
\[x = 500 - 250\]
\[x = 250\]

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of dahlias in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7
Number of dahlias = 4 + 7
Number of dahlias = 11

Now, to find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total number of flowers = 4 + 11
Total number of flowers = 15

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we need to find their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri scored 10 more than this: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
- Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

Add these points together to find the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's points can be found by subtracting the points scored by the other three students from the total:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is \(10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is \(5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

Now, we add the time spent on both types of puzzles:
- Total time spent = time on crossword puzzles + time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = \(30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}\).

So, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising.

First, calculate a third of $15000:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising in the second year.

Now, add the amounts spent over the two years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add those costs together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is \( \boxed{180} \) dollars."
"First, let's determine the number of days it takes to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. According to the problem, it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days to travel by bus, the travel time by car is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total travel time for the round trip. Andrew will travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. Therefore, the total travel time is the sum of the days taken for each leg of the trip:

\[ 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Let's break down the cost step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:

\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, Chad still owes \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate their combined rate:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

**Final Answer:**
1"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: 120

2. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two months**: 30% of 120
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest after two months.

3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**: 
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]

4. **Watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks**: 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest after two weeks.

5. **Remaining watermelons after harvesting**: 
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**
   Each car costs $20,000, and Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   The tax rate is 10%, so we need to find 10% of $240,000.
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total registration cost:**
   The registration cost per car is $1,000, and there are 12 cars.

"To find the total number of insects in the garden, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bugs in the garden.
2. Add the number of bugs to the number of ants to get the total number of insects.

Given that there are 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

Number of bugs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25\)

Now, we add the number of bugs to the number of ants to find the total number of insects:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs = 50 + 25 = 75

So, the total number of insects in the garden is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many penguins jump in the ocean. Since one-third of the 36 penguins jump in the ocean, we calculate:

"To solve this problem, we need to understand how Ram can use the empty pens to make new pens. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle**: After using these 25 pens, he can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]
3. **Second Cycle**: Now, he has 5 new pens plus the 5 empty pens from the first 25 pens, making a total of 10 pens. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 10 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ new pens}
   \]
4. **Third Cycle**: Now, he has 2 new pens plus the 5 empty pens from the previous 10 pens, making a total of 7 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 7 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
5. **Fourth Cycle**: Now, he has 1 new pen plus the 5 empty pens from the previous 7 pens, making a total of 6 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 6 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
6. **Fifth Cycle**: Now, he has 1 new pen plus the 5 empty pens from the previous 6 pens, making a total of 6 pens. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 6 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
7. **Final Count**: After the fifth cycle, he has 1 new pen plus the 5 empty pens from the previous 6 pens, making a total of 6 pens. He can no longer make any new pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new pen, and he only has 1 pen left.

Adding all the pens together, we get:
\[
25 \text{ (initial pens)} + 5 \text{ (first cycle)} + 2 \text{ (second cycle)} + 1 \text{ (third cycle)} + 1 \text{ (fourth cycle)} + 1 \text{ (fifth cycle)} = 35

"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C from the remaining students after exits A and B.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Number of students who went out through exit A:**
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**

"First, let's determine how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54 \]

Solving for Robert's candies:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know Robert has 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

John has 54 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ 21 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.
3. If both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count all the books each of them reads.

- Dolly will read her 2 books plus Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.
- Pandora will read her 1 book plus Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, we add the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora:

- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.

So, collectively, they read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's determine how many pen pals Mike is still corresponding with after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2, so he is now corresponding with:

\[5 - 2 = 3\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \times 2 = 6\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 6 letters a week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so the total number of pages he writes in a week is:

\[6 \times 5 = 30\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing a week is:

\[30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his 15-minute calls with his boss each day. Since there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes spent on these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for other calls:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the monthly plan of 1000 minutes to find out how many minutes are left:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken.
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 9 + x - 2
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin ended up with 27 fries.
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   \[
   x = 27 - 7
   \]
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( \boxed{7} \)."
"To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works.
2. Determine the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the 10% discount.
4. Calculate the final amount Jean paid.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works.**

The makeup artist works 6 hours each day and needs it done 4 times a week. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

Total hours per week = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week
Total hours for 5 weeks = 24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

**Step 2: Determine the total cost before the discount.**

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

Total cost before discount = 120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

**Step 3: Apply the 10% discount.**

A 10% discount means Jean pays 90% of the total cost.

Discounted cost = $30,000 * 0.90 = $27,000

**Step 4: Calculate the final amount Jean paid.**

The final amount Jean paid is $27,000.

"First, let's determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate each day.

**Monday:**
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

**Tuesday:**
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

**Total cookies eaten by Sue:**
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

**Total cookies eaten by her sister:**
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:

**Calories consumed by Sue:**
\[ 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

**Calories consumed by her sister:**
\[ 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:

\[ 9200 \text{ calories} - 3600 \text{ calories} = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood. Therefore, the weight of the wood eaten by the termites is:

\[ 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate, we subtract the weight of the eaten wood from the original weight:

Total cost for tomato seeds = $800

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30

Total cost for celery seeds = Number of celery seed packets × Cost per packet
Total cost for celery seeds = 80 × $30
Total cost for celery seeds = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:
Total amount of money used = Total cost for tomato seeds + Total cost for celery seeds
Total amount of money used = $800 + $2400
Total amount of money used = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes:

- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30

Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the large holes:

- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15

Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, let's add the total time for both small and large holes:

Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total time in hours = 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

4 hours"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 40.

Explanation:
- Currently, the sum of their ages is 20.
- In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.
- Therefore, the total additional years added to their current sum of ages is \(10 + 10 = 20\).
- So, the new sum of their ages will be \(20 + 20 = 40\).

Final numerical answer:
40"
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables. Let \( S \) be Sam's current age and \( R \) be Ruby's current age.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \)

First, substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- Therefore, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation for the number of spots on a mamba:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

\[
\frac{39}{3} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
\]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of each necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length occupied by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Remaining length for sterling silver beads = \( 25 - 8 = 17 \) inches.

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17}{0.25} \).

4. **Perform the division:**

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by all three.

First, let's calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person:

- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

- The 3 rows of 8 stars give us \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- The 2 rows of 6 stars give us \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Adding these together, we get \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars from the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. So, the number of stars that are in the 5-star rows is \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars.

To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the 40 stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

**Final Answer:**
8"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since the car in the slow lane is traveling at 30 miles per hour and the distance is the same (480 miles), we can calculate the time it took for the slow lane car to travel the same distance:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16 \text{ hours}} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so:
\[ 5 \text{ bars/packet} \times 8 \text{ packets} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

Each of the 4 adults gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 remaining chocolate bars need to be shared equally among them. So, we divide the 16 bars by 8 children:
\[ 16 \text{ bars} \div 8 \text{ children} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer:**
Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a half-hour break. The total time from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours. Subtracting the half-hour break, she works for:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Susan earns:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round. The condition is that they must have over 20 points to get the extra point.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, and his total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{83}

"First, let's determine the ages of the sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, so he washes 4 oranges.

Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will bought 15 oranges in total. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
3"
"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day:

- **Pushups**: On the first day, he does 100 pushups. On the second day, he does 20 more than on the first day, so:
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pushups}
  \]

- **Squats**: On the first day, he does 50 squats. On the second day, he does 10 fewer than on the first day, so:
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40 \text{ squats}
  \]

- **Dumbbell presses**: On the first day, he does 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he doubles the number, so:
  \[
  20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dumbbell presses}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

- **Total pushups**:
  \[
  100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \text{ pushups}
  \]

- **Total squats**:
  \[
  50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \text{ squats}
  \]

- **Total dumbbell presses**:
  \[
  20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \text{ dumbbell presses}
  \]

Finally, we sum up all the activities to get the total count:
\[
220 \text{ pushups} + 90 \text{ squats} + 60 \text{ dumbbell presses} = 370
\]

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is:
\[

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily rice consumption for the household:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - Each person eats rice at lunch and dinner, so each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \, \text{kg}\) per day.
   - There are 5 members in the household, so the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg} \times 5 = 2 \, \text{kg}\).

2. **Calculate the weekly rice consumption for the household:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg} \times 7 = 14 \, \text{kg}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - Divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption: \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Friday.

- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Adding these together:

\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold a total of 65 crates from Tuesday to Friday.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.
2. **Bids by Others**: There are 3 other people who each bid once. Since the bids rise by $50 each time, the bids by the other people are:
   - First other person: $200 + $50 = $250
   - Second other person: $250 + $50 = $300
   - Third other person: $300 + $50 = $350
3. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the other three people, so her bids are:
   - After the first other person: $300
   - After the second other person: $350
   - After the third other person: $400

4. **Total Cost**: The total cost is the sum of all the bids Carmen makes, including the initial bid and the three subsequent bids:
   \[
   200 + 300 + 350 + 400
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   \[
   200 + 300 = 500
   \]
   \[
   500 + 350 = 850
   \]
   \[
   850 + 400 = 1250

Therefore, the total cost of the desk to Carmen is \(\boxed{1250}\) dollars."
"To find out how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to calculate the cost based on the miles driven and the bonus given.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven in a year:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, which is 60 miles each day.
   - He works 5 days a week and the service operates for 50 weeks a year.
   - Therefore, the total miles driven in a year is \(60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year}\).

2. **Calculate the cost based on the miles driven:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile.
   - Therefore, the cost for the miles driven is \(15000 \text{ miles} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30000\).

3. **Calculate the total bonus given in a year:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total bonus for the year is \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800\).

4. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - The total annual cost is the sum of the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is \(\$30000 + \$1800 = \$31800\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{31800}

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can accommodate two pages: one on the front and one on the back.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of pages per piece of paper**: Each piece of paper, when folded, can print 2 pages (one on the front and one on the back).

2. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: Since the tabloid has 32 pages, and each piece of paper can print 2 pages, we divide the total number of pages by 2.
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 16 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of books**: 250
2. **Books sold this year**: 45
3. **Books remaining unsold**: 50

First, we need to find out how many books have been sold in total so far. Since there are 50 unsold books, the number of books sold so far is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, we know that the number of books sold this year is 45. Let's denote the number of books sold in the first year as \( x \) and the number of books sold in the second year as \( y \). According to the problem, the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year:
\[ x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and current years from the total books sold so far:
\[ y = 200 - (x + 45) = 200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20. Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour.
So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:
Watson works 5 days a week.
So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$100/\text{day} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:
\[ \$500/\text{week} + \$300/\text{week} = \$800/\text{week} \]

Now, let's determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks.
So, Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$800/\text{week} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3200 \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16 of them, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that 40 loaves are sold in the morning, leaving:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

loaves unsold after the morning.

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we need to find half of the 20 loaves that are left:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening combined} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same as Joey in one week), we can calculate the total weeks for Sandy to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:

- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

Now, to find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

\[13 \times 7 = 91\]

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"To find out how old Trent is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. So, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah was \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - Therefore, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Then, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. The problem states that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
\]

This means that 2 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. Therefore, the number of people who couldn't come due to illness but did not have previous commitments is:

\[
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come (both due to illness and previous commitments) from the total number of people invited:

\[
24 - 8 = 16 \text{ people}
\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. He added these 20 marbles to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.
4. Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Solomon has. This is the sum of the marbles he originally had, the marbles he bought, and the marbles his father gave him:
   \[
   50 + 20 + 8 = 78
   \]
5. Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
   \[
   78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kg."

"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can calculate the number of electric poles as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. If \( W = 45 \), then we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate how many people left after an hour. Since \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means that 10 people left, so the number of people remaining at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Let's denote the number of women who stayed as \( W \). The total number of people who stayed is the sum of the men and women who stayed:
\[ 22 \text{ men} + W \text{ women} = 30 \text{ people} \]

From this equation, we can solve for \( W \):
\[ W = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

So, the number of women who are left at the party is:

"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find out how much a pen costs. The problem states that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. Since the magazine costs $2, we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"First, let's determine how many pencils are in the boxes that Jam has. We know Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since Jam has three boxes and 24 pencils in total, we can find out how many pencils are in each box by dividing the total number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we need to find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so the total number of pencils is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We do this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{9}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Adding 15 milliliters of cream will make the coffee:
   \[
   15 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since 1 new record requires 2 old records, 7 new records would require:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be found by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we need to determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[
\text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Now, we can calculate the total monthly salary paid to all the junior programmers:

\[
\text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Similarly, we can calculate the total monthly salary paid to all the senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the total salaries of the junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[ \text{Amount taken off by the coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount the customer paid after applying the reward and the coupon.

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs.

**Net pay comparison:**
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year.

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial value} = 8 \times 8 = \$64
   \]

2. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 64 \times 0.50 = \$32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 64 + 32 = \$96
   \]

3. In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 96 \times 0.25 = \$24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 96 - 24 = \$72
   \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is \(\$72\)."
"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Since the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the larger groups, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students in the class is 200, and the class is split into three groups. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \), we get:
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, there are 20 cows and 40 chickens. Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times C + 2 \times H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Josh starts by juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show is 4 weeks away, so by the end of the fourth week, he will have added 4 balls in total (1 ball per week for 4 weeks).

So, the number of balls Josh can juggle by the end of the fourth week is:
\[ 3 \text{ (initial balls)} + 4 \text{ (balls added over 4 weeks)} = 7 \text{ balls} \]

4. During the performance, Josh drops 3 balls. Since 2 of them are caught and 1 is lost, he is left with:
\[ 7 \text{ (initial balls)} - 3 \text{ (dropped balls)} = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, Josh starts juggling with 4 balls."
"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. Therefore, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs \(50 + 10 = 60\) pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, the red bird weighs \(50 - 20 = 30\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself. The weights of the animals are:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

Adding these weights together, we get:
\[50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}\]

Including the weight of the container, which is 20 pounds, the total weight is:
\[240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits that her friend gave her. So, she received \(2 \times 24 = 48\) new baby outfits.
3. Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Now, let's add up all the baby outfits Laurel has:

- Outfits from her friend: 24
- Outfits from her baby shower: 48
- Outfits from her mom: 15

Total number of outfits = \(24 + 48 + 15\)

Now, let's do the addition:

\[24 + 48 = 72\]
\[72 + 15 = 87\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{87}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many meters Tyson would run each day if he followed his coach's advice. Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters. 

To find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 5000 meters:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Adding this to his current daily distance:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson would run 6000 meters each day if he followed his coach's advice.

Next, we need to determine the total distance Tyson would cover in June if he trained for the entire month. June typically has 30 days.

To find the total distance for the month:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[
180,000 \text{ meters}

"First, let's determine the cost of each juice box:

- Juice Box A costs $4.
- Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it costs \(4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.
- Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it costs \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

\[11 - 9 = 2\]

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B. 

Final numerical answer:
\[2\]"
"To find the total number of legs from the tables, we need to calculate the legs from each type of table separately and then add them together.

First, we calculate the legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables together:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we have:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are taken out of the total 36 cookies each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

Finally, to find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies taken by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.

Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the discount amount. The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $60:
\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the daily earnings from tractors were:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

- They now sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the daily earnings from silos are:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in daily earnings from tractors to silos. The formula to find the percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses and then multiply by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly cost of food = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Treats cost $20 per month.**
3. **Medicine costs $100 per month.**

Now, add up the monthly costs:
- Monthly cost of food = $100
- Monthly cost of treats = $20
- Monthly cost of medicine = $100

Total monthly cost = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220

To find the yearly cost, multiply the monthly cost by 12:
- Yearly cost = $220/month * 12 months/year = $2640

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find out how many hours all of Peyton's after-work activities will take, let's break down each activity and calculate the total time step by step.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday:**
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Cooking Class on Tuesday:**
   - Duration: 3 times the yoga class
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Cheese-Tasting Event on Wednesday:**

"First, let's determine how many plant pots April needs for the roses. Since they need twice as many pots for the roses as for the daisies, and they need 30 pots for the daisies, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ pots for the roses} \]

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ pots} \]

April had already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:

So, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Andrea spent and gave away.
2. Subtract the total amount spent and given away from the initial amount of money she had.

First, let's calculate the total amount Andrea spent and gave away:
- She spent $11 on a sweater.
- She gave her brother $4.

So, the total amount spent and given away is:
\[ 11 + 4 = 15 \]

Andrea initially had $36. To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent and given away from her initial amount:

"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: 6 hours
2. **Swimming**: Half the time spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. **Watching shows**: 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time by \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add her savings and her earnings from both jobs to find out how much money she has in total:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars (initial savings)} + 200 \, \text{dollars (first job)} + 75 \, \text{dollars (second job)} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the height of each tree step by step.

1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. Therefore, the height of the second tree is:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. First, we find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. The height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Morgan and friends} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

Billy bought 4 pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(100 + 75 - 50 = 125\) miles (since it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's determine how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed.

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Erin has now.
2. Calculate how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Sara has scored 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points are three times Sara's points:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points. We do this by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, the number of points Erin had before is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + (20% of $20) = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 1/4 * 44 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of all costs = Cost of picture frames + Cost of pins + Cost of cords.
   - Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."

\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

So, if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper, the total cost would be $320."
"Let's break down the sales day by day:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is \(50 \times 2 = 100\).

"To find out how much milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Mary has 30 sheep in total.
2. Half of the sheep produce 1 kg of milk each day.
3. The other half produce 2 kg of milk each day.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in each group:
- Half of 30 sheep is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

Next, we calculate the total milk produced by each group:
- The 15 sheep that produce 1 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 1 = 15 \) kg of milk.
- The other 15 sheep that produce 2 kg of milk each day will produce \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) kg of milk.

Finally, we add the milk produced by both groups to get the total daily milk collection:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make. Since the interest is simple (assuming it's not compound, as the problem doesn't specify otherwise), we can use the simple interest formula to find the total amount to be paid back and then divide it by the number of months.

The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% or 0.10
- Time (T) = 5 months (which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) years, but since the rate is given as an annual rate, we can use 5 months directly for simplicity in this context)

First, calculate the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount to be paid back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Axel has 80 gold pesos. Since Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos to find the overall total.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is **350**."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. Millie spends $18 on supplies. Therefore, her profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total time:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had \(\boxed{32}\) hectares of land."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The problem states that the choir decides to perform with just its female members. Therefore, initially, 26 girls are planning to perform.

However, on the day of the performance, half of the people performing can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

This means the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[ \text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Let's do the addition step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total of the scores is 400. Now, we divide this total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) dollars.

Now, add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: $30.
- Dasha's total cost with individual tickets: $36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's find the total parts of the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

So, each part of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Now, we need to find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 \times (1 - 0.20) = 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable package, which is $60 per month. The amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package and getting the streaming services is:

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the year.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.**

The builder works 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year.
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the year.**

The builder earns $50 every day.
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, we need to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe calls for 3 cups.
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\).

For the milk:
- Normal recipe calls for 1 cup.
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\).

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\).

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\).

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4\).

**Final Answer: 4**"
"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
- The two zebras with 17 stripes each contribute \( 2 \times 17 = 34 \) stripes.
- The zebra with 36 stripes contributes 36 stripes.
- The zebra with 18 stripes contributes 18 stripes.

So, the total number of stripes is:
\[ 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 5 zebras in total. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{88}{5} = 17.6 \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[ 17.6 \]"
"To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. There are 20 people in total.
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of meat} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of cheese} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of Corns Initially:**
   There is twice as much corn as cannolis. So, the number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Additional Cannolis:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis. So, the new total number of cannolis is:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100
   \]

4. **Additional Corns:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. So, the number of additional corns is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, the new total number of corns is:
   \[
   80 + 20 = 100
   \]

5. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   100 + 100 = 200
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{200}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He completed half of his steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) steps.
3. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
4. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

First, let's calculate the total steps he had completed before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000

Total steps before the jog: \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \)

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he had taken before the jog plus the steps from the jog should equal 10,000 steps.

Let \( x \) be the number of steps he took during his jog. Then:
\[ 6,000 + x = 10,000 \]

To find \( x \):
\[ x = 10,000 - 6,000 \]
\[ x = 4,000 \]

So, Elliott took 4,000 steps during his jog.

**Final Answer:**
4,000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, the total time he has before he needs to leave is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can now calculate how many minutes early he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for May = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 = 24000
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for June = Number of employees × Payment per employee per hour × Hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Total payment for June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40 = 18000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   \[
   \text{Total payment for May and June} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June} = 24000 + 18000 = 42000

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ \$10 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. Since it's worth twice the amount of the first pack, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

So, the second pack of fireworks costs $800.

Next, we find the total cost of the fireworks before the discount by adding the cost of the first pack, the second pack, and the finale firework:

\[ 400 + 800 + 150 = 1350 \]

Now, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of $1350:

\[ 1350 \times 0.80 = 1080 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1080} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Convert the total number of cookies into dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it gives us the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 5% of the more dangerous candles. Since the problem does not specify the percentage of candles that explode, we can only use the information given about the wet dog smell.

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, we calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 50,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

Since the problem does not provide the percentage of candles that explode or any additional information to determine the overlap between the candles that smell like wet dog and the candles that explode, we can only conclude that the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is not specified by the given data.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the final numerical answer for the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

This answer assumes there is no additional information provided about the overlap between the two conditions (smelling like wet dog and exploding)."
"First, let's calculate the discount price for each blouse. Since the blouses are on a 30% off rack, we need to find 30% of the regular price of $20.

The discount amount per blouse is:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discounted price per blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so the total cost for 4 blouses is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, for Joanne's sister:
- She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:
\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we need to determine the elevation of the ledge where Stanley's comb landed. Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. So, the elevation of the ledge is:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of the comb, we subtract Oliver's current elevation from the elevation of the comb:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave $4000, the second bank gave:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
3. After the boats took away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is \(50 - 20 = 30\).
4. Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).
5. After 18 cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

So, the final number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**

   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112

The total cost for 2 years of the service is **\$256**."
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations to find out how much he saved on each type of jeans.

Let \( S_{\text{jogger}} \) be the savings from the jogger jeans and \( S_{\text{tattered}} \) be the savings from the tattered jeans. We know:
\[ S_{\text{jogger}} + S_{\text{tattered}} = 6 \]
\[ S_{\text{jogger}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ S_{\text{tattered}} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The original price of the jogger jeans is the sale price plus the savings from the jogger jeans:
\[ \text{Original price of jogger jeans} = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
\[ 24 - 28 = -4 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The absolute difference is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each bird feeder Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has:
- 3 homemade bird feeders.
- 3 store-bought bird feeders.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds per feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds per feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   - The ticket costs $100.

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   - He has $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   - Total money = Cost of ticket + Spending cash
   - Total money = $100 + $50 = $150

4. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card
   - Number of cards sold = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

5. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - Number of cards sold = 2/3 of \( x \)
   - We know the number of cards sold is 100.
   - 2/3 of \( x \) = 100
   - \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \)

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared was \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the 36 guests who were initially supposed to have one hotdog got one.
   - So, 36 hotdogs were used for these 36 guests.
   - This leaves \( 54 - 36 = 18 \) hotdogs for the additional 4 guests and for the second hotdog for the first 18 guests.
   - The first 18 guests each wanted a second hotdog, so they need 18 more hotdogs.
   - Since only 18 hotdogs are left, all 18 guests who were supposed to have a second hotdog will get one.
   - This means the 4 additional guests who showed up will not get a second hotdog.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ 13 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's determine how much gas each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Amount left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to find out how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."

"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, we can calculate the time for Bernadette's drive as follows:

\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes, or simply 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves to arrive 1 minute before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - After 1 hour: \(40 + 5 = 45\) degrees
   - After 2 hours: \(45 + 5 = 50\) degrees
   - After 3 hours: \(50 + 5 = 55\) degrees

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes it is open.
   - Since the window is open for 30 minutes, we calculate the cooling effect as follows:
     - 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes.
     - So, the cooling effect is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

4. **Final Temperature Calculation**: Subtract the cooling effect from the temperature after baking.
   - Final temperature: \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is equal to:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the total cost of the hay from the amount of money he has:
\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out \(\boxed{2}\) trays."

So, Joey now has 240 points.

Next, let's calculate Marcy's new total points after her turn. Marcy originally has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy now has 235 points.

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new total from Joey's new total.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"To find the salesman's profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers and then subtract the cost of purchasing the case.

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the costs step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost if you buy the super ticket:
- The super ticket costs $20.
- With the super ticket, you get a popcorn and a soda for an extra $1.
- Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

Next, let's calculate the cost if you don't buy the super ticket:
- The regular movie ticket costs $12.
- You buy a popcorn and a soda at regular price.
- The soda costs $3.
- Let \( P \) be the regular price of the popcorn.
- Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost without the super ticket is $2 less than the cost with the super ticket:
\[ 21 = 15 + P + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 17 + P \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 21 - 17 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days.
2. Add the amounts together to get the total.

First, let's calculate the number of apples each person eats in 30 days:
- Each person eats 4 apples a day.
- In 30 days, each person eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).

Now, let's add the amounts together:
- Marin eats 120 apples.

- Together, they eat \(120 + 120 = 240 \text{ apples}\).

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, so the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ 2 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} \times 2 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ 10 \times 32 \text{ cubic feet} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{320 \text{ cubic feet}}{2 \text{ cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ 160 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1920 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies. These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).
3. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20.

2. **Calculate the total number of puppies with spots:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7.

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**
   - The percentage is given by the formula: \(\frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \times 100\).
   - Plugging in the numbers: \(\frac{7}{20} \times 100\).

4. **Perform the division and multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{7}{20} = 0.35\).
   - \(0.35 \times 100 = 35\).

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is **35%**."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Next, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[ 3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles each week.

**Cans:**
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:
  \[
  3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Bottles:**
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Total weekly earnings:**
- Adding the earnings from cans and bottles:
  \[
  6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Total earnings in a four-week month:**
- Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total earnings are:
  \[
  21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
  \]

Therefore, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Therefore, Toni has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to find out how many plants Shondra has. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants, Shondra has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to last place (100th place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she is now in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 + 3 = 101\). Again, since she can't be in a position higher than 100, we adjust this to 100th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(100 - 1 = 99\). So, she is now in 99th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 99th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards she has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.

The total cost before the discount is:

After the $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

A 10 percent discount on $10 is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforter per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of laundry item for 80 rooms:

- **Total sheets**: \(2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}\)
- **Total comforters**: \(1 \text{ comforter/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 80 \text{ comforters}\)
- **Total pillow cases**: \(4 \text{ pillow cases/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 320 \text{ pillow cases}\)
- **Total towels**: \(8 \text{ towels/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 640 \text{ towels}\)

Finally, we add up all the pieces of laundry:

\[160 \text{ sheets} + 80 \text{ comforters} + 320 \text{ pillow cases} + 640 \text{ towels} = 1200 \text{ pieces of laundry}\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**: He gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since 1 pair equals 2 shoes, 5 pairs equal 10 shoes.
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday**: He gains 15 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   210 + (15 \times 2) = 210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes received on Friday**: He gains 30 pairs of shoes.
   \[
   240 + (30 \times 2) = 240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday**: He gets rid of 180 shoes.

"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year. There are 30 students, and each student started with 10 pencils.

\[ \text{Total pencils at the start} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, we need to find out how many pencils were used and how many were left.

\[ \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

\[ \text{Pencils left after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, we need to find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

\[ \text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

Each remora is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) feet long.

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Here, the ""Part"" is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot), and the ""Whole"" is the shark's body length (10 feet):

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length."

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80

"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both.

The total number of kids in the class is 32. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees to the number of tour guides.

First, calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend.

The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500. Since it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, we need to find 20% of $1500 and add it to the normal price.

20% of $1500 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the cost of the hotel per day during the busy weekend is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. The cost of each plane ticket is $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

So, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs:

- Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
songs.

- Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final numerical answer:
40"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240

So, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total miles James runs in a week:

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days, so:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week. Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the total hours by dividing the total miles by his speed:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats consumed by one horse in one day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, one horse eats:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of oats consumed by all four horses in one day. Since there are four horses, the total consumption is:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats are consumed by the horses over five days. This is calculated as:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats. This is calculated by dividing the total pounds of oats needed by the pounds per bag:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

   - Total cost before discounts: \( 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \) dollars.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" buying 2 packs means she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Cost after the sale: \( 4.00 \) dollars (for 2 packs).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price: \( 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors: \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) razors.

5. **Determine the cost per razor:**
   - Total cost after all discounts: $2.00.
   - Number of razors: 8.
   - Cost per razor: \( \frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25 \) dollars.

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - 1 dollar = 100 cents.
   - \( 0.25 \) dollars = \( 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \) cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor is **25 cents**."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid, the height of the pyramid would be the height of the shortest cheerleader since they are stacked on top of each other, and the shortest one is at the top.

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

This means that in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is right now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Angela is 38 years old."
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for both morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost for morning rides: $84
- Total cost for afternoon rides: $28
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, we add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one greek orange pie needs three oranges:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests for which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (which includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each of them used and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how much yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn. So we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[ \boxed{273} \]"
"To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, let's break down the problem step by step.

"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of these packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost for all four packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented by the equation:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

The final numerical answer is:

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as possible since they are cheaper.

First, calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, he can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood. Each piece of 2 x 4 wood yields 200 sticks, so:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of trips she makes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost of the individual trips and the cost of the bus pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo.

For the farm:
\[ 30 \text{ cows} + 10 \text{ sheep} = 40 \text{ animals} \]

For the zoo:
\[ 60 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ sheep} = 80 \text{ animals} \]

\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

So, the total number of animals in the farm and the zoo combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and using the information given.

Let:
- \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought.
- \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. We are also given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

So, we can write the following equations based on the information:
\[ 4S_o = 12 \]
\[ 4S_p = 4 \]

Now, we solve these equations for \( S_o \) and \( S_p \).

1. Solving for \( S_o \):
\[ 4S_o = 12 \]
\[ S_o = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ S_o = 3 \]

2. Solving for \( S_p \):
\[ 4S_p = 4 \]
\[ S_p = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ S_p = 1 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ S_o + S_p = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since burning 3500 calories results in a loss of 1 pound, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal:**
   Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Next, let's calculate her new weekly consumption after adding the device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kilowatt-hours is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine how long it would take one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house, which is 10 days.

Now, if one person takes 10 days to paint a whole house, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to do the same job. Since 5 people are working together, they can paint the house 5 times faster than one person.

So, if one person takes 10 days, 5 people would take:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since we need the answer in hours and there are 24 hours in a day, we convert 2 days into hours:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the following equation to find the number of chairs Ophelia has:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to determine the number of sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. We sum the number of sofas and chairs for both Ophelia and Jenna:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is:

\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

Total cost - Cost of CD = Cost of headphone set
$48 - $4 = $44

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, we need to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have had the full $48 to spend on CDs.

Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:

$48 ÷ $4 = 12

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, the total hours for this week is:
   \[
   1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[
24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   - There are initially 48 passengers on the bus.

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - The number of passengers getting on the bus is 5 times the number who got off.
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40
     \]
   - After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
     \[
     48 - 8 + 40 = 80
     \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - The number of passengers getting on the bus is 3 times fewer than the number who got off at the first stop.
     \[
     \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33
     \]
     Since the number of passengers must be a whole number, we assume it is 13 (as typically fractional passengers are not considered in such problems).
   - After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
     \[
     80 - 21 + 13 = 72
     \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

Given that the computer costs $1,100, the printer costs:
\[ 1,100 - 400 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ 1,100 + 700 = 1,800 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. Therefore, the cost of the 2 monitors is:
\[ 2,400 - 1,800 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of one monitor is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.

Therefore, each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells."
"First, we determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Original number of candies George had} - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for the original number of candies George had:

\[ \text{Original number of candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Nick had as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's calculate the thickness of each book step by step.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. So, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \, \text{mm} - 5 \, \text{mm} = 45 \, \text{mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. So, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \, \text{mm} = 62 \, \text{mm}
   \]

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books to find the total thickness:
\[
31 \, \text{mm} + 50 \, \text{mm} + 45 \, \text{mm} + 62 \, \text{mm} = 188 \, \text{mm}
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is:

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

4. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, the daily savings in the second half = \( 2x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down her earnings into two parts: the commission from the first $1000 in sales and the commission from the sales over $1000.

1. **Commission from the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Calculation: \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \)

2. **Commission from the sales over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \).
   - Commission rate for the sales over $1000 is 10%.
   - Calculation: \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \)

3. **Total commission:**
   - Add the two amounts together: \( 300 + 150 = 450 \)

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450."
"First, let's calculate how many water bottles Bill already has. He has 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he starts with is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles Bill expects to give out. He has 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy. We subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water.

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns in a week.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

"To find the total cost of your lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

1. The cost of the foot-long fish sub is given as $40.
2. The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
   Therefore, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs $120.

3. To find the total cost of your lunch, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
   \[
   40 + 120 = 160
   \]

So, the total cost of your lunch today is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"First, let's determine how many buttons had four holes. We know there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have two holes. So, the number of buttons with four holes is:

\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes. Since there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes. Since there are 14 buttons with 4 holes each:

\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:

\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

\[ 70 \]"
"First, let's find the size of Zack's locker. Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we calculate:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the size of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups. Since Octavia drinks half of the recommended amount, she drinks:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks:

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the number of cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups."
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add them together.

- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to get the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = number of hamsters + number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Therefore, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents."
"First, let's determine the weight of each person:

1. Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we find the total weight of the three friends by adding their individual weights:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3):
\[
\frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[
180 \text{ pounds}

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. So, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since there are 7 nights in a week and she read for 15 minutes each night, the total reading time for the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute by dividing 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of minutes she read by the number of pages per minute:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is the sum of the pages read in the first week and the second week:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, let's calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find out how many sandwiches were eaten in total:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Since they started with 12 sandwiches, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, in 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old, and we can write the equation:
  \[
  51 = 3(N + 7)
  \]

Now, we solve for \( N \):
\[
51 = 3(N + 7)
\]
\[
51 = 3N + 21
\]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[
30 = 3N
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
N = 10
\]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 per tooth.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as she had given for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars per tooth.
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is \(2 \times 0.50 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total amount = \(5 + 3 + 1 = 9\) dollars.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of **$9.00**."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the number of goals each teenager scored based on the information given.

1. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Richie as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, Richie scored 80 goals, so \( R = 80 \).

Next, we know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as \( M \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = M + 20 \]
Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ 80 = M + 20 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Now, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ R = A + 45 \]
Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ 80 = A + 45 \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = 80 - 45 = 35 \]

Now, we have the number of goals scored by each teenager:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Mark scored 60 goals.
- Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual scores:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 for the week, we divide $70 by 7 days:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

So, Peter spends $10 each day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \]

This means he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \]

dollars left for the rest of the week. From Thursday to Sunday, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy with $30 is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of wooden action figures he bought from Sunday through Wednesday. Since each wooden action figure costs $5 and he spent $10 each day for 4 days, the number of wooden action figures he bought is:

\[ \frac{10}{5} \times 4 = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses} \]

"To find out how much money Katina will have in her savings account after 2 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of money Katina removes from her account over 2 years.
2. Subtract this total amount from her initial savings.

First, we calculate the total amount removed over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years would be 24 months. Katina removes $100 each month, so over 24 months, she will remove:

\[ 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount removed from her initial savings of $3000:

\[ 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money remaining in Katina's account after 2 years is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's find the percentage by which the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature the oven would show if it were accurate. If the oven is 4% too hot, then the actual temperature is 104% of the setting. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Then:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups.
4. Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is **120**."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
- She burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
- Total calories burned from aerobics = 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories.

For running:
- She burns 600 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running.
- Total calories burned from running = 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories.

Now, let's find the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = calories burned from aerobics + calories burned from running
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. To find out how much water she needs to drink for 1600 calories, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \]
\[ x = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."

According to the problem:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of the measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

So, we sum the three measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
52

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

Therefore, Alex will need **316 seats**."
"Let's break down the weights step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms (which is double the amount of 100 grams) would contain double the amount of protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 200 \div 100 \times 3 = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Distribute the 2 on the right side:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]

2. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \) on one side:
\[ x - 2x = -10 \]
\[ -x = -10 \]

3. Multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The extra cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already paid a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \).

George earns \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
- \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees
- \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Research Duration:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Therefore, the research lasts for 50 months in total.

3. **Funding for the Remaining Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - 50% more than $100,000 is:
     \[
     100,000 + 0.5 \times 100,000 = 100,000 + 50,000 = 150,000

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

**Final Answer:**
5 days"
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats were left:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we calculate one-third of 54:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were occupied by the students:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 36 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is:
\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ total lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 76 \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: 
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours.
   - Therefore, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum during the school day.

3. **Gum Chewing After School and After Dinner**:
   - He chews 1 piece on the way home.
   - He chews 1 piece after dinner.
   - Therefore, he chews \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) pieces of gum after school and after dinner.

4. **Total Gum Chewed by End of Day**:
   - Total pieces chewed = pieces chewed at school + pieces chewed after school and after dinner
   - Total pieces chewed = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces of gum.

5. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Initial pieces - pieces chewed = \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces of gum.

6. **Giving Half to Sister**:
   - Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.
   - Half of 14 pieces = \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces of gum.

7. **Gum Remaining After Giving to Sister**:
   - Remaining pieces = \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces of gum.

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s. Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour. To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - So, the number of cars towed each day in the last four days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the last four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total number of cars towed in the week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the last four days gives:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the required growth from feet to inches:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will need to wait 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps = 16 (snowflake stamps) + 3 = 19.
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps = 19 (truck stamps) - 9 = 10.

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

Total stamps = Snowflake stamps + Truck stamps + Rose stamps
Total stamps = 16 + 19 + 10
Total stamps = 45

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this rate. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Fish caught by Tommy} = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of classes} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10} = \$6
   \]

2. **Determine the maximum cost per class allowed by his parents:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum cost per class} = \$10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost if Manny misses some classes:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny misses. Then, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

4. **Set up the inequality to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss:**
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{10 - x} \leq \$10
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   \[
   \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
   \[
   60 \leq 10(10 - x)
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   60 \leq 100 - 10x
   \]
   Subtract 100 from both sides:
   \[
   -40 \leq -10x
   \]
   Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   4 \geq x
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 4
   \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

\[
\boxed{4}

- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{\text{Total soil to dig}}{\text{Rate of digging soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the rate through clay, which is 2 feet per hour. He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.

\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{\text{Total clay to dig}}{\text{Rate of digging clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time.

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time to dig soil} + \text{Time to dig clay} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the type of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This makes a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people}
   \]

2. Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
   \[
   27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

So, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Additional likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is **160000**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 discount:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

So, Clara paid $398.

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so for 20 pomegranates:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we calculate 10% of $600:
\[ 0.10 \times 600 = 60 \]

So, the discount is $60. Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

So, Sheila paid $540.

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \( 400 \times 2 = 800 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \( 400 + 800 = 1200 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \( 1200 + 900 = 2100 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**
2100"
"First, let's determine the total time James hires the horse-drawn carriage. He hires it from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

Since he gets 1 hour free, the effective paid time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The next two hours each cost $30.

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 30 + 30 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To find out how many dollars were withheld from Sally’s wage, we need to determine the difference between what her wage should have been and what ended up being deposited into her bank account.

1. Sally's bank account started with $200.
2. At the end of the week, her bank account has $420.
3. The difference between the final amount and the initial amount is the amount that was deposited into her account this week.

So, the amount deposited is:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Sally's weekly wage should be $300. The amount withheld from her wage is the difference between her expected wage and the amount that was actually deposited into her account:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find the number of whole eggs needed, divide the total number of deviled egg halves by 2.
   - Number of whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - Number of dozens of eggs needed = \( \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \).

Therefore, Lori will need **2 dozens** of eggs."
"Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Mike has 30 days to complete the assignment, so the number of days before the deadline that Mike will finish his reading is:

\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the first year.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.

2. **Monthly Expenses:**
   - **Hanger Rental:** $5000 per month
   - **Fuel:** Twice the cost of the hanger rental, which is \(2 \times 5000 = 10000\) dollars per month

   Therefore, the total monthly expense for hanger rental and fuel is:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

3. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the total annual expenses, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane plus the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on this information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \times 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

So, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie, and then subtract that from the total amount he spent.

   \]

Next, we add these amounts together to find the total cost of the chips, fried chicken, and soda:
\[
\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of \$20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. So, the weekly class time is:

"First, let's determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the information given:

- Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- Her first 8 days were good.
- Her next 8 days were bad.
- Her following 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days)
- Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10

Now, let's account for the last 3 days:
- The last 3 days were good, neutral, and good.
- This adds 2 more good days to the total.

So, the updated count of good days is:
- Initial good days = 12
- Additional good days from the last 3 days = 2
- Total good days = 12 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 14."

Let's say Sally has \( x \) books. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Janey's books} = 2x + 3 \]

We know that Janey has 21 books, so we can substitute 21 for Janey's books in the equation:
\[ 21 = 2x + 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2x \]
\[ 18 = 2x \]
\[ x = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has enough toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has enough toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 8 toys.
   - After the second purchase, he needed 12 more toys.
   - The total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

So, the total number of toys James needs is **20**."

\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so 8 adults would weigh:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Including Jack, who also weighs 80 kg, the total weight is:
\[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they have together. We add up the cookies each person has:

\[
68 \text{ (Katarina)} + 73 \text{ (Max)} + 61 \text{ (Cookie Monster)} + 96 \text{ (Summer)}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
68 + 73 = 141
\]
\[
141 + 61 = 202
\]
\[
202 + 96 = 298
\]

So, the total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

First, we calculate the length after extending the dress by 50% of its original length:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Next, we add the 20 cm lace trim to this length:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know that the final length of the dress is 140 cm, so we can set up the following equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have.

1. Total time they have to walk to school: 30 minutes

3. Time taken to get to the fire station: 13 minutes

First, we add the time taken to get to the library and the fire station:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we subtract the time already spent from the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John and Jack have \(\boxed{11}\) minutes left to get to school without being late."
"To find out how much Catherine pays in total, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost of apples is $4 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost for apples is \(1 \times 4 = 4\) dollars.

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost of bananas is $2 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost for bananas is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost of oranges is $3 per kilo.
   - Therefore, the cost for oranges is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add the costs together:
\[ 4 \text{ (apples)} + 4 \text{ (bananas)} + 6 \text{ (oranges)} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Catherine pays a total of **14 dollars**."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, Celinda baked:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies} \]

After baking, they eat 10 cookies. So, the number of cookies left to put in the box is:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin is \( T + 7 \).
- The other two triplets will be the same age as the first triplet, so their ages are also \( T \).

The combined ages of the four individuals are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ T + (T + 7) + T + T = 44 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4T + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4T = 37 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ T = \frac{37}{4} = 9.25 \]

So, the age of one of the triplets is 9.25 years. The age of the twin who is 7 years older is:
\[ T + 7 = 9.25 + 7 = 16.25 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{16.25} \]"
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has:
- 20 minutes of math homework
- 40 minutes of reading homework
- 20 minutes of history homework

Adding these times together, we get:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, to find out how many minutes John has left for his nap, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the candies and lollipops Manolo initially bought.

The cost of 4 candies is:
\[ 4 \text{ candies} \times \$3.20 \text{ per candy} = \$12.80 \]

The cost of 5 lollipops is:
\[ 5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00 \]

The total cost for the initial purchase is:
\[ \$12.80 + \$2.00 = \$14.80 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.

The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \text{ candies} \times \$3.20 \text{ per candy} = \$32.00 \]

"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's determine the cost of each type of fruit:
- The cost of one banana is given as twice the cost of one apple. Since one apple costs $0.50, one banana costs:
  \[
  2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The cost of one orange is three times the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs $1.00, one orange costs:
  \[
  3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate contains 5 bananas, so the total cost for the bananas is:
  \[
  5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The crate contains 12 apples, so the total cost for the apples is:
  \[
  12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- The crate contains 7 oranges, so the total cost for the oranges is:
  \[
  7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we sum the costs of all the fruits to find the total price of the crate:
\[
5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[
\boxed{32.00}

"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Next, we sum the number of all the squares to find the total number of squares in the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can represent the capacity of Gary's truck as \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + x = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8800 + x = 11600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that percentage from the total percentage of water used by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial water usage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial water usage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water in total. If 32% is used for industrial purposes, then the remaining percentage is used for non-industrial purposes.
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card. First, we calculate 10% of \$50.00:
\[
0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of 3 scoops:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin can get is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, let's find out how much candy each of them has left after 14 days.

Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"First, we need to find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. 

To find two thirds of 36 square feet, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. Therefore, for 24 square feet, he would need:
\[ 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom."
"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Total cost of picking: $65
   - Total cost at the store: $75

   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store."
"First, let's calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.

The original price per computer was $700. A 10% increase on $700 is calculated as follows:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price per computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ 385000 \]"

\[3 + 5 = 8\]

Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we subtract the number of boxes bought last week from the number of boxes bought this week:

\[8 - 4 = 4\]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week."
"To find the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, she taps each foot at 200 taps per minute.

Now, let's break down the time she spends dancing with her arms down and raised:
- She dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Out of these 5 minutes, 2 minutes are with her arms raised, and the remaining 3 minutes are with her arms down.

Next, we calculate the taps for each foot during the time her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we calculate the taps for each foot during the time her arms are raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Finally, we sum up the taps for both feet:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

The combined total number of taps is:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:
\[
\boxed{2450}

"To find out how many chairs the restaurant has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of normal chairs left after some were sent for repair.
2. Calculate the number of baby chairs left after some were sent for repair.
3. Add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together.

Let's start with the normal chairs:
- Initially, there are 170 normal chairs.
- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the number of normal chairs left is \(170 - 20 = 150\).

Next, let's calculate the baby chairs:
- Initially, there are 23 baby chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair.
- So, the number of baby chairs left is \(23 - 13 = 10\).

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
- The total number of chairs left is \(150 + 10 = 160\).

Therefore, the restaurant has \(\boxed{160}\) chairs left."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

So, the three people together ate:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \]

So, the two people together ate:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

To find the time it takes the dog, we calculate:
\[
\text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to find the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is calculated by adding the times together and then dividing by 2:
\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for cat} + \text{Time for dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"First, let's convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches and then add the additional inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \]

Since each of these 16 cars has 4 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the students' cars is:
\[ 16 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's find the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Next, let's find the total number of blue spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45

Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of her spools are blue."

1. **Initial number of people**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:
   - By midday, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by midday = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000\)

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - Remaining people = Initial number - Number of people who voted by midday
   - Remaining people = \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted.
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00 = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate her father's age as follows:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we need to find out Dora's mother's age. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Therefore, we can calculate her mother's age as follows:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their ages together:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[ \boxed{87} \]"

"First, let's calculate the number of votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes."
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:

\text{Students who like to play video games} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students who like to bake} + \text{Students who like to play basketball} + \text{Students who like to play music})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Students who like to play video games} = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 50 - 25 = 25
\]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is **25**."
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. Throwing a stone scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. 

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 birds were scared away. Now, subtract the scared birds from the initial number:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 that remained. Add these 20 birds to the 8 that were left:
\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

The final number of birds in the backyard is:
\[ 28 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of students in each class. Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

Next, we need to find out how many of these students are girls. We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find the number of girls in one class, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \]

So, there are 16 girls in each class.

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"

"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily savings.**

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- Therefore, the daily savings is $0.10 * 500 = $50.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly savings.**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- The weekly savings is $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

So, each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students. However, since we cannot have half a student, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students if we are to maintain equal group sizes.

Currently, we have 6 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed to make a total of 12 groups, we subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekday:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one week, the number of chairs rented on weekdays is \(5 \times 60 = 300\) chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs rented during a weekend:**
   - There are 2 days in a weekend.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther was left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Now, let's calculate the yearly share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Yearly share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Yearly share per roommate = $25 * 12
Yearly share per roommate = $300

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent.

- He sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, the total number of glasses is:
  \[
  8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- He also sent 4 dozen plates. The total number of plates is:
  \[
  4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a large button (since 3 small buttons = 1 large button).
   - Therefore, 27 small buttons = \(27 \times \frac{1}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers and \(40 + 9 = 49\) large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large stickers and \(49 + 24 = 73\) large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 25 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 25 large stickers = 25 large buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 25 large buttons = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(3 + 75 = 78\) small buttons.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 73 large buttons and 78 small buttons.
   - The total number of buttons is \(73 + 78 = 151\).

Therefore, the final number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(\boxed{151}\)."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

2. He gives 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. So, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils left}
   \]
3. Next, Anthony gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils left}
   \]

So, the number of pencils Anthony kept is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Calculate the time spent driving to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Calculate the time spent driving back:**
   - The distance back is the same, 150 miles, and the speed is the same, 75 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the total time spent at the museum:**
   - Time spent at the museum: 6 hours

4. **Calculate the total time Jack is gone from home:**
   - Total time = Time driving to the museum + Time at the museum + Time driving back
   - Total time = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
- Henry needs 57 cars.
- Each car requires 4 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is \(57 \times 4 = 228\) wheels.

For the motorcycles:
- Henry needs 73 motorcycles.
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is \(73 \times 2 = 146\) wheels.

Now, let's find the total number of wheels needed for both the cars and motorcycles:
- Total wheels needed = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles
- Total wheels needed = \(228 + 146 = 374\) wheels.

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels available:
- Wheels left = wheels available - wheels needed
- Wheels left = \(650 - 374 = 276\).

Therefore, the number of wheels left is 276."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost of series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost of older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]

"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then add them together.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Price per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Price per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Price per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we add the total costs for each type of fruit to find the overall amount spent:

\[
\$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

So, Winston spent a total of \(\$38.00\) on fruit."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into parts: the distance driven and the distance hiked.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for a certain amount of time at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
   - Let's denote the time spent driving as \( t_d \) hours.
   - The distance driven is given by the formula: \[ \text{Distance driven} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \times t_d \]

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
   - So, their hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
   - The distance hiked is given by the formula: \[ \text{Distance hiked} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \times 1.5 \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time spent traveling (driving and hiking) is 6 hours.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving is \( t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the Distances:**
   - Distance driven: \[ 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \text{ miles} \]
   - Distance hiked: \[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

5. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance: \[ 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

**Final Answer:**
255 miles"
"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on. According to the problem, \( A_e = E_e + 8 \).
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects. According to the problem, \( A_b = E_b + 3 \).
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level. According to the problem, \( A_t = E_t + 4 \).

The score for each player is calculated as follows:
- Score for jumping on enemies: \( 10 \times \text{(number of enemies)} \)
- Score for collecting berries: \( 5 \times \text{(number of berries)} \)
- Score for the timer: \( 30 \times \text{(time left on the timer)} \)

So, Emma's score \( S_E \) is:
\[ S_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And Ava's score \( S_A \) is:
\[ S_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ S_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ S_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ S_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ S_A - S_E = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ S_A - S_E = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"First, let's determine the total cost of the two pizzas that each cost 30 dollars. Since two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, the total cost for these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much was spent on the other two pizzas. The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the cost for the other two pizzas is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rides on the usual days:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day.
   - They do this for 5 days.
   - So, the total number of rides on these 5 days is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

2. **Determine the number of rides on the two special days:**
   - On these two days, they ride twice the usual amount.
   - The usual amount is 3 rides per day, so twice that is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) rides per day.
   - Since there are 2 such days, the total number of rides on these days is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Add the rides from the usual days and the special days.
   - Total rides = rides on usual days + rides on special days = \(15 + 12 = 27\).

So, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is **27**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, bringing the total number of fish to \(7 + 17 = 24\).
3. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as \(w\) and the number of orange fish he bought as \(o\). Therefore, the total number of white fish now is \(4 + w\) and the total number of orange fish is \(3 + o\).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[3 + o = 2(4 + w)\]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[o + w = 17\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \(3 + o = 2(4 + w)\)
2. \(o + w = 17\)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[3 + o = 8 + 2w\]
\[o - 2w = 5\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \(o - 2w = 5\)
2. \(o + w = 17\)

We can solve these equations by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, solve for \(o\):
\[o = 17 - w\]

Substitute \(o = 17 - w\) into the first equation:
\[17 - w - 2w = 5\]
\[17 - 3w = 5\]
\[12 = 3w\]
\[w = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, if \(w = 4\), then \(o = 17 - 4 = 13\). The total number of white fish now is \(4 + 4 = 8\) and the total number of orange fish is \(3 + 13 = 16\). Since 16 is indeed twice 8, our solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

   - Total cost: \(5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming \(\boxed{15}\) dollars per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie received ten twenties, which is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie received is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she spent. She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on the twenties is:

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is **25**."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the trip.
2. Calculate how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John needs to raise.
4. Determine how much more John needs to raise after accounting for the school's contribution.

Let's go through each step:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of the cost, so the school's contribution is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
3. The amount John needs to raise is the total cost minus the school's contribution:
   \[
   300 - 150 = 150
   \]
4. John currently has $50, so the additional amount he needs to raise is:

\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Nikita scored 11 more than this amount, so:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their points together:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ 428 \]"
"To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have 14 days.

\[ \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week, which has 7 days.

\[ \text{Hours played in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Find the difference in distance between the two cars:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium:

- Cost of the diamond: $600
- Cost of the gold: $300

Total cost of materials = $600 + $300 = $900

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of materials:

30% of $900 = 0.30 × $900 = $270

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of materials to find the final amount James paid:

Total cost with premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170."
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340
   - Total number of third-graders: 500
   - Pass rate for third-graders: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \) or 68%

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40
   - Total number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Pass rate for fourth-graders: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \) or 40%

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Pass rate for fifth-graders is twice the fourth-graders' pass rate.
   - Fourth-graders' pass rate: 0.40
   - Fifth-graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \) or 80%
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 680 \)
- Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Now, we find the overall pass rate:

\[ \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[ 0.68 \times 100 = 68\% \]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \( 68\% \).

**Final Answer:**
68%"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag contains 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   - Total number of glass chips = \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) chips.

2. **Calculate the number of glass chips needed per square inch:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic.

3. **Determine the total area Milo can cover with the glass chips:**
   - Total area = Total number of glass chips / Number of chips per square inch
   - Total area = \( 144 \div 12 = 12 \) square inches.

4. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let the length of the mosaic be \( L \) inches.
   - The area of the mosaic = Height \(\times\) Length
   - \( 12 = 3 \times L \)

5. **Solve for the length \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She picks another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Sum of all petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower with 5 petals: \(15 - 5 = 10\) petals.
   - She drops 1 flower with 6 petals: \(24 - 6 = 18\) petals.
   - She drops 1 flower with 4 petals: \(20 - 4 = 16\) petals.
   - She drops 1 flower with 7 petals: \(42 - 7 = 35\) petals.

4. **Total Petals After Dropping:**

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is **79**."
"First, let's determine how many marshmallows were used to make the S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. They dropped 3 marshmallows, so we subtract these from the total number of marshmallows initially in the bag:

\[ 35 - 3 = 32 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Now, we subtract the marshmallows used to make the S'mores from the remaining marshmallows:

\[ 32 - 18 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows are the ones left, and they need to be divided equally between John and DeSean. So, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[ 14 \div 2 = 7 \text{ marshmallows per person} \]

Therefore, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's break down the time each person can play with one quarter:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
3. The other friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Friend 1: 10 minutes
- Friend 2: 10 minutes
- Friend 3: 30 minutes

Now, let's find out how many quarters each person can use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters
- Friend 1: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters
- Friend 2: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters
- Friend 3: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters

So, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{68}\) quarters."
"Let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify it further:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which represents the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive amounts and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \( 3 \times 500 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \( 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount spent is \( 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away the cars. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Add the time from both days to get the total time in hours.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day. So, the time she walked on the second day is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we add the time from both days to get the total time in hours:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, 20 more cars entered the parking lot. So, the total number of cars became:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. When Hunter got out for the lunch break, half of the cars had left. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35

So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day:**
   - John does 30 cycles of work each day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks per day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the daily earnings are:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   - John works 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly earnings are:
     \[
     \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$1260/\text{week}

So, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars in a full 7-day week."
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

2. **Second Game:**
   - The second game was at Julie's home court.
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cindy had 5 green eggs.
2. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she had \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs = \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

"First, let's calculate the cost of shipping the book back to the distribution center.

The cost per pound is $0.35, and the book weighs 4 pounds:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40 \]

The cost per mile is $0.08, and the distance is 20 miles (one way), so the round trip is 40 miles:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$3.20 \]

Adding the two costs together gives the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$3.20 = \$4.60 \]

Adding the cost of the bag:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount of money she has:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the final amount of money Mulan has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is the total monthly production minus the production of the first three weeks:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ \boxed{14000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the time Britany spends on each activity per week and then for four weeks.

1. **Time spent writing songs per week:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends \(2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Time spent on makeup per week:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends \(15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(360 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Time spent recording videos per week:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent recording videos per week: \(18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}\).
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(72 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 1.2 \text{ hours/week}\).
   - For 4 weeks: \(1.2 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4.8 \text{ hours}\).

Now, add up all the time spent on these activities in a month:
- Writing songs: 8 hours
- Makeup: 6 hours
- Recording videos: 4.8 hours

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
\[8 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 4.8 \text{ hours} = 18.8 \text{ hours}\]

**Final Answer:**
18.8"
"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The base installation cost for 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.

2. Angela needs additional items:
   - 2 more mirrors (6 total - 4 already included in the base cost)
   - 1 more chandelier (2 total - 1 already included in the base cost)
   - 10 more pictures (20 total - 10 already included in the base cost)

3. The cost for additional items is $15.00 per item.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- Cost for 2 additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for 1 additional chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for 10 additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Adding these to the base cost:

\[129 + 30 + 15 + 150 = 324\]

So, the total cost for Angela will be **$324.00**."
"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]

So, Roy's savings are:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 12 = 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that Naruto can lift a mountain, given the relationships between the lifting capacities of Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei.

1. **Pompei's Lifting Capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's Lifting Capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's Lifting Capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's Lifting Capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert Inches to Feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Part of the Journey:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
   - Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos and the distance they travel. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance, we can denote the distance as \(D\) and the speed of each kangaroo as \(S\). The total distance \(D\) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For 3 kangaroos traveling at speed \(S\) for 18 hours, the distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = 3S \times 18 \]
\[ D = 54S \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to travel the same distance \(D\). Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

The time \(T\) it takes for one turtle to travel the distance \(D\) is:

\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{Speed of one turtle}} \]
\[ T = \frac{54S}{\frac{S}{2}} \]
\[ T = 54S \times \frac{2}{S} \]
\[ T = 108 \text{ hours} \]

Since all four turtles are traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance simultaneously, the time it takes for all four turtles to travel the distance is the same as the time it takes for one turtle. Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance is:

\[ \boxed{108} \]"
"First, let's determine how many clay dishes each person made based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora. So, Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. So, Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the reduced price of the new laptop:**
   The original price of the new laptop is $600. With the trade-in, the price is reduced by $200.
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
   So, the reduced price of the new laptop is $400.

2. **Determine the total amount of money Erika has:**
   Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means she currently has:
   \[
   400 - 50 = 350
   \]
   So, Erika has $350 in total.

3. **Calculate the amount of money in her purse:**
   Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gave her $80. Let \( x \) be the amount of money she has in her purse. The total amount of money she has is:
   \[
   x + 150 + 80 = 350
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 350 - 230 = 120
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

**15**"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently gets from his 3 cows.

Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows produce:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk he needs, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these amounts.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}\)

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}\)

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\)
   - Unused portion: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}\)

Now, we sum the unused portions of all three glue sticks:
\[2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}\]

**Final Answer:**
16 millimeters"

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by $20:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract $70 from $80:

\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Total students: 20

First, we find out how many students are good at both subjects. We do this by subtracting the number of students good at math only and those good at English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math (both only and both), we add the students good at math only to those good at both:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students good at math is 12.

**Final Answer: 12**"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Available time for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups"
"To solve this problem, we need to understand how simple interest works. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this case, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, let's determine the annual interest rate. The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, this interpretation seems incorrect because an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical. Instead, it should be interpreted as 75% of the original amount per year. So, the correct annual interest rate is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = 0.75 \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Now, we can calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount after 3 years will be the original principal plus the total interest earned:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total white shirts: 40
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars:

- Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
- Number of white shirts with no collars: 20

The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

Final numerical answer:
10"
"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

So, the farmer will earn \(\$75\)."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the cost per basket of red food is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Add the total cost of the green food and the red food together.
   - The total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is **$123**."
"First, let's determine how many rooms make up one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to clean these 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room:

\[ 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of all ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

- Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

So, the total number of people infected after three days is **3430**."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

So, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\) oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges she remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a year."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the number of banana bread loaves she baked in those 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, in 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has:

70 (gold coins) - 30 = 40 (silver coins)

70 (gold coins) + 40 (silver coins) = 110 coins

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- So, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
- Mr. George ordered 600 burritos.
- The number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]
3. **Blue Cars**: They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
4. **Total Cars**: The rink has 75 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
   \[
   75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23
   \]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13 \]
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Next, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

1. The weight of the bag of potatoes is 5 pounds.
2. The weight of the bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. So, the weight of the sweet potatoes is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes. So, the weight of the carrots is:
   \[
   10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, we calculate:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can set up the following calculation:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."
"First, we calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, let's calculate how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining 40%:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month):

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week."

The rope is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 a meter. So, the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah plans to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, we'll assume she buys the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters. Therefore, the cost of the new rope is:
\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the original rope to find out how much money she will have left over:

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon = $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken = $10 / 5 packs * 2 = $4.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all items:

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"First, let's find out how many microphones won't find any space to fit in. Since 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in. This means the remaining microphones that can be arranged in pairs are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the number of microphones that can be paired by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

   Therefore, 4 birds are flying overhead.
3. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after removing the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of a whirligig based on the given information about the speeds of a thingamabob and a whatchamacallit.

1. Let's denote the speed of a thingamabob as \( x \) meters per second.
2. According to the problem, a whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second.
3. We are given that the speed of a whatchamacallit is 121 meters per second. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   11x = 121
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
   So, the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.
5. A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

1. **Identify the total earnings and the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - We need to find out how much she made from mowing lawns and how much from lemonade sales.

2. **Define variables for the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
   - The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

3. **Determine the payment for mowing each lawn:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
   - Let's assume the payment for mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns is the same as Joe's, which is $6 per mow.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( 6J \)
   - Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 6 \times 3J = 18J \)
   - Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 6 \times 5J = 30J \)
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \)

5. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns plus earnings from lemonade sales equals $80.
   - Let \( L \) be the earnings from lemonade sales.
   - Therefore, \( 54J + L = 80 \)

6. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, and she mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times, we have \( 6J = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \).

7. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Substitute \( J = 1 \) into the equation for total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 54J = 54 \times 1 = 54 \).

8. **Calculate the earnings from lemonade sales:**
   - Total earnings: \( 80 \)
   - Earnings from mowing lawns: \( 54 \)
   - Earnings from lemonade sales: \( 80 - 54 = 26 \)

Therefore, Tasha made \(\boxed{26}\) dollars from lemonade sales."
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight of 55 kg:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight of 71 kg:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight of 79 kg:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting out his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, and he gets paid $25 an hour. So, the total hours he rents out his car each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate his total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Now, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500. So, his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, we can find out how many she originally had by subtracting 5 from 7:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Next, we know that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. Therefore, we calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had as follows:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph after her purchase. Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph still has 6 notebooks. We find the difference by subtracting the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the distance Anis rowed. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, we calculate Anis's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right) \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{Anis's distance} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. So, we subtract these 4 cookies from the total of 100 cookies:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. We do this by dividing 96 by 6:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get \(\boxed{16}\) cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to find the total amount of soup.

If four adult's bowls are filled, then the total amount of soup is enough for 4 adult bowls.

Now, let's see how much soup is needed for the family's dinner. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have two children. So, they need 2 adult bowls + 2 child bowls for dinner.

Since 4 adult bowls are equivalent to 8 child bowls, we can calculate the total amount of soup needed for dinner:
- 2 adult bowls = 2 adult bowls (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls, 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls, so 2 adult bowls = 4 child bowls)
- 2 child bowls = 2 child bowls

So, the total amount of soup needed for dinner is 4 child bowls + 2 child bowls = 6 child bowls.

Calvin has 8 child bowls of soup in total. After dinner, the leftover soup will be:
8 child bowls - 6 child bowls = 2 child bowls

Since each child can have one bowl of soup, and there are 2 child bowls left, each child will be able to have:
2 child bowls / 2 children = 1 bowl of soup

So, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Final answer:

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \text{ notebooks} \times \$1.50 \text{ per notebook} = \$7.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen:
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.
- William bought 1 ballpen.

So, the total cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \text{ ballpen} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ballpen} = \$0.50 \]

Now, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total amount William spent:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 small mask, we divide 2 yards by 4:
  \[
  \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply 0.5 yards by 20:
  \[
  0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to find out how much material is needed for 1 large mask, we divide 2.25 yards by 3:
  \[
  \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
  \]
- To find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply 0.75 yards by 8:
  \[
  0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total material needed:
\[
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

So, Jo would need \boxed{16} yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets purchased.

First, let's calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times, which means she bought 27 tickets.

Next, we know that she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount of money spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Dean originally had 30 marbles. After giving away 16 marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, the number of marbles left for Dean is 14."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the current ages of Duncan and Adam. Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2 \times (A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

Final answer:

"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"

\[ \text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ \text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10.
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times \$10/\text{movie} = \$50
     \]
   - Colby has already seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7.
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times \$7/\text{movie} = \$56
     \]
   - Colby has already had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times \$8/\text{tub} = \$16
     \]
   - Colby has already had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times \$2/\text{box} = \$8
     \]
   - Adding these amounts together gives the total spent so far:
     \[
     \$50 + \$56 + \$16 + \$8 = \$130
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount Colby has to spend:**
   - Colby's parents give him $150 each month.
     \[
     \$150 - \$130 = \$20
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of one movie and one snack:**
   - Since it is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, the movie ticket costs $10.
   - Colby wants to buy a tub of popcorn and a box of candy.
     \[
     \$8 + \$2 = \$10
     \]

4. **Calculate how many more movies Colby can see:**
   - Colby has $20 left and the cost of one movie and one snack is $10.
     \[
     \frac{\$20}{\$10} = 2
     \]

Therefore, Colby can see \(\boxed{2}\) more movies."
"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
   - Therefore, each mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
   - Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
   - Therefore, each mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
   - Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: \( 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**
   \[
   39
   \]

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   Since she removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday each day:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Tuesday)}
   \]
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ (for Wednesday)}
   \]

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**
   \[
   48
   \]

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**
   \[
   57
   \]

Next, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day to find the total:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Now, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. Using the same formula:

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the numbers of each type of toy:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 \]

Now, substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( P \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2j + 10 + j + 10 + j = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( \boxed{50} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
2. Maria gave herself 1 water balloon.
3. Maria's mom then gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.

First, calculate the number of balloons given by Maria:
- Maria gave 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria gave herself 1 balloon: \(1\) balloon.

So, the total number of balloons given by Maria is:
\[8 + 1 = 9\]

Next, calculate the number of balloons given by Maria's mom:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
\[9 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

Since they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet

Next, we find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance = Distance spat by Zoey + Distance spat by Sydney
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

Now, we calculate the average total distance spat:
- Average total distance = Total distance / Number of participants
- Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

"First, let's calculate the total time Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour.

1. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
2. The number of additional hours after the first 12 hours is \(17 - 12 = 5\) hours.
3. The cost for these additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for a 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

To find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of his chosen option from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Each goat needs 5 pounds, so twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay needed for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay needed for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs. The total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}

"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

"To find out how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is $35 per hour (or part thereof), we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$83.75
   \]
3. **Parts Cost**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$40 + \$83.75 + \$60 = \$183.75
\]

So, the total charge for the job is:
\[
\boxed{183.75}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

However, since he only sold them for $40 each, the total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out of after selling 5 of the CDs. The total cost of the CDs after the discount is $90, and he sold 5 CDs for a total of $200, but since he only had 10 CDs to begin with, the $200 is the amount he received from selling those 5 CDs.

The net amount he was out of is the initial cost minus the amount he received from selling the CDs:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]

This is because the correct interpretation should be the initial cost minus the value of the CDs he kept, which is $90 - (5 \times \$40 - 5 \times \$15) = \$90 - \$50 = \$40, but since he sold them for $200, the net is $90 - $50 = $70 less."
"To find out how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

"To find Leo's age, let's break down the information given:

1. Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.

First, we find Marcus's age:
Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we subtract 5 from Deanna's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Next, we use the information that Marcus is half of Leo’s age to find Leo's age:
\[ \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age} \]
To find Leo's age, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ \text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored.

We can write these as equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equation for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 100 pages are stacked in 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages are in 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Since each paper is printed on both sides, each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pages:**
   - Each sheet of paper has 2 pages, so the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Vince's stapling rate is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

**Final Answer:**
1800 reports"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. is 6:00, so 5 minutes earlier is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes (160 minutes).
   - Total time awake before getting out of bed: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - Time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake that day:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes.
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time awake: \( 220 + 23 = 243 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was in bed that day:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Total time awake: 243 minutes.
   - Time in bed: \( 480 - 243 = 237 \) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of unoccupied beds initially:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

Now, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

After 2 weeks, the number of occupied beds will be the initial number of occupied beds plus the number of new admissions:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ occupied beds} \]

Finally, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. Two-thirds of the 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means that 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Since the remaining emails are 3, and one-third of these are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old Shawna's father is. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so we calculate his age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly says that number is 20% more than the actual number, we need to find the actual number of people.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number of people. This can be written as:
\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Now, perform the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \( 40 \)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then we can substitute \( 2J = 2 \) to find \( J \):
\[ J = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls by substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes by the end of the third day after filling in two holes.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, they filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, there were 29 holes.

The number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is 10. Therefore, the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes by the end of the fourth day and the number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Since only two people got an equal amount of corn chips, and the third person (Collins) received 15 more corn chips than the others, we can write the following equation for the total number of corn chips:

\[ 70 + 70 + (70 + 15) \]

First, calculate the number of corn chips Collins received:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend watching all the episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled south is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day.

1. **Brownies made by Greta:**
   - Greta made one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   - Since one dozen equals 12 brownies, she made 12 brownies.

2. **Brownies received from the office party:**
   - She received 1/2 a dozen brownies from her office.
   - 1/2 dozen equals 6 brownies.

3. **Brownies received from the surprise party:**
   - Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   - 4 dozen equals 48 brownies.

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   - Adding all the brownies together:
     \[
     12 \text{ (from Greta)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
     \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies.

6. **Brownies left over:**
   - Subtract the brownies eaten from the total brownies:

"First, let's determine the ages of each family member:

1. Nani is 8 years old.
2. Nani's brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
3. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(0.25 \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]
So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones gives:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we find the total number of players in both teams combined by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ 33 \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister:
\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes given away from the total number of boxes:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

These 8 boxes are the ones she kept and possibly sold. She kept 1/4 of these boxes for herself:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the boxes she had after giving some away:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

These 6 boxes are the ones she sold. Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books. He has already saved $14, so we subtract this from the total cost:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

So, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"First, let's break down the sales for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 5 more boxes than on Saturday
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

Let's calculate the number of boxes sold each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: Since it's 4 fewer boxes than on Sunday, we need to find out how many boxes were sold on Sunday first.

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 5 more boxes than on Saturday, so \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Now, we can find out how many apple pies were sold on Saturday:
- Apple pie on Saturday: \(15 - 4 = 11\) boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$60\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(11 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$165\)
- Total earnings for Saturday: \(\$60 + \$165 = \$225\)

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$6 = \$90\)
- Apple pie earnings: \(15 \text{ boxes} \times \$15 = \$225\)
- Total earnings for Sunday: \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\)

   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24.
   - Therefore, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}D\).
   - Solving for \(D\), we get \(D = 24 \times 2 = 48\).

3. **Determine the current age of Emil's dad:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old now.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24.
   - Therefore, \(24 = 2B\).
   - Solving for \(B\), we get \(B = \frac{24}{2} = 12\).

5. **Determine the current age of Emil's brother:**
   - Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old now.

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   - Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.
   - The sum of their ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add up all the beads:

- Beads from her mother: 20
- Beads from her sister: 30
- Beads from her friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total pounds of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders and band members)} = 12 \text{ students} \]

So, the final number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people (which is 2 in this case):

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Charlie's boot size} + \text{Sophie's boot size}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost.

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is \(12 \div 12 = 1\) foot.
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space needed for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - For each plant, the total space required is \(1 + 1.5 = 2.5\) feet.

3. **Determine the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - The number of plants that can fit is \(111 \div 2.5 = 44.4\).
   - Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - The number of additional plants needed is \(44 - 17 = 27\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - The total cost is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"First, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats \(\boxed{63}\) pretzels in a week."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket:

- For petunias: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00\)
- For sweet potato vines: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all baskets is:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she can spend on shoes each month, which is the amount she sets aside for shoes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on shoes each month} = \$500.00 \]

Now, we calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \text{ pairs} \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs, which means she can buy 0.5 pairs per month.

To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by the number of months in a year (12).

\[ \text{Number of shoes per year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:

1. **Peeling Shrimp:**
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:
     \[
     \text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
     \]
   - Since each set takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time to complete both tasks is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner Running:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \, \text{degrees} + 12 \, \text{degrees} = 18 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \, \text{degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \, \text{degrees} - 4 \, \text{degrees} = 14 \, \text{degrees}\).

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).
   - According to the problem, \( D = 30 \) years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \( 90 - 75 = 15 \) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes \(12\) checks for the electric bill.

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Similarly, he writes \(12\) checks for the gas bill.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks to the church.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes \(4\) checks to the pest and lawn service.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \]

So, Buford writes a total of \(52\) checks per year."
"Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 44 = \frac{F}{2} \]
Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = 44 \times 2 = 88 \]

So, the first plane makes 88 flights in one day.

Next, we need to determine how many of these flights are to France. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The number of remaining flights is:
\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Twice as long as Tobias's howl, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous's howl**: The combined length of Tobias's and Chikote's howls, so \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

1. The cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

So, Adam received a total of $18 from his parents. Since the trousers cost $30, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
- Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
- The total age of the children is 20 years.
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can write the equation for the total age of the children:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \( H + W = 13 \), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Given that \( H \) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Total from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The ""everyone else"" here refers to the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer's contribution is:

3 * $2000 = $6000

However, before the lawyer makes this contribution, Walter's friend also gives him $200. This $200 is part of the total amount collected but does not affect the lawyer's contribution, which is based on the initial total of $2000.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution remains:

$6000

Final numerical answer:
$6000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The family consists of 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. According to the instructions, we multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

The formula to calculate distance is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Brook Hills High School enrolls 3000 students.
- Half of these students are over 16 years old, so the number of students over 16 is:
  \[
  \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
  \]
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 is:
  \[
  \frac{1500}{4} = 375
  \]
- Therefore, the number of female students over 16 is:
  \[
  1500 - 375 = 1125
  \]

- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so the number of students under 16 is:
  \[
  \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
  \]
- One-half of the students under 16 are male, so the number of male students under 16 is:
  \[
  \frac{1500}{2} = 750
  \]
- Therefore, the number of female students under 16 is:
  \[
  1500 - 750 = 750
  \]

- To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and the number of female students under 16:
  \[
  1125 + 750 = 1875
  \]

So, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is:
\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many laps each person can run in one hour.

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so:
   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps}
   \]
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so:
   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps}
   \]
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so:
   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps}
\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**

   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**

   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped over two days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining capacity of the tank:**

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final charge percentage to the initial charge percentage when Maria left for the park.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).

   \[
   x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   So, the charge percentage at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge percentage at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

   So, the charge percentage when Maria left for the park was approximately 55.7%.

**Final Answer:**
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns per hour in total from her wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne has 10 friends, and she distributed the sweets equally among them. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \times (1 + \text{rate})^{\text{time}} \]

Here, the present value (initial price) is $120, the rate is 5% or 0.05, and the time is 3 years. Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ 1.05 \times 1.05 = 1.1025 \]
\[ 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625 \]

So, the future value is:

\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding 138.915 to the nearest integer, we get:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time per page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:** The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:** 24 guests checked out early.
   - Guests after early checkouts: \(100 - 24 = 76\)

3. **Late checkouts:** 15 guests opted for a late checkout.
   - Guests after late checkouts: \(76 - 15 = 61\)

4. **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   - Number of people who checked in: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
   - Guests after afternoon check-ins: \(61 + 30 = 91\)

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:** 7 more people checked in.
   - Final number of guests: \(91 + 7 = 98\)

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is **98**."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picked each day.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas picked each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, John has a total of 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the total number of questions and categorize them:

- Total number of questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
- Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
- These 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so:
  - Average questions: \(36 / 2 = 18\)
  - Difficult questions: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Next, we calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct in each category:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct.
  - Number of easy questions she gets correct: \(0.75 \times 24 = 18\)

- Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
  - Number of average questions she gets correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

- Difficult questions: Aries is also sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
  - Number of difficult questions she gets correct: \(18 / 2 = 9\)

Now, we sum up the total number of questions she is sure to get correct:

- Total correct answers: \(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

Therefore, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal.
- Let \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal.
- Let \( s \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( l \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( S = 4 \) (each small stuffed animal costs $4).
2. \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) (each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one).
3. \( s = 2l \) (Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones).
4. The total earnings from the sales are $120.

The total earnings can be expressed as:
\[ 4s + 12l = 120 \]

Substituting \( s = 2l \) into the equation:
\[ 4(2l) + 12l = 120 \]
\[ 8l + 12l = 120 \]
\[ 20l = 120 \]
\[ l = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( s = 2l \):
\[ s = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

1. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
2. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
3. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we calculate the total for one week (7 days):
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes.

From the cookies:
80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80

From the cupcakes:

$300"
"To find out how many eggs the friends found, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of eggs hidden: 100 eggs.
2. Calculate the number of eggs found by the Smith twins: 30 eggs each, so \(30 + 30 = 60\) eggs.
3. Subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins and the 10 eggs that were not found from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs the friends found.

So, the calculation is:
\[100 - 60 - 10 = 30\]

Therefore, the friends found \(\boxed{30}\) eggs."
"First, let's determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.

1. With a bare hand, one dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so:
   \[
   24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

1. One dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
2. Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine:
   \[
   40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]
3. Over 30 days, they can mine:
   \[
   1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

So, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - There's a 50% chance of this happening.
   - If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - There's a 40% chance of this happening.
   - If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus getting a personal extension:**
   - There's a 20% chance of this happening.
   - If this happens, Marcus still doesn't have to turn in his homework.

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the complementary probability of all the scenarios where he doesn't have to turn it in.

First, calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:
- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension: 40% or 0.40
- Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20

The combined probability of any of these scenarios happening is:
\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.20 = 1.10 \]

However, since these are not mutually exclusive events, we need to consider the probability of the intersection of these events. The correct approach is to find the probability that none of these scenarios happen, which is the complement of the sum of the probabilities of each scenario.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - (0.50 + 0.40 + 0.20) = 1 - 1.10 = 0 \]

This calculation is incorrect because the probabilities are not additive in this context. Instead, we should consider the probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension and Marcus not getting a personal extension.

The probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension is:
\[ 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 \]

The probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension given that the normal teacher did not give an extension is:
\[ 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 \]

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 0.50 + (0.60 \times 0.80) = 0.50 + 0.48 = 0.98 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.98 \times 100 = 98\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{98\%} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium-sized jelly bean is:
     \[
     3 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]
   - To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized jelly beans by 3:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the final number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total parking expenses:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the parking expenses from her total earnings to find her net earnings:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate her net pay per hour by dividing her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - The number of intervals between bottles is \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time to set off all the soda fountains:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **40 seconds**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of apples Uncle Franky has:

- There are 40 apples in one box.
- He ordered two boxes, so the total number of apples is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make with 80 apples, given that each pack contains 8 apples:

- The number of packs is \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

So, Uncle Franky can make \(\boxed{10}\) packs of apples."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese Amor buys:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.

\[ \text{Cost of Parmesan} = 2 \, \text{pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese Amor buys:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.

\[ \text{Cost of Mozzarella} = 3 \, \text{pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, let's find the total cost of both types of cheese:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of Parmesan} + \text{Cost of Mozzarella} = \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money she has:

\[ \text{Money left} = \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - For 4 years, he would have earned = $25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total money lost from not working while in school:**
   - Total money lost = $100,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay back the loans and the money lost:**
   - Total amount needed = Total amount borrowed + Total money lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His new income is triple his previous income.
   - New annual income = 3 * $25,000 = $75,000.

6. **Determine how long it would take to earn the total amount needed:**
   - Time needed = Total amount needed / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \] square feet."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( -5 \) dollars.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) dollars.
   - Winning amount in the second race: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \) dollars.
   - Win in the second race: \( +11 \) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \) dollars.
   - Loss in the third race: \( -16.5 \) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won or lost:

- Total loss: \( -5 + (-16.5) = -21.5 \) dollars.
- Total win: \( +11 \) dollars.

Net result:
- Net amount: \( -21.5 + 11 = -10.5 \) dollars.

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(-3.5\) dollars.

**Final numerical answer:**
\(-3.5\)"
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. So, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over 21 days:**
   - Since each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day for 21 days, the total fraction of a day worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 21 = \frac{3 \times 21}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Convert the total fraction of days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     7.875 \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, each painter put in \(\boxed{189}\) hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 2010 - 2007 = 3.

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of books written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, there are 25 English books.

Next, we calculate the number of books written in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 German books.

To find the number of books written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 Spanish books.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. She drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days. So, we multiply 325 kilometers by 4:

\[ 325 \times 4 = 1300 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance between San Diego and New York City:

\[ 1955 - 1300 = 655 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive:

\[ \boxed{655} \text{ kilometers} \]"
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Romeo boards a train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100 people) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, the cost is $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

The final cost to renovate the kitchen floor is **$2400**."
"First, let's calculate the new monthly cost after the 60% increase.

The normal cost is $120 a month. A 60% increase on $120 is calculated as follows:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays \(\$2304\) a year."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king size bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to determine how many loads of laundry he needs to do. The machine can wash:
- 2 twin sets of sheets at a time
- 1 king set of sheets at a time

For the twin sheets:
- \(208 \text{ twin sheets} \div 2 \text{ twin sheets per load} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \(52 \text{ king sheets} \div 1 \text{ king sheet per load} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of loads of laundry:
- \(104 \text{ loads} + 52 \text{ loads} = 156 \text{ loads}\)

"First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food Imma's cats consume in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the daily consumption is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 120 \, \text{grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[ \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{120 \, \text{grams/day}} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. **Becky's Slices:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

Thus, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( D \). We do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:
\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of each item:

1. **Cost of the cast:** $200
2. **Cost of the visit:** The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's find out how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day.

Now, let's find out how many emails he does need to respond to each day:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."

So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate the number of meatballs in the initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - \(7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}\).

3. **Determine how many meatballs Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - \(4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 16 \text{ meatballs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate:**
   - \(28 \text{ meatballs} - 16 \text{ meatballs} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

5. **Determine the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - \(3 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 12 \text{ meatballs}\).

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - The remaining meatballs after Mark ate plus the additional meatballs ordered.
   - \(12 \text{ meatballs} + 12 \text{ meatballs} = 24 \text{ meatballs}\).

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
300 \text{ tons}
\]"
"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter bought, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is:
     \[
     4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   Since each set of 1.5 pounds costs $6.00, the total cost for 4 sets is:
   \[
   4 \times 6.00 = 24.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of people who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For each additional guest beyond the first 20, the cost is $6. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base rental fee to the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. Let's denote Maggie's original amount of money as \( M \). We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's determine Riza's original amount of money. Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. Let's denote Riza's original amount of money as \( R \). We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's find out how many bananas each monkey eats per day.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
- The first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas in a week.
- The second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas in a week.

Together, the first and second monkeys eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

Since the total number of bananas is 315, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas:
\[ 315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas in a week} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

**Final Answer:**
21"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle and then finished another entire 500 piece puzzle.

Half of a 500 piece puzzle is:
\[ \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Teddy finished 250 pieces from the first puzzle and all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

The total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[ 250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 750 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs more money to cover the cost. The florist offers a deal where a dozen roses cost $15, but since Jenny is buying individual roses, she must pay the $2 per rose.

Jenny needs an additional:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

To make up the $5, Jenny needs to provide an additional $5. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to find out how many quarters Jenny will receive as change after paying the $30.

Jenny pays with $25 and needs to provide an additional $5, so the total amount paid is:

\[ \$25 + \$5 = \$30 \]

Since the roses cost exactly $30, Jenny will receive no change in dollars. However, the florist gives change in quarters. Since the transaction is exactly $30, the change Jenny receives is:

\[ \$30 - \$30 = \$0 \]

Since $0 in dollars is equivalent to 0 quarters, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \( 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \) dollars

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \( 9 \times 11 = 99 \) dollars

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \( 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \) dollars

Now, we sum up the totals from each item:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.
   - Leaves after 65 minutes (60 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 65 minutes after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 130 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves at 130 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 130 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 150 minutes.

Paul arrives at the station just as the first train is about to arrive, which is at 10 minutes. His train, the fourth train, arrives at 150 minutes. 

To find out how long Paul waits, we subtract the time he arrives from the time his train arrives:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Paul will wait for a total of 140 minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. We subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can determine how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price.

Original price of the watch = $2000

Price Mr. Rogers bought it for = 75% of $2000
\[ = 0.75 \times 2000 \]
\[ = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

Price Mr. Rogers sold it for = 120% of $1500
\[ = 1.20 \times 1500 \]
\[ = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.

The original price of the watch = $2000
The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid = $1800

Discount = Original price - Price paid by friend
\[ = 2000 - 1800 \]
\[ = 200 \]

Percentage discount = \(\frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Original price}} \times 100\)
\[ = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 \]
\[ = 0.1 \times 100 \]
\[ = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
72000"
"To find Frankie's score, we can use the information given in the problem. We know that Binkie's score is 90, and Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

First, let's express this relationship with a formula. If Binkie's score is \( B \) and Frankie's score is \( F \), then:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Given that Binkie's score \( B \) is 90, we substitute 90 for \( B \) in the formula:
\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Distance to the Store**: The store is 4 miles away from James's home.
2. **Halfway Point**: James walks halfway to the store, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.
3. **Realization and Return**: James realizes he forgot something and walks back home, covering another 2 miles.
4. **Total Distance Walked**: The total distance James walks is \( 2 \) miles (to the halfway point) + \( 2 \) miles (back home) = \( 4 \) miles.
5. **Speed**: James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find the time it took James to walk the total distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the halfway point and return home. 

**Final Answer:**
1 hour"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking Bikes:**
   - Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - Number of Trekking bikes = \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **BMX Bikes:**
   - 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - Number of BMX bikes = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \).

3. **MTB Bikes:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - Number of MTB bikes = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
   - Number of MTB bikes = \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \).

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes:**
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450.
   - Total earnings from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes:**
   - Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - Total earnings from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes:**
   - Price of one MTB bike = $500.
   - Total earnings from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \).

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings.

- Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes + Earnings from MTB bikes
- Total earnings = \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \).

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bales made by the farmer in one hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Determine the number of bales picked up by the truck in one hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net increase in the number of bales in the field per hour:**
   - Net increase per hour = Bales made by the farmer - Bales picked up by the truck
   - Net increase per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

4. **Calculate the total net increase in the number of bales over 6 hours:**
   - Total net increase = Net increase per hour × Number of hours
   - Total net increase = 2 bales/hour × 6 hours = 12 bales

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net increase.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

**Final Answer:**
12 bales"
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes (class time) + 100 minutes (extra learning) = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time in hours = 1700 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

28.3333 hours"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

**Step 1: Determine the initial height.**
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the height after the first bounce.**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the height after the second bounce.**
The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are both 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are both 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial conditions:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 9 sodas in total.
- Out of these 9 sodas, 3 are shaken and 6 are unshaken.

Next, Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- After Ellen's brother takes his share, there are 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas left.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There are 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas left, making a total of 6 sodas.

The probability that the soda Ellen's friend picks is shaken is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 33.33\% \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:**
   - The first train travels \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
   - The second train travels \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Therefore, the total distance is \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

**Final Answer:**
270 miles"
"First, let's calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Therefore, the total number of days is \(31 + 19 = 50\) days.

Next, we need to find out how many days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off.

- 20% of 50 days is \(0.20 \times 50 = 10\) days.

So, the number of days he works is \(50 - 10 = 40\) days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps per day is:

- \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Now, we calculate the total number of people he helps over the 40 days he works:

- \(6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
   - There are 12 buses, and each bus carries 35 people.
   - So, the total number of people the buses can carry is \(12 \times 35 = 420\).

2. Calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
   - There are 20 cars, and each car carries 3 people.
   - So, the total number of people the cars can carry is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

3. Add the number of people that the buses and cars can carry to find the total number of people inside the church:
   - The total number of people is \(420 + 60 = 480\).

Therefore, the number of people inside the church is \(\boxed{480}\)."
"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:

"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To find the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is 240, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."

"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores.

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (since it's ""well over 4 hours longer"") = 9 hours.

Now, we add up the total time spent by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 2 \text{ workers} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding these together, the first four workers produce:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means the first four workers have produced:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

So, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. **Rob received 7 stickers from Kris.** Before giving 7 stickers to Rob, Kris had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Kris received 16 stickers from Luis.** Since Kris kept half of what Luis gave her, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Luis received 32 stickers from Seth.** Since Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had **64 stickers** in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

- John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces.
- Total weight = 3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces.

Next, we need to find out how many M&M are in these 30 ounces:

- 1 ounce contains 30 M&M.
- Therefore, 30 ounces contain 30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M.

Now, we need to determine how many small bags John can fill if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

- Total M&M = 900.
- Each small bag contains 10 M&M.
- Number of small bags = 900 M&M / 10 M&M/bag = 90 small bags.

So, the final numerical answer is:

90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Alfie needs to fly:**
   - The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers.
   - Half of the way around the earth is:
     \[
     \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days required:**
   - Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.
   - To find the number of days, we divide the total distance by the distance flown per day:
     \[
     \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Eggs Painted**: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs.
2. **Arnold and Madeline**: Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold painted as \( A \) and the number of eggs Madeline painted as \( M \). Since they painted the same number, \( A = M \).
3. **Camden and Sarah**: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Let's denote the number of eggs Camden painted as \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted as \( S \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
4. **Camden Painted 12 More Than Sarah**: Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

Now, we can substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]
So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since \( C = S + 12 \), Camden painted:
\[ C = 9 + 12 = 21 \]
So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56. We can express this as:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can rewrite it as:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]
So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce and there are 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's earnings as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's earnings} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie's mother earns. Her mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. First, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary of Valerie and her brother} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Now, we calculate the mother's earnings:

\[ \text{Mother's earnings} = 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

Finally, we add up the earnings of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, given the distances and speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

First, let's denote the speed at which Grandma walks on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) miles per minute.

We know that she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the distance on the beach is 2 miles. Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can find her speed on the beach:
\[
40 = \frac{2}{v} \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Now, we can find her speed on the sidewalk:
\[
2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is 1 mile, and her speed on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute. Using the same formula:
\[
\text{time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[
40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many more weeks it will take for her to save the remaining $28, given that she saves $4 each week.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if we subtract the 24 marbles he receives from the total of 60 marbles, we can find out how many marbles he originally has:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he originally has:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, he will have 26 marbles.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 26 \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The total temperature of the mixed water is the sum of the temperatures of the water from both mugs, divided by the total volume. Therefore, the average temperature of the mixed water is:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows after three weeks**: 50 initial cows + 420 cows added = 470 cows
- **Total chickens after three weeks**: 20 initial chickens + 210 chickens added = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total number of animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the number of bagels:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops per 3 potatoes}
   \]
   Therefore, 1 scoop of mashed potatoes requires:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \text{ potatoes}

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to find the number of men and women:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

Next, we need to find out how many women remain on the bus after 20 women alight. Initially, there are 54 women, and 20 women leave, so the number of women remaining is:

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, we know the probability of winning for the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:

"First, let's find out the length of the second song. The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long.

To find 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \times 5 = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. Therefore, the length of the second song is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

**Final Answer:**
13 minutes"
"First, let's determine the selling price of one mobile device. Linus buys each device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price. Therefore, the selling price of one device is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the profit from selling one device. The profit from one device is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is:

\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

Since he makes a profit of $20 from each device, the total profit from selling all 6 devices is:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the height of Ned. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find Carl's height. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce 5 bottles (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

3. **Determine how many bottles Hortex can currently produce:**
   - Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles needed is \(11500 - 4200 = 7300\) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

Out of these 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple. 

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula for conditional probability:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearing bow babies}}{\text{Total number of bow babies}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 50\% \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   - A quarter of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Adding up all the money he earned from the sales:
     - First sale: $50
     - Second sale: $30
     - Final sale: $90
   - Total earnings: \( 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \) dollars.

So, the final amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is **$170**."
"To find Geb's age, we start by using the information given in the problem. We know that Haley is 26 years old and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.

First, we calculate half of Haley's age:
\[

Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
\[
13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.

2. **Number of outings per day:**
   Tyrion goes out three times a day.

3. **Face masks used per day:**
   Since he changes his mask two times per outing and goes out three times a day, the number of face masks he uses per day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Face masks used in 2 days:**
   To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses per day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

So, Tyrion uses **12 face masks** every 2 days."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**: Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**: Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**: Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar. So, Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**: Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. So, Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: Mei finds half as many as Charlie. So, Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children:
- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

The total number of eggs found is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. To find 60% of 400 apartments:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments}\]

So, the third complex has:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ fruits}
   \]
3. **7-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   7 \times 50 = 350 \text{ fruits}
   \]
4. **8-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
5. **9-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old avocado tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
   \[
   20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ fruits}
   \]

Now, let's find out how many fruits the 8-year-old tree produces. According to the problem, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits:
\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ fruits}
\]

Next, we sum up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
\]

Adding these together:
\[
50 + 150 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 350 = 550
\]
\[
550 + 800 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 0 = 1350
\]
\[
1350 + 1000 = 2350

To find 1/5 of $100, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Next, we add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation \( R = 4B \) to get \( R = 4(Y - 7) \).

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money, so we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Since Ronnie gave the same amount to their little sister, he also gave $3. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Determine the distribution of the paint:**
   - Half of the mural is yellow.
   - The remaining half of the mural is divided equally among red, white, and purple paint.

3. **Calculate the amount of yellow paint:**
   Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining amount of paint:**
   The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. Therefore, the amount of paint used for these three colors is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

5. **Determine the amount of red paint:**
   The remaining 6 pints of paint are divided equally among red, white, and purple. Therefore, the amount of red paint is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the number of pints of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"To find out how many clouds Alice counted in total over the five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds she saw each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the number of clouds counted each day:
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

Let's add these step by step:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]
\[ 21 + 24 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 48 = 93 \]

So, the total number of clouds Alice counted over the five days is:
\[ \boxed{93} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \]

So, the special size box contains:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since you use 1 pod per cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles you can run for $1:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, you can run \(\boxed{10}\) dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box."

   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of it on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the number of days before the chalk is recycled:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\).
   - The chalk after \(n\) days can be expressed as \(C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n\).
   - We need to find the smallest \(n\) such that \(C_n < 2\) inches.

3. **Set up the inequality and solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2
   \]
   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75}
   \]
   \[
   (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11}
   \]

4. **Solve the inequality using logarithms:**
   \[
   \log((0.8)^n) < \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]
   \[
   n \log(0.8) < \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)
   \]
   \[
   n > \frac{\log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\log(0.8)}
   \]

5. **Calculate the values:**
   \[
   \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.1461
   \]
   \[
   \log(0.8) \approx -0.0969
   \]
   \[
   n > \frac{-0.1461}{-0.0969} \approx 1.51
   \]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14000

Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date. So, we need to find out how much milk that is:

Amount of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Since the milk was returned, Mr. Marcellus gets a refund for the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that passed the expiry date.

Cost of the returned milk = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is $5600."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]

Distribute the 3 on the left side:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, let's determine how many books Bob can buy with the total amount of money he has. Since he can buy 100 books for $500, we can calculate the number of sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000.

\[ \text{Number of sets of 100 books} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Since each set of 100 books is bought for $500, and he can buy 54 sets, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the money is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picked up the two apples.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton put one apple in his pocket.
   - He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Newton picked up these 5 apples.
   - He put all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining one apple at the tree.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (which were 4, since he put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 at the tree).
   - He went home to make a pie.

Now, let's count the apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples.
- After the first action, he picked up 5 more apples, but he only kept 1, so he added 1 to his pocket.
- After the second action, he picked up 4 more apples and added them to his pocket.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:
\[ 1 \text{ (from the first action)} + 4 \text{ (from the second action)} = 5 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of 50 kg bags needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bags needed.**

The total weight of coal ordered is 850 kg, and each bag contains 50 kg. So, the number of bags required is:
\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each bag costs $18, and Ali needs 17 bags. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[
\boxed{306}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Therefore, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, Kate needs to buy:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas}\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

First, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He ran 3 miles each of these days:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. He ran 5 miles each of these days:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days together:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the net gain of snowballs per 15 minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour (60 minutes).
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time needed to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - We need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to get 60 snowballs.
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3 to find the number of 15-minute intervals: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert the time into hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

So, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. So, they ordered \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. Let's re-evaluate the bandages used and ordered:

- At the end of the second day, they had 34 bandages.
- They ordered 100 bandages on the third day.
- They used 25 bandages on the third day.
- Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)

Since they had 78 bandages left, it means they must have started with fewer bandages initially. Let's correct the initial bandages:

- If they had 78 bandages at the end of the third day, and they used 25 bandages and ordered 100, then before these actions, they had \(78 + 25 - 100 = 3\) bandages at the end of the second day.
- At the end of the second day, they had 34 bandages, so before using 28 bandages, they had \(34 + 28 = 62\) bandages at the end of the first day.
- At the end of the first day, they had 12 bandages after using 38 and ordering 50, so before these actions, they had \(62 - 50 + 38 = 50\) bandages at the start of the first day.

Thus, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the haircut. The cost per inch of haircut is $30, and May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, which means 2 inches were cut off.

The cost for the haircut is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 \]

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is:
\[ \$60 + \$40 = \$100 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$100 \]"
"First, let's calculate Jen's weekly earnings from her hourly rate:

- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- She works 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her weekly earnings from her hourly rate are:
\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

   - Earnings from laundry: \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \)

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   - Jason cleaned his room once.
   - He earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
   - Earnings from cleaning his room: \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \)

3. **Earnings from taking the trash to the curb:**
   - Jason took the trash out twice.
   - He earns $0.75 for each time he takes the trash out.
   - Earnings from taking the trash: \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \)

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   - Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times.
   - He earns $0.50 for each time he empties the dishwasher.
   - Earnings from emptying the dishwasher: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \)

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[ 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, ten sharks would have:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. The number that came in first is 50, so 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Second Day:**
- He planted 10 more White Oak trees than he did on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
- He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy had 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Total initial eyeshadow colors:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors from palettes} + 18 \text{ colors from sets} = 26 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, which had 4 colors.
     \[
     26 \text{ colors} - 4 \text{ colors} = 22 \text{ colors}
     \]

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and Amy uses up half of them.
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ colors}}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}

"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Mattison's height = 60 inches.
2. His house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The first floor's ceiling height is 3 times his height.

Now, let's calculate each part:

1. Height of the house = 7 * Mattison's height = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
2. Height of the first floor's ceiling = 3 * Mattison's height = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor's ceiling from the total height of the house:

Height of the roof from the second floor's floor = Total height of the house - Height of the first floor's ceiling
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches.

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \( 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles of the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, let's calculate the amount of the loan John gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is worth $250,000.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 40\% \times 250,000 = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 60\% \times 100,000 = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

   Total earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram
   Total earnings = 128 × 0.50 = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To calculate this, we can simplify the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, it removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[ 3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is:
\[
\boxed{29}

"First, let's calculate the total number of water balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs with 30 balloons in each pack. So, the total number of balloons is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of medicine for one dose.

For one dose:
- Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She uses 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, the total amount of medicine for one dose is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ 448 \, \text{mL} \]"
"First, let's determine the capacity of each class in John's school. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.

To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacities together:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ 150 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300.

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months.

\[ \text{Total paid in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid in 11 months from the total amount he needs to return to find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month.

\[ \text{Amount to be paid in the twelfth month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the problem step by step.

"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost increases by 1.5 times the original cost.

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. Therefore, the cost per year for 5 years is:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

So, for 5 years, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit is $5. Therefore, the cost per year for 3 years is:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, for 3 years, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 by 8:
\[ 40 \div 8 = 5 \text{ groups} \]

\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and the roof frames separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the wooden tables:
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the total cost for the tables is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the roof frames:
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.
- So, the total cost for the roof frames is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the tables and the roof frames to find the total amount Ali has to pay:
- Total cost = Cost of tables + Cost of roof frames
- Total cost = \( 80 + 20 = 100 \) dollars.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"First, we need to calculate the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply 35 inches by 5:

\[ 35 \, \text{inches/window} \times 5 \, \text{windows} = 175 \, \text{inches} \]

Next, Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 350 \, \text{inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. **Cost for the first 16 minutes:**
   - The cost per minute for the first 16 minutes is $0.25.
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) dollars.

2. **Cost for the remaining minutes:**
   - The total call duration is 36 minutes, so the remaining minutes after the first 16 minutes = \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
   - The cost per minute for the remaining 20 minutes is $0.20.
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of the call:**
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is **$8**."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by isolating the variable. First, add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure with the 20% discount.

The basic manicure costs $35, and the pedicure costs $40. The total cost before the discount is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

With a 20% discount, the amount of the discount is:
\[ 75 \times 0.20 = 15 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

Next, we need to add the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (assuming she has 10 nails on each hand). The cost of nail art per nail is $3, so the total cost for nail art on both hands is:
\[ 10 \times 3 \times 2 = 60 \]

Adding this to the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from each magazine and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year:
   \[
   3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues}
   \]

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \[
   1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues}
   \]

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \[
   4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the issues:
\[
36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has, and \( Sh \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has, we can write:
   \[
   S = Sh - 12
   \]
   Since \( S = 27 \), we can substitute 27 for \( S \):
   \[
   27 = Sh - 12
   \]
   Solving for \( Sh \):
   \[
   Sh = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
   So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

3. We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If we let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has, we can write:
   \[
   Sh = K + 8
   \]
   Since \( Sh = 39 \), we can substitute 39 for \( Sh \):
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]
   Solving for \( K \):
   \[
   K = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Therefore, Kim has \(\boxed{31}\) paintings."
"First, let's calculate the price of the toy after the 80% increase in December.

The original price in November was $40. An 80% increase means the price went up by 80% of $40.

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]

So, the new price in December is:

\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Next, in January, the price decreased by 50%. A 50% decrease means the price is now 50% of the December price.

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after the discount in January is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 lessons at his standard rate.

The standard rate is $80 per hour. Therefore, for 4 lessons:
\[ 4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per lesson} = \$320 \]

Next, let's determine the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the veteran's rate is:
\[ 100\% - 25\% = 75\% \text{ of the standard rate} \]
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.75 \times \$80 = \$60 \]

Now, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 2 lessons with a veteran:
\[ 2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per lesson} = \$120 \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's determine how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after Walter ate some is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the problem using a simple equation. Let's denote the number of novels she wrote this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, the 9 novels she wrote last year are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she wrote this year. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms."
"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. So, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

"First, let's determine the cost of the beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ 50 \text{ cents} \]

Final answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions for both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we determine how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she got correct on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get correct:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for blueberry cubes:

\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

"To find the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so they have 4 flashlights.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in total.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. So, the number of rooms with small candles is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, the number of rooms with medium candles is also \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**
   - Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get \(20 + 36 = 56\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many pink candies there are, we first need to determine the number of each type of candy given in the problem.

1. **Red Candies**: The problem states there are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: The problem states there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of orange candies is:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: The problem states there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. Therefore, the number of yellow candies is:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, orange, and yellow candies to find out how many candies are accounted for:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is:
\[
\boxed{43}
\]"
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of each and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the hotel:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Cost of the bus travels:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus travels is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

So, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during her trip."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Initially, Dallas has:

\[ 21 \text{ marbles} \]

After dropping 4 marbles, Dallas has:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

However, the problem states that Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means the 21 marbles already account for the drop. So, we don't need to add the 4 marbles back.

Now, let's find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla. Initially, Mazie had 52 marbles. After giving some to Dallas and Darla, she has 0 marbles left (since the problem doesn't mention her keeping any). Therefore, the total number of marbles given to Dallas and Darla is 52.

Since Dallas has 21 marbles, the number of marbles given to Darla is:

\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \]

So, Mazie gave Darla:

\[ \boxed{31} \] marbles."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed consumed by Dexter's pigs in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total feed consumption over a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

"To find the total age of all the siblings, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
2. All 3 sisters are 16 years old.
3. One brother is 12 years old, and this is half the age of the older brother.

First, we need to find the age of the older brother. Since the 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the older brother's age as follows:
\[ \text{Age of the older brother} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- The total age of the 3 sisters is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \).
- The total age of the 2 brothers is \( 12 + 24 = 36 \).

Adding these together gives us the total age of all the siblings:

So, the total age of all these siblings is 84."
"First, let's calculate the total time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Since she does this every day, in a week (7 days), she spends:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 210 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly meditation time into hours:

\[ 210 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3.5 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, so in a week, she spends:

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. If he sells half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy, we can calculate the total amount he would earn as follows:

1. Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and the other 6 at $7 each.
2. The earnings from the first 6 toy soldiers would be \(6 \times 5 = 30\) dollars.
3. The earnings from the other 6 toy soldiers would be \(6 \times 7 = 42\) dollars.
4. Adding these amounts together, the total earnings would be \(30 + 42 = 72\) dollars.

So, if Matthew agrees to the offer, he would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes while the dog continues to dig new ones. Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes a day, so the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes for Nate to fill in all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

Final answer:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. So, we calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference between the average enrollment at Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of test tubes Igor gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   \[
   \text{Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the number of beakers Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
   - Since the total number of items on the lab bench is 29, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Determine the number of beakers Igor lost:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered 5 beakers.
   \[
   \text{Number of beakers lost} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the final number of screws left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs in the second basket. Since the second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, and the first basket has 10 eggs, the second basket has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) eggs.
2. Add the number of eggs in both baskets together. The first basket has 10 eggs and the second basket has 20 eggs, so the total number of eggs is \(10 + 20 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30."
"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises \(430 + 320 = 750\) dollars.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises \(300 + 400 = 700\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all four girls:

\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

So, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how far Aaron ran. According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 1 mile. If Aaron took 16 minutes for 2 miles, then the time per mile for Aaron is:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile would be twice that of Aaron's:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Vanessa} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles, the total time she took to complete her part of the race is:

\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He has 6 feet of new line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line needed} - 6 \text{ feet of line he has} = 594 \text{ feet of line to buy} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals each night, and each meal costs $5.
- So, the cost of the meals per night is \(2 \times 5 = \$10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Therefore, the total cost per night is \(10 + 5 = \$15\).

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for all reservations per night is:
\[6 \times 15 = \$90\]

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total cost for the week is:
\[90 \times 2 = \$180\]

Therefore, the total amount they make in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find out the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price of each watermelon is $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

James is twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find out how old John was when James was born. Since James is currently 18 and John had James when he was 19, John's current age is:
\[ 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we need to determine the age of John's youngest son. The problem states that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. Since John is currently 37, his youngest son's current age is:
\[ 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old} \]

Finally, we need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

**Final Answer:**
5"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off.

The discount amount is:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total cost for the mechanic's work is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of chickens.
- \( K \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by 4:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza."
