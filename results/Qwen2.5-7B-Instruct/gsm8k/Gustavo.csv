"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts.

3 bolts"
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 3 meals a day, so each chicken eats:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Step 2: Wendi has 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for all the chickens is:
\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Step 3: The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 4: Subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal:
\[ 180 \text{ cups/day} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{140}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, where every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- Kylar will buy 8 glasses at the regular price of $5 each.
- Kylar will also buy 8 glasses at the discounted price of $3 each.

The total cost can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = (8 \times 5) + (8 \times 3) \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 24 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

The final numerical answer is:
260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = 0.60 * 200 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time for the return trip = 4 hours.
     - Time spent driving after the first 2 hours and the 0.5 hours = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered in the last 1.5 hours = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in the first 2 hours (standstill) = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered in the next 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered in the last 1.5 hours = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the respective rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate the earnings for each part:

- Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year from selling lemons:
\[ \text{Net Profit per Year} = (7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon}) - \$3 \]
\[ \text{Net Profit per Year} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the total net profit to equal or exceed the initial cost of $90:
\[ \text{Total Net Profit} = n \times \text{Net Profit per Year} \]
\[ 90 = n \times 7.5 \]

Now, solve for \(n\):
\[ n = \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ n = 12 \]

So, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners, and we know this is equal to 5.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Next, we find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:
   - 20 - 4 = 16 students

3. Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
   - 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Now, we find out how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students

5. Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we need to find the profit for each option. Profit is calculated as the final value minus the initial value.

1. **Profit from jewelry:**
   - Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Profit from electronic gadgets:**
   - Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the jewelry yields a higher profit.

The final profit from the jewelry purchase is $125."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her weekly earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs, and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings from teaching:
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.

Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from coaching:
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.

Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week

Now, let's add her weekly earnings from both jobs to get her total weekly earnings:
Total weekly earnings = $700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1150/week

Finally, to find her annual salary, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:
Annual salary = $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Her annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day.
2. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one week.
3. Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
4. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire eats 3 eggs every day.

Step 2: There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Step 3: In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 4: Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Final answer:

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to cover the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent on the first 6 miles.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to cover the last 6 miles.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Total time required for an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Time already spent on the first 6 miles:
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Remaining time to cover the last 6 miles:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Step 4: Required speed for the remaining 6 miles:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange and pineapple drinks separately, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

3. **Account for the spill:**
   - We spill 1 liter of the orange drink, which means we lose \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 1 liter of water (since the drink is two-thirds water).
   - Amount of water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 1 \) liter = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters ≈ 0.67 liters.

4. **Calculate the remaining water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters - \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drinks:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. 5 packs of milk: 5 * $3 = $15
3. 4 apples: 4 * $1.50 = $6
4. Let the number of boxes of pizza be \( x \). Each box costs $8.50, so the total cost for the pizza is \( 8.50x \).

The total cost is the sum of all these items, which equals $50. So we can write the equation:

\[ 12 + 15 + 6 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ 33 + 8.50x = 50 \]

Subtract 33 from both sides:

\[ 8.50x = 17 \]

Divide both sides by 8.50:

\[ x = \frac{17}{8.50} \]

\[ x = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

After 60 days, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{\$16.00}\) on ice cream."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between these two points on his trip.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip, which means it was at mile 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between these two mile markers:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair of heels costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x = 9\) into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, to find the average of these guesses, we add them together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."

"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can determine how many jewels Aaron has. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. 

The final numerical answer is:
23"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Final numerical answer:
9"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 13 lego sets.
2. He sells each lego set for $15.
3. He buys 8 video games for $20 each.
4. After buying the video games, he has $5 left.

First, we calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling the lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15 \text{ per lego set} = \$195 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times \$20 \text{ per video game} = \$160 \]

Now, we determine how much money John has after buying the video games:
\[ \$195 - \$160 = \$35 \]

Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, we can confirm that the remaining money is consistent with the problem statement:
\[ \$35 - \$5 = \$30 \text{ (which is the amount spent on video games)} \]

The question asks how many lego sets John still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ 0 \]

Final numerical answer:
0"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance he runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that the total distance he runs in a week is 60 miles. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a period of 6 hours. Therefore, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

To find the total distance she can travel, we calculate the distance for each activity and sum them up:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since a 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \) calories per gram.
   - To find out how many grams you can eat with 200 calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram: \( \frac{200}{4.17} \approx 48 \) grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She purchased a package of Post-it notes (let's call this number \( x \)).
3. At work, she used 220 post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet long, which is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained:
48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

From 1 to 4 PM, Tom travels for 3 hours at a rate of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, for the return trip, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. The time \(T\) it takes to travel back can be calculated using the formula:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed}} \]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[ T = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight to be removed by the toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires * $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

\(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. The available weight for the boxes is \(5000 - 3755 = 1245\) pounds.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is \(1245 \div 15 = 83\).

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays $140 per month for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than $140 per month for 6 months.

Let's calculate each part:

1. First half of the year:
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = \$140 \]
\[ \text{Number of months} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Total for first half} = \$140 \times 6 = \$840 \]

2. Second half of the year:
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = \$140 - (10\% \times \$140) \]
\[ \text{Monthly cost} = \$140 - \$14 = \$126 \]
\[ \text{Number of months} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Total for second half} = \$126 \times 6 = \$756 \]

Now, we add the totals for both halves of the year to get the total amount paid for the year:
\[ \text{Total for the year} = \$840 + \$756 = \$1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full 12-gallon tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency using the information given:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.

The fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon) is:
\[ \text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Gallons of Gas Used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we use this fuel efficiency to find out how far she can travel on a full 12-gallon tank:
\[ \text{Distance on Full Tank} = \text{Fuel Efficiency} \times \text{Tank Capacity} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim spends 2 hours watching TV each time and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So, each session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading.

"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. Each school has sent 2 teams (girls' and boys' basketball teams).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school has also sent 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people sent by one school is:
- Total people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
- Total people = 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people

"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money she makes in a week:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total amount from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

Total from brownies = 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

Next, let's calculate the total amount from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

Total from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the totals from both items to find the overall amount raised:
Total amount raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecakes
Total amount raised = $129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment.
3. Calculate the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment.
The interest rate is 2% per month.
Total interest = $750 * 2% * 3 = $750 * 0.02 * 3 = $45

Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $45 = $795

Step 4: Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

Therefore, Shiela will pay $265 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from each type of flower:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we can find the total square footage of the sandcastle by adding the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days and then determine how many 110-cup bags are needed.

First, we know that for the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food for the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the amounts of dog food for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 550 cups of dog food. We do this by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we compare the two costs to find the difference:

1. Cost with packages of 3: $15.00
2. Cost with packages of 2: $9.00
3. Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so together they got:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 + \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = \frac{24}{6} + \frac{24}{6} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Then a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

The total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, we can find \( W \) by substituting \( L \) back into the first equation:
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years:

1. After the first year (6th year of service):
   - New salary = Initial salary + 10% of initial salary
   - New salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New salary = $600 + $60
   - New salary = $660

2. After the second year (7th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New salary = $660 + $66
   - New salary = $726

3. After the third year (8th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New salary = $798.60

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18."
"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad one child will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children.
4. Add the amounts from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: One child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 2: The total amount of potato salad for the 20 adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 3: The total amount of potato salad for the 5 children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 4: Adding the amounts from steps 2 and 3 gives:

"Let's denote the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time before the diet change was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee's current time is 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. After his diet change, his speed improved by 10%. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. We can calculate his new time as follows:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 \times 0.90 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Final answer:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 \) (the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the cars that drove through in the second 15 minutes).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box, then calculate its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side). So, the inner dimensions of each box will be:

- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:

\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = 3 \, \text{inches} \times 4 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \]
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = 24 \, \text{cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5:

- 2 / 0.5 = 4 episodes

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To calculate the final cost after the cashback reward, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Let's do the math:

1. Total cost of 10 gallons = 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00
2. Total cashback for 10 gallons = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00
3. Final cost after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final cost of the gas after the cashback reward is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total eaten = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we need to find out how many feet Julia rows to the shore. We know that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this journey. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

So, the boat takes on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reaches the shore.

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

1. Cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

2. Cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

3. Total cost of all the lumber:
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. Revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards:
   - She sells 10 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $10.
   - New price per 2x4x10 board = $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15.
   - Total revenue for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

2. Revenue from selling the 4x4x10 boards:
   - She sells 5 boards at the new price, which is 50% higher than the original price of $16.
   - New price per 4x4x10 board = $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24.
   - Total revenue for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

3. Total revenue from selling all the lumber:
   - Total revenue = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles on the first day was:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary was \( L \), then Adrien's salary four years ago was:
   \[ L \times (1 + 0.30) = 1.30L \]
   Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can set up the equation:
   \[ 1.30L = 40,000 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. Now, we can calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

To find out how many sheets he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a month by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is:

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

They have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept:
8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

Over the two days, she slept:
6 + 6 = 12 hours.

For the rest of the week (Tuesday to Sunday, excluding the first two days and Monday), she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 3 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, or Sunday, depending on how you count), so she slept:
7 + 7 + 7 = 21 hours for the rest of the week.

Adding all the hours together:
8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 21 (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday/Sunday) = 41 hours.

Sadie slept a total of 41 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she covers:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (the package she bought plus the package her husband bought).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day.
2. Calculate the total revenue from patients.
3. Calculate the total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Total time in minutes = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

2. **Total revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 an hour to patients.
   - Total revenue = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

3. **Total cost to the hospital for the doctors' time:**
   - The hospital pays the doctors $150 an hour.
   - Total cost = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Using the first relationship, we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Using the second relationship, we can express W in terms of B: W = 2B. Since B = 2Q, we can substitute to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now we can substitute W and B in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, costing $2.
- Eggs are a food item, costing $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, costing $3.
- Cups are non-food items, costing $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, costing $4.

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
$3 (light bulbs) + $3 (cups) + $4 (roach traps) = $10.

Now, we need to calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1.

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
$10 (non-food items) + $1 (tax) = $11.

Next, we add the cost of the food items:
$2 (milk) + $3 (eggs) = $5.

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the cost of the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (12 months), he can harvest 12 / 3 = 4 times.

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per harvest = 100 pineapples/hectare
- Number of harvests in a year = 4
- Total pineapples in a year = 100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests = 400 pineapples/hectare

Since John has 10 hectares:
- Total pineapples in a year = 400 pineapples/hectare * 10 hectares = 4000 pineapples

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set) = 2125 pieces.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 pieces in total."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the second 6 hours. So, 15 bees from the first 6 hours plus the 60 bees that left in the third 6 hours return in the last 6 hours.

Therefore, the total number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 15 (from the first 6 hours) + 60 (from the third 6 hours) = 75 bees.

Final numerical answer:
75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final numerical answer:
16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
- Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time between the winner (Steve) and the loser (Tim) is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.

4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid to find the change.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
Total number of cookies = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Each cookie costs $0.10.
Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the change.
Carl pays with a $10 bill.
Change = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries before the ants took the last one were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x - 30}{3} = 6 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]

Then, we add 30 to both sides:
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
3 days * 1 hour/class * 3 classes/day = 9 hours

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Adding these together gives his total weekly class hours:
9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours per week

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply his weekly hours by the number of weeks:
17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total banana consumption for each type of ape over that period and then sum them up.

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so the total distance he runs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{yards} \times 15 = 3000 \, \text{yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is:

\[ 80 \, \text{yards} \times 34 = 2720 \, \text{yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Since Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, the difference in the distance they run is:

\[ 3000 \, \text{yards} - 2720 \, \text{yards} = 280 \, \text{yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each:

- Anakin's total: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Locsin's total: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

Adding the totals together, the combined total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 months / 2 months per increase = 18 increases

The price increases by 20% each time, which means it is multiplied by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20) each time. After 18 increases, the price will be the original price multiplied by 1.20, 18 times. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$20 * (1.20)^{18}$

Now, let's calculate this:

$20 * (1.20)^{18} = 20 * 10.063129 = 201.26258$

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price after 36 months is:

$201.26

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $201.26."

- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
One red car costs $4.
An action figure costs $5.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
Since each red car costs $4, the total cost for 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the action figures:
Since each action figure costs $5, the total cost for 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, let's add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 \text{ (red cars)} + 15 \text{ (action figures)} + 15 \text{ (doll)} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of all the toys is:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - If she hires the accountant, she spends $90.
   - If she does her taxes herself, she loses $105 in potential income.

4. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of hiring accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more.

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes to peel all the potatoes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds to cut all the potatoes.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:
- \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cut the potatoes:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, which is given as 200. So we can write:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So the number of red roses, \( R \), is:
\[ R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Final answer: Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they run in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they run in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they run in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, which means Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples:

20 (mom's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 apples.

They both picked a total of 30 apples."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
4. The total straw distributed is 160 pieces.

First, we need to find out how much straw was used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\)
- For the rabbits: \(20 \text{ pieces}\)

So, the straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

This means the straw used for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\).

Since these 15 rats are in 3 cages, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 5."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final Answer:**
$106.12"
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of tickets**: They spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
2. **Cost of food**: They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. **Cost of rides**: They went on 2 different rides which cost $33 each, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost of tickets: $20.25
- Total cost of food: $15.75
- Total cost of rides: $66

Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 (the number of friends):

Cost per person = $102 / 3 = $34

So, each of them paid $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, so the net increase in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

2. He starts with 50 trees.

3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

4. After 10 years, the total number of trees before any die is \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

6. The number of trees left after 30% die is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

Step 1: Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
- Josie has 10 acres.
- Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Step 2: Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.
- Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
- Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem into parts:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches = 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for omelets = 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:

"To get an average of 93 over six tests, Brinley needs to have a total of \(93 \times 6 = 558\) points across all six tests, because the average is the total sum of scores divided by the number of tests.

Brinley's current total from the first five tests is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

To find out what she needs on the sixth test, we subtract her current total from the required total:

\(558 - 438 = 120\).

However, Brinley can remove her lowest score from the first five tests before calculating the average. The lowest score among 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 is 71.

So, if Brinley removes 71 from her total, her new total will be \(438 - 71 = 367\).

To achieve an average of 93, the new total including the sixth test score (let's call it \(x\)) should be:

\(367 + x = 558\).

Solving for \(x\):

\(x = 558 - 367 = 191\).

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 191 on the sixth test to get an average of 93, after removing her lowest score. 

Final numerical answer:

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
   \[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

2. The problem states that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
   \[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

3. Twenty dozen cups is equal to \(20 \times 12 = 240\) cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the 240 cups by 240:
   \[ \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs after babysitting.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes: 2 pairs at $20 each = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. Calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time: 4 * $5 = $20

3. Calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
   - Let's say she mows the lawn \( x \) times, earning $4 each time: \( 4x \)

4. Calculate how much money Sara has before she starts mowing the lawn:

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she promised to return, which is the borrowed amount plus 10% of the borrowed amount.

1. Calculate the total amount to be returned:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \$2000 + (10\% \times \$2000) = \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

2. Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months:
\[ \text{Total paid} = \$165 \times 12 = \$1980 \]

3. Calculate the remaining balance:
\[ \text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total paid} = \$2200 - \$1980 = \$220 \]

Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \$220 \]"

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which means her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Total cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - The registration fee for each car is $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."

"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 * 7 = 63 cherry tomatoes.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 / 3 = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to grow enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen by mixing the ink.

Let's calculate how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:

- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen.
- After making 1 new pen, he has 24 pens left (25 - 5 + 1 = 24).
- He can use 4 more pens to make another new pen, and he will have 23 pens left (24 - 5 + 1 = 23).
- He can continue this process until he can no longer make a new pen with the remaining pens.

We can set up a loop to calculate the total number of pens:

- Start with 25 pens.
- Subtract 5 pens and add 1 new pen until he can't make a new pen anymore.

Let's do the math:

1. Start with 25 pens.
2. After the first cycle: 25 - 5 + 1 = 21 pens.
3. After the second cycle: 21 - 5 + 1 = 17 pens.
4. After the third cycle: 17 - 5 + 1 = 13 pens.
5. After the fourth cycle: 13 - 5 + 1 = 9 pens.
6. After the fifth cycle: 9 - 5 + 1 = 5 pens.
7. After the sixth cycle: 5 - 5 + 1 = 1 pen.

At this point, he can't make a new pen because he only has 1 pen left, which is not enough to make another new pen.

So, the total number of pens he ends up with is the initial 25 pens plus the 6 new pens he made:

25 + 6 = 31 pens.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends 10 pages a week.
3. Since Mike is pen pals with 3 people, the total number of pages he receives in a week is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) pages.
4. Mike responds in kind, so he also writes 30 pages a week in response.
5. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(30 + 30 = 60\) pages.
6. Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time he spends writing a week is \(60 \times 6 = 360\) minutes.

2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day.
- Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- Total cost for 5 weeks = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- Discount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
- Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid $27000."

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

From point 3, we know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

From point 2, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fees, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Finally, we add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- Total windows = bedroom windows + additional windows
- Total windows = \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, so the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
- The number of sterling silver beads is \(\frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

   - She pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

2. **Convert the working time to minutes:**
   - 2.5 hours = 2.5 * 60 minutes = 150 minutes.

3. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:**
   - 150 minutes / 10 minutes per interval = 15 intervals.

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.
   - Total earnings = 15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75.

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"After 3 rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points for all three players are:
22 + 18 + 43 = 83 points

Final numerical answer:
83"
"The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son will wash 8 oranges (since he is 8 years old), and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges (since he is 4 years old).

Together, they will wash \(8 + 4 = 12\) oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities he's done in the two days is:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner. So, the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. Now, we know the household consumes 2 kg of rice per day.

3. To find out how much rice is consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. Finally, to determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. 

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

Let's calculate the bids:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add up all the bids Carmen makes:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

So, the desk costs Carmen $900."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Mileage Charges:**
   - Distance to work: 30 miles
   - Round trip: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Daily mileage: 60 miles
   - Days per week: 5
   - Weeks per year: 50
   - Total annual mileage: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total annual mileage cost: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

2. **Monthly Bonuses:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Months per year: 12
   - Total annual bonus: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

3. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Total annual cost = Total annual mileage cost + Total annual bonus
   - Total annual cost = $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's the reasoning:

- Each sheet of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.
- For a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 / 4 = 8 sheets of paper to print all the pages.
- However, since each sheet of paper is folded in half, you only need half the number of sheets to get the full number of pages. 

So, the final numerical answer is:

16"
"Annika started with $50.

She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount left is:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 people

"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves left to be sold in the afternoon and evening is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since the loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is 5."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

To lose the same amount of weight that Joey does in a single week (2 pounds), Sandy will take 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

- An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
- An extra leg is grown every 5 days.

First, we calculate the number of extra arms grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]
So, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

Next, we calculate the number of extra legs grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]
So, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down Theo's expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of business suits:**

2. **Cost of suitcases:**
   - 3 suitcases at $50 each: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)

3. **Cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of a business suit: $100
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit: \(5 \times 100 = 500\)
   - Flight ticket cost: \(500 + 700 = 1200\)

4. **Total expenses so far:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 5 people in the family.
2. Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
3. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the three people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the remaining two people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs

Therefore, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times the age of Noah, so the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

Current population of Chile = 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

The population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

It also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments:

- \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

14 people show up for Martha's party."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought.

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of poles:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} \]

Substituting the given number of wires:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

This means that 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed can be calculated as follows:

30 (total people who stayed) - 22 (men who stayed) = 8 women who stayed.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine how many pencils are in the boxes that Jam has.

Jam has a total of 26 pencils, including 2 loose pencils. Therefore, the number of pencils in the boxes is:
26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils

Now, we know that Jam has 3 boxes and 24 pencils in total. To find out how many pencils are in each box, we divide the number of pencils in the boxes by the number of boxes:
24 pencils / 3 boxes = 8 pencils per box

Now, let's add the number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together:
Jam's pencils: 26
Meg's pencils: 46
Total pencils: 26 + 46 = 72 pencils

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we need to know how many pencils each box can hold. Since we know that each of Jam's boxes holds 8 pencils, we can assume that each box can hold 8 pencils. Therefore, the total number of boxes needed is:
72 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 9 boxes

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people on the bus then became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after these changes, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. 

Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

40 percentage points × 3 minutes per percentage point = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 minutes ÷ 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, which means they earned $1 for every $20 spent. So, they earned:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars in rewards} \]

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon applied twice the amount of the rewards off the price. Since they have $4 in rewards, the coupon applied:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

So, the amount they need to pay after applying the rewards and the coupon is:

\[ 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, the customer paid:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly rate: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ruined castles.
2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final numerical answer:
44"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

There are 4 people, so we divide the total number of guns by 4 to find out how many each would get if they shared equally:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Each of them would have 6 guns."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can multiply the amount of sugar required for each batch by the number of batches and then add the totals together.

For suckers:
30 ounces per batch × 8 batches = 240 ounces

For fudge:
70 ounces per batch × 1 batch = 70 ounces

Now, we add the two amounts together:
240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year:

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial investment is:
   \[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

2. The stock price increases by 50% in the first year, so the new price per share is:
   \[ \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

3. The value of all 8 shares after the first year is:
   \[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

Next, let's calculate the value of the shares after the second year:

1. The stock price decreases by 25% in the second year, so the new price per share is:
   \[ \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

2. The value of all 8 shares after the second year is:
   \[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + H = 60 \).
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows, so \( H = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the number of cows:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4 \times C + 2 \times H = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling with:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 (remaining balls) - 2 (caught balls) = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.

Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
2. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, we need to calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters and add it to the original 5000 meters.

First, calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, add this to the original distance:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson will run 6000 meters every day if he follows his coach's advice.

Since June typically has 30 days, we need to calculate the total distance Tyson would cover in June if he runs 6000 meters every day:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
180,000 meters."

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies/week

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in a bag:
36 cookies (total) - 27 cookies (consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference between the two daily revenues.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100%
   - Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they were making tractors."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, and then see how many friends can fit within her $90 budget.

First, let's calculate the cost for one person:
- One round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
- Total budget: $90
- Cost for Morgan: $30

Amount left for friends = $90 - $30 = $60

Now, we need to find out how many friends can be accommodated with the remaining $60. Since each friend also needs to pay $30, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per person:
- Number of friends = $60 / $30 = 2

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to the party."

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one complete trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, we calculate:
   \[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[ 3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50 \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[ 31 + x = 50 \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = 50 - 31 \]
   \[ x = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sara's current score is 8 points.
2. Erin's current score is three times Sara's score, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
3. Erin scored 14 points to reach her current score of 24 points.

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current score of 24 points.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 * 44 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost for picture frames = $1056
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198

The final numerical answer is:
$1198"
"The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400. If Ethan makes his own wallpaper, he saves 20% on the materials cost.

To find the savings:
20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, the cost after considering the savings would be:
$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan made his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the interest on the loan and the total amount she will pay back over the five months. 

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will pay back is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment Karan has to make is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Cho's time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Cho hiked = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Chloe's time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Chloe hiked = 9 km/h × 5 h = 45 km

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. The cost is given as $18. So, the profit from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups in:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:

- 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat would be 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00.
The cost of the cheese would be 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese would be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$50.00"
"Given that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:

Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

New total cannolis = Original cannolis + Additional cannolis
New total cannolis = 40 + 60
New total cannolis = 100

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so the new number of corns is:

New number of corns = Original corns - 40
New number of corns = 80 - 40
New number of corns = 40

Now, we can find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:

Combined total = New total cannolis + New number of corns
Combined total = 100 + 40
Combined total = 140

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 140."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog and then subtract that from the total steps he aimed to take.

Total steps aimed to take: 10,000 steps
Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (short walk with friend) = 6,000 steps
Steps left after the jog: 2,000 steps

Now, we can calculate the steps taken during the jog:

Total steps - Steps taken before the jog - Steps left after the jog = Steps taken during the jog
10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2,000 steps"
"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate:

9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 30 minutes to read the book. After reading, it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport:

60 minutes - 30 minutes (reading) - 10 minutes (travel) = 20 minutes

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. 

Toby will be 20 minutes early."
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments for May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Payment per employee per week: $15 * 40 hours = $600
- Total payment for May: 40 employees * $600/employee = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- Number of employees who left in June: 1/4 of 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining in June: 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Payment per employee per week: $600 (same as May)
- Total payment for June: 30 employees * $600/employee = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments for May and June.**

- Total payment for May and June: $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. The total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the first pack, so:

\[ 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the first pack and the second pack:

\[ \$400 + \$800 = \$1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1200 = 0.20 \times \$1200 = \$240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the first and second packs:

\[ \$1200 - \$240 = \$960 \]

Now, we add the cost of the finale firework:

\[ \$960 + \$150 = \$1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \$1110 \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night. To find out how many cookies she needs for 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of days:

2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies:

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. We can only work with the information given about the candles that smell like wet dog.

Given:
- Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles (which we can assume are the ones that might explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500 \]

Next, we calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are among the 1% that are expected to explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

Step 1: Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount on each blouse is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

The discount price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Step 2: Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses.
Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500.

Now, let's write an equation for the total number of apples gathered:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]

Joanne's apples are:

\[ 30 + 15 + x \]

Sister's apples are:

\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches big."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to add the money he received from the banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money from the banks is \(4000 + 8000 = 12000\) dollars.

Adding this to his initial capital of $5000, we get:

\[5000 + 12000 = 17000\]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital.

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

   \[ 6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48 \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96 \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of the total savings. The total savings is $6.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = J - 22 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 28 - T \]

Simplifying these equations:
\[ 2 = J - 22 \]
\[ 4 = 28 - T \]

Solving for \( J \) and \( T \):
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]
\[ T = 28 - 4 = 24 \]

However, we already know the original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, but based on the given conditions, it seems there's a misunderstanding since the original price of the jogger jeans is actually $22, not $24.

So, the correct original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the tattered jeans are $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

1. The 4 buses can each hold 60 employees, so the total capacity for the buses is:
   \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees

2. The 6 minibusses can each hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so the feeders she made attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $50 in spending cash and the cost of the ticket, which is $100, so the total money he has after selling the cards is $150.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. So, for 36 guests, half would be 18 guests, and these 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, which means 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.
3. The remaining 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, which means another 18 hotdogs.
4. In total, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.
5. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that each of the 40 guests would need 2 hotdogs, which totals 80 hotdogs.
6. Since the caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, the number of hotdogs needed exceeds the number prepared by 80 - 54 = 26 hotdogs.
7. Since each guest needs 2 hotdogs, the 26 short hotdogs would be enough for 26 / 2 = 13 guests to not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, 13 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, and he started with $5, we can calculate the remaining money as:
\[ 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can find out how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips and the remaining money from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions, so he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"If it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, then Bernadette's drive takes:

4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes

Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to add those 5 minutes to her travel time:

16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

21 minutes"
"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Now, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:
140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

80"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final numerical answer:
59"
"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which is:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Rozanne starts with 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
   = $576 / 48
   = $12

2. The total revenue from the flash sale:
   = Number of sneakers sold at the flash sale * Price per sneaker
   = 17 * $20
   = $340

3. The number of sneakers sold to the department store:

   = 31

4. The total revenue from the department store:
   = Number of sneakers sold to the department store * Price per sneaker
   = 31 * $25
   = $775

5. The total revenue:
   = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
   = $340 + $775
   = $1115

6. The profit:
   = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $1115 - $576
   = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket for any movie: $20
2. Super ticket includes popcorn and soda for $1 extra: $20 + $1 = $21
3. Regular ticket for any movie: $12
4. Regular ticket + popcorn + soda: $12 + P + $3 (where P is the regular price of popcorn)
5. You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.

So, the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is $2 more than the cost of the super ticket:

$12 + P + $3 = $21 + $2

Now, let's solve for P:

$12 + P + $3 = $23
$15 + P = $23
P = $23 - $15
P = $8

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
$8"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per balloon on the first day} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45 \]

2. The cost of filling each balloon increased by $20 two days later. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65 \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We can calculate this as:

\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 170 \times \$65 \]

4. Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5) = 10200 + 850 = 11050 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]
\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   15 \times 0.60 = 9
   \]
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 green cards.
3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   So, there are 39 yellow cards.

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[
15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies.

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80."
"To break in the new pair of shoes, Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week to achieve this goal in three weeks.

First, let's calculate the total number of days he will be walking:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Next, we divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend 20 minutes walking each day."
"To find out how many books each child got, we first need to determine the total number of books Sarah bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each book.

Total amount spent: $300
Cost per book: $15

Total number of books = Total amount spent / Cost per book
Total number of books = $300 / $15
Total number of books = 20

Now, we need to divide the total number of books equally among her 4 kids.

Number of books each child gets = Total number of books / Number of kids
Number of books each child gets = 20 / 4
Number of books each child gets = 5

Each child got 5 books."
"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

First, we find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This is given by the formula for the union of two sets:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Plane Tickets**: $5000 each for two people, so $5000 * 2 = $10,000.

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price is $1500 per day. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. So, the increased price per day is $1500 + (20% of $1500) = $1500 + ($1500 * 0.20) = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. For 3 days, the total hotel cost is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

3. **Total Cost**: Adding the plane tickets and the hotel cost, we get $10,000 + $5400 = $15,400.

The trip cost is $15,400."
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which means Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, Jasper has a total of \( 2 + 9 = 11 \) tubes of paint.

"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. 

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add their weights together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total they have earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on her player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to her player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, we calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for 1 pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (for the first pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after discounts / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, since she is at the top and the question does not specify any additional height from the other cheerleaders in the pyramid.

60 inches

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches. 

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

60 inches ÷ 12 = 5 feet

The height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."

"Let's denote the number of guests as \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs of the two venues are equal. Therefore, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:

"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars. This leaves Ali with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

Subtracting the amount used for dinner from the remaining money, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"If Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, that's equivalent to 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Double the time Rob takes would be 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time, so:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the amount of wool required for one set of winter wear for a single grandchild, and then multiply by the number of grandchildren.

For one grandchild:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one grandchild: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins

4. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is \(100 - 12 - 36 = 52\).
5. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\) problems.
6. After Wednesday, the number of problems left is \(52 - 13 = 39\).

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour together, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

After selling 132 loaves, the number of loaves left would be:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves.

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so the total number of loaves left would be:

68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the raisins equally among the three uses:**
   - Heather has 27 cups of raisins.
   - She wants to divide them equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.
   - Therefore, each use will get \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups of raisins.

2. **Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies:**
   - Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.
   - To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups of raisins, we divide 9 by \( \frac{3}{4} \).

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9}{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption.
2. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption after adding the new device will be:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]
3. The weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
4. The weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is:
   \[
   14 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2352 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
5. The weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
   \[
   2016 \text{ kW/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$3024
   \]
6. The weekly electric bill after adding the new device is:
   \[
   2352 \text{ kW/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$3528
   \]
7. The difference between the two weekly electric bills is:
   \[
   \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is \(\boxed{504}\)."
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be 5 times the rate of one person. So, 5 people can paint a whole house in 10/5 = 2 days.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is 2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

From point 2, we can say that Ophelia has \(C_O - 2\) sofas, where \(C_O\) is the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since we know Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:
\[C_O - 2 = 20\]
\[C_O = 22\]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

From point 3, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[3 \times 22 = 66\]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[66 - 2 = 64\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas:
\[20 + 64 = 84\]

Total number of chairs:
\[22 + 66 = 88\]

Total number of sofas and chairs:
\[84 + 88 = 172\]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \). The total cost equation is:

\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):

\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have $48. We need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $48. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $48 by $4:

\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

First, we know that for 6 out of the 8 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, the total hours for these 6 weeks is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he worked out for 5 hours each for 2 consecutive weeks. So, the total hours for these 2 weeks is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Additionally, he worked out for 6 hours in one week. So, the total hours for this week is:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[ 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, Jame's cousin will be 2 * 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

4. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55: 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

Now, to find the number of years that separate the age of the two now, we subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:

47 - 22 = 25

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is 25."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, the printer, and the 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the following equation to find the cost of the monitors:
\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the printer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) shells.

Let's calculate that:

4 * 60 = 240

So, the girls brought back 60 + 240 = 300 shells.

Since the girls were divided into two equal groups, each group of girls brought back half of the total number of shells the girls brought.

300 / 2 = 150

Each girl brought back 150 seashells.

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up: \(18 + 21 + 15 = 54\) vlogs.

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\(72 - 54 = 18\)

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings for the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings for the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Set the total monthly savings equal to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} \).
   - \( x = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."

"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Days per Week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 2 \times 5 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to Save}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{80}{40} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = 2 \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost of your lunch, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub first, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.

So, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of both subs to find the total cost of your lunch:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:
70"
"Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so:

\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ cubic inches} = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( x \).
2. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups.
3. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups.
4. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups, which means \( x = 4 \).

Now, we need to find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake. 

Juan currently drinks \( 5x \) cups, and he needs to reduce his intake to \( x \) cups. So, the reduction needed is:

\[ 5x - x = 4x \]

Since \( x = 4 \):

\[ 4x = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. 

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"The pet shop had 6 cages of rodents in total. 

3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs:
2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the sun is moving straight upward, we add this movement to the initial angle of the pyramid:

\[32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}\]

So, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

Final answer:
82 degrees"
"The first step is to determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs:

1 candle for the 12-year-old son + 1 candle for the 8-year-old son = 2 candles.

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, and he only needs 2 candles, he can buy a pack that contains 2 candles or less. However, since the candles are sold in packs of 5, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles.

The cost of one pack of 5 candles is $3. Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

$3.

So, the final numerical answer is:

$3."
"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/page pair}} \times 2 \text{ pages/page pair} = 70 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

\[ 70 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 170 \text{ pages} \]

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, that's 2 teeth * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."
"Richie scored 80 goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored:
80 - 20 = 60 goals

And since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna scored:
80 - 45 = 35 goals

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by each:
80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals

Therefore, all three teenagers scored a total of 175 goals."

Mitchell made $21 more than Liam that weekend."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days).
2. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $70 / 7 = $10 per day.
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. That's 4 days.
4. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10/day * 4 days = $40.
5. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he can buy is $40 / $5 = 8 action figures.
6. After Wednesday, he has $70 - $40 = $30 left.
7. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.
8. The total amount he can spend on plastic action figures is $30.
9. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is $30 / $2 = 15 action figures.
10. The total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is 8 (wooden) + 15 (plastic) = 23 action figures.

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value (20) plus half of the number (which is also 20) is divided by 5.
3. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). In this case, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the number.
\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Step 2: Add this value to the starting value and divide by 5.
\[ \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

The actual temperature is 468 degrees, and the intended temperature is 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is then:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means Maggie's oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in 520 degrees when the oven is 4% too hot.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. Since the oven is 4% too hot, the actual temperature will be 104% of the setting temperature. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill:
- They are paid $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Total water needed = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed = 8 * 100
Total water needed = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

Now, we add these three speeds together and divide by 3 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

**Final Answer: 318**"
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: $4 * 2 = $8 (since it's twice the cost of Amazon's shipping)
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

Step 1: The protein content in 100 grams of mushrooms is 3 grams. Therefore, in 200 grams, the protein content would be:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} \times 200 \text{ grams} = 6 \text{ grams} \]

Step 2: Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we need to find out how much protein he consumes in a week (7 days):
\[ 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 5 = 40 nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 5 = 30 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which is 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
40 (from quarters) + 30 (from dimes) + 14 (from nickels) + 3 (from pennies) = 87 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 87 gumballs.

87"
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he gets \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he gets \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

Total number of games = \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make in 12 hours. Ruiz makes 60 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, he makes:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa makes 90 pounds per hour, so in 12 hours, she makes:

\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the amounts together, the total amount of chocolates they made together is:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:

\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the original amount:

\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to calculate the earnings from each period and then sum them up.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he earned 15 cups * $0.50 = $7.50.
- Over four hours, he earned 4 hours * $7.50 = $30.00.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he earned 10 cups * $0.60 = $6.00.
- Over two hours, he earned 2 hours * $6.00 = $12.00.

Now, we add the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 2 miles and the tires rotate 725 times, we can find the number of rotations per mile:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = 725 \]

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:
\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 400 \times 725 = 290,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:
\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 290,000 \times 12 = 3,480,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{10,440,000}{3,480,000} = 3 \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ \text{Cost per washing in cents} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by dividing the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{20 \text{ cents}}{60 \text{ washings}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ cents} \approx 0.3333 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{0.33} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the given values, we can still calculate how much he would be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks for the remaining money, and Joe would not have any money left and would be short by $2.50, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \text{Joe will have } -2.50 \text{ left after the purchase.} \]

However, if we strictly follow the question's request for the remaining money, the answer would be:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$65,960 \]"
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so the total duration of the research is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The first 5 months cost $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000. So, the funding per month for the remaining months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 45 months, which is $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding up the meat consumed:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93,000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, let's break down the costs:

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators:

72 seats / 4 = 18 seats occupied by administrators

The remaining seats after the administrators are seated:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

54 seats / 3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats occupied by students

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

The physical therapy cost John $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

Now, let's find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left before giving any to his sister:

- Remaining gum: \( 20 - 6 = 14 \) pieces

Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- Gum given to sister: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces

Finally, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day:

- Remaining gum after giving to sister: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces

"To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount each coach spent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach:
- The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each.
- Total cost for baseballs = 9 * $3 = $27

Next, let's calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach:
- The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each.
- Total cost for basketballs = 8 * $14 = $112

Now, we find the difference between the amounts spent by the basketball coach and the baseball coach:
- Difference = $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden.

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of bloomed flowers, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ 200 \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

1. First, convert kb/s to Mb/s:
   - 1 Mb = 1000 kb
   - So, 20 kb/s = 20 / 1000 Mb/s = 0.02 Mb/s

2. Next, convert Mb/s to Mb/h:
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour)
   - So, 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day, so:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the first three days, so it pulled:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the number of cars pulled on the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

Total number of cars towed that week: 54"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times \$7,500 = \$75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$17,500}

"First, let's determine how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

\[ 100 \text{ riders} \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders can stay upright} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, so 40% must be men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \text{ riders} \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men can stay upright} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes.

The total cost for 10 classes is $60. If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can attend all 10 classes without the cost per class exceeding $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is:

\[ 10 - 0 = 10 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 10 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Sum the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel.

First, we know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes \(50 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ customers/week}\).
- Julie processes \(100 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 700 \text{ customers/week}\).

Finally, we add the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel:
\[350 \text{ customers/week} + 700 \text{ customers/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week}\]

The total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000

3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Original Monthly Salary} + (\text{Original Monthly Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (\$20,000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + \$1,000 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\text{New Monthly Salary}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{\$21,000}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$10,500 \]

Now, we calculate Tim's total monthly earnings including the bonus:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{New Monthly Salary} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$21,000 + \$10,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$31,500 \]

Finally, we calculate Tim's annual earnings:

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$31,500 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."

1. **Cost of suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.

The total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay, then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = Time to dig soil + Time to dig clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice the amount, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost for each hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

James paid $105."

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. The initial cost of the plane is $150,000.
2. The monthly cost for the hanger is $5,000.
3. The monthly cost for fuel is twice the hanger cost, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000.

The total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:
3 dollars"
"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

20% of $5 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds (since he uses 1 pound per day). Therefore, the cost of the coffee for a week is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys a donut for $2. 

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut together, we get:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost is:

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to A + Newspapers to C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's find the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and it lasts for 6 weeks. So, the total number of hours is:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total number of hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers, so we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to share the money equally."

"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. 

First, let's calculate the number of neutral days:
Total days - Good days - Bad days = Neutral days
30 - 12 - 8 = 10 neutral days

Now, we know the distribution of the first 24 days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 8 bad days
- Following 8 days: 10 neutral days

For the next 3 days, the mood is given as good, neutral, and good. So, we add these to the count of good days:
Good days from the first 24 days: 8
Good days from the next 3 days: 2 (since 2 out of 3 are good)

Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

So, the number of good days left in the month is 10."

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Final numerical answer:
12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. This means James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults, and then subtract the maximum load of the elevator from this total.

1. Calculate the total weight of the 9 adults:
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - There are 9 adults (Jack + 8 other adults).

   Total weight = 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg

2. Subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight:
   - Maximum load of the elevator = 700 kg
   - Total weight of the group = 720 kg

   Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum load
   Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

The group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each person has:

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \( \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes} \).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \).

Finally, we add the times for both halves of the lawn:

- Total time = 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin would be \( x + 7 \).

The other triplet is \( x \) years old, and the other twin is also \( x + 7 \) years old.

The combined ages of the four individuals are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ x + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4x + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 7.5 \]

So, the younger triplet is 7.5 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 14.5 years old."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost for four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. We already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, so the cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Now, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing the total cost of the four candies by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

So, each candy costs $0.30. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Determine how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. So, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}

"Let's break down the costs first:

1. The cost of the two vaccines is $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.
2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).
3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, \( x = 0.6 \times \text{total bill} \).

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ \text{Total bill} = $40 + x \]

Since \( x = 0.6 \times \text{total bill} \), we can substitute \( x \) in the equation:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.6 \times 40 + 0.6 \times x \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]
\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]
\[ 0.4x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60.

Now, we can find the total bill:
\[ \text{Total bill} = $40 + $60 = $100 \]

John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of 50 deer are bucks.
\[ 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks.

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points.
\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 8 point bucks.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Marta's points: 105

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:

400 - 255 = 145 points

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"To find out how many great-grandbabies will be at the family reunion, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own, so the number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own, so the number of great-grandbabies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is 27.

"To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with step 1:

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Next, step 2:

Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city is:
\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Now, step 3:

Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard. So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Finally, step 4:

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks she sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the capacity of Gary's truck can be found by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
\[ 11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald received 3 parts, so he got 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

**Final Answer: 9**"
"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production for the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate the total production in 48 hours:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production in 48 hours:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase. To find the discount amount:

Discount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:

Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

The final numerical answer is:

"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4/2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

**Final Answer: 4 scoops**"
"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she will have eaten:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces of candy, so after two weeks, Ginger will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy:

"To determine how much James saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking blueberries and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

1. **Cost of picking blueberries:**
   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound * Pounds picked)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 * 30)
   Total cost of picking = $20 + $45
   Total cost of picking = $65

2. **Cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound * Pounds
   Total cost at the store = $2.5 * 30
   Total cost at the store = $75

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each of the five friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.
2. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Next, we need to calculate how many slices were eaten by each group of friends:

3. Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a pizza is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) slices. Since there are three friends in this group, the total number of slices eaten by this group is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) slices.

4. The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a pizza is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) slices. Since there are two friends in this group, the total number of slices eaten by this group is \( 2 \times 9 = 18 \) slices.

5. The total number of slices eaten by all friends is \( 24 + 18 = 42 \) slices.

6. The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten, which is \( 60 - 42 = 18 \) slices.

"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as:

\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:

\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

"Given that Dora is 15 years old, we can calculate the ages of her father and mother as follows:

1. Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, if Dora is 15, her father's age is:
\[ 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

2. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, her mother's age is:
\[ 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:
\[ 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. Giant cubes: 3 cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces
2. Medium cubes: 7 cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces
3. Small cubes: 8 cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 4 ounces

Now, we add up the total water used:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left.

"To calculate how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times $0.10/\text{tomato} = $50/\text{day} \]

Now, let's calculate the weekly savings:
\[ $50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = $350/\text{week} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 34 large stickers left and 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 100 large buttons and 102 small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and each small sticker is worth one small button, the large buttons are already in the form of buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 100 large buttons + 102 small buttons = 202 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we can determine how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horses #2 and #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

"To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days, we need to break down her earnings for each day and then sum them up.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5, making her total for Monday \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Video game time = 1/3 * Remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time left for playing soccer is:

Soccer time = Remaining time - Video game time = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Soccer time / Total time) * 100

Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony had 50 pencils initially.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

So, Anthony gave 25 pencils to Brandon, leaving him with:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie, leaving him with:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony kept 10 pencils.

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Time = 6 hours

4. **Total time gone from home:**
   - Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time to drive back = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
276 wheels"

You have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

The total cost is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \), and the time she finishes the level as \( T_e \) seconds. For Ava, the corresponding values will be \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \) seconds.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
2. \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
3. \( T_a = T_e + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30(T_e - T_e) = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30(T_e - (T_e + 4)) = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(-4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = -25 \]

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). We know that Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish, and after buying more, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step. First, let's simplify the second equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):

\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, we add these two equations together to eliminate \( W \):

\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now that we have \( O = 13 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( W \):

\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature drops to 12 degrees during the night, Carson needs to raise the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

30% of $900 is calculated as:
0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.
Final amount = Total cost + Premium
Final amount = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders * 0.8 = 320 passed.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 700\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7
\]

Expressing this as a percentage:

\[
0.7 \times 100 = 70\%
\]

The school's overall pass rate is 70%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag contains 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has 2 bags.
   - Total number of glass chips = 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

2. **Calculate the total area of the mosaic Milo can make:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make 1 square inch of the mosaic.
   - Total area = Total number of glass chips / Number of chips per square inch
   - Total area = 144 chips / 12 chips/square inch = 12 square inches.

3. **Determine the dimensions of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.
   - Let the length of the mosaic be \( L \) inches.
   - The area of the mosaic is given by the formula: Area = Height * Length.
   - So, 12 square inches = 3 inches * \( L \) inches.

4. **Solve for the length \( L \):**
   - \( L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \).

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
   \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\(48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}\)

Final numerical answer:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after the additional order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies after the additional order: 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies

Candies sold: 150

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies."
"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the additional number of students that joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals picked:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, which uses up 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or lost is 18 + 3 = 21.

Subtracting the used and lost marshmallows from the original amount, we have 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since they want to make S'mores equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express the total amount of ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( s = 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( s = 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10z \]

Since the total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, we have:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil used:
\[ \text{Oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces."
"John buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. 

The total cost for the goats is: 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500
The total cost for the cows is: 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:

$1500 (goats) + $3000 (cows) = $4500

So, John spent a total of $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 48 cupcakes.

63 (total needed) - 48 (already has) = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars:

3. 20% of Joe's cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother:

4. Joe gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars to his mother.

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:

5. Joe initially had 40 cars.
6. After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars.
7. After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

To find the total time she walked in the two days, we add the hours from both days: 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of tasks John does in a week.
3. Calculate the total earnings for the week.

Step 1: Total number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the total number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Total number of tasks per week
Since John works 7 days a week, the total number of tasks per week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Step 3: Total earnings for the week
Each task pays $1.20, so the total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00

"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate the total production for the first three weeks and subtract it from the monthly production.

Total production for the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Total monthly production:
50,000 bars

Production in the fourth week:

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Time spent doing makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Total monthly time = Recording time + Writing time + Makeup time
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 8 hours + 360 minutes

To add the time, we need to convert the hours to minutes:
- 8 hours = 8 * 60 minutes = 480 minutes

So, the total monthly time in minutes is:
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $224.00

"First, let's determine how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times \$30.00 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's total savings:

\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

40 feet"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:

\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]

Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then the distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:

\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{2v} \times 4 = \frac{54}{2} \times 4 = 27 \times 4 = 108 \]

So, it will take the four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total, including the money in her purse, and how much she needs to reach the total cost of the laptop.

The total amount Erika needs to buy the laptop is $400. She still needs $50, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

This $350 includes the money she has in her purse, the $150 she was paid, and the $80 from her mom. So, we can set up the equation:

Money in purse + $150 + $80 = $350

Now, let's solve for the money in her purse:

Money in purse + $230 = $350
Money in purse = $350 - $230
Money in purse = $120

So, Erika has $120 in her purse."
"To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Adam has after slicing the apples.

Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the large apples is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, the total number of slices from the small apples is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

Adding the slices from the large and small apples together, we get the total number of slices:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

Adam then eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he ate from the total number of slices:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
15"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is a total of:

2 * $20 = $40

He spends $2 on each of the six squirt guns, so the total spent on squirt guns is:

6 * $2 = $12

He also spends $3 on each of the three packs of water balloons, so the total spent on water balloons is:

3 * $3 = $9

The total amount spent is the sum of the money spent on squirt guns and water balloons:

$12 + $9 = $21

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 8 (students good at English only) = 12 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (students good at math only) + 12 (students good at both math and English) = 17 students.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform by dividing the available time by the time each group takes:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then multiply it by the number of years.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest is:

\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) white shirts have collars.

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts with no collars.

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts with no buttons.

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X, so the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, so he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

To find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

Therefore, James pays on average $110 for each pair of shoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - So, the total cost is \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( G \) be the age of the person (you).
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( G = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( G = S + 2 \) or \( S = G - 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( G + B + S + M = 87 \).

Now, let's substitute the expressions for \( G \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Divide by 6:

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he has:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.
Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Total cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens for a total of $7000.

The final numerical answer is:

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by the boys is:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2 to find out how many glasses each boy sold:
18 glasses / 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5 glasses

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah is selling:
   - The rope is 20 meters long.
   - The price is $2 per meter.
   - Total cost = 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

2. Calculate the cost of the new rope Sarah plans to buy:
   - The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
   - Since Sarah is using the profit from selling the rope to buy the new one, we need to know the length of the new rope. However, the problem does not specify the length of the new rope. For the sake of this problem, let's assume Sarah wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.
   - Cost of the new rope = 20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30.

3. Calculate the profit Sarah makes from selling the rope:
   - Profit = Total cost of the rope - Cost of the new rope.
   - Profit = $40 - $30 = $10.

So, after Sarah buys the new rope, she will have $10 left over."
"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( M \).

From the information given, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So we can write the equation:
\[ M + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 18 - 10 \]
\[ M = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). So we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

First, let's calculate 20% of 50 microphones:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't be paired up. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired up is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals:
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
3. In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
4. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for her work, and we know that Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times, we can set up the equation for the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:

\[ 6x = 6 \]

From this, we can see that \( x = 1 \).

So, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) times, and in the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) times.

Now, let's calculate the total amount she earned from mowing lawns:

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is equivalent to half an adult's bowl (since 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls, 1 child bowl = 1/2 adult bowl).

Calvin has 2 adult bowls left for the children, and since each child's bowl is equivalent to 1/2 an adult bowl, we can calculate the number of child bowls as follows:

2 adult bowls * 2 (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls) = 4 child bowls

Calvin has 2 children, and there are 4 child bowls available. Therefore, each child can have:

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 180 minutes, there are:
     \[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total number of pieces of bologna can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month, so he drives a total of:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

3 tune-ups"
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total hours Bruce works in all these three days, we add the hours from each day:

5 (Tuesday) + 10 (Wednesday) + 8 (Thursday) = 23 hours

Therefore, Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit Kira bought = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

12 pieces are left."
"To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer.

1. There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means there are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) students playing volleyball.
3. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, which totals \(16 + 22 = 38\) students playing soccer.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56\]

So, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling lollipops.
2. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the profit.

First, let's calculate the total revenue. Each student sold 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Since each lollipop was sold for $0.8, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollipop} = \$240 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost. Each lollipop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollipop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means Josh eats 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

24 slices ÷ 6 slices/day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, we need to calculate the total number of months in 5 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, there are 5 * 12 = 60 months.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the 9 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount:

\[ 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

2,000 gallons"
"Let's break down the expenses and earnings step by step.

1. **Initial Spending:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so he has spent \(5 \times 10 = \$50\) on movie tickets.
   - He has also seen 8 movies on other days, so he has spent \(8 \times 7 = \$56\) on movie tickets.
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he has spent \(2 \times 8 = \$16\) on popcorn.
   - He had 4 boxes of candy, so he has spent \(4 \times 2 = \$8\) on candy.

2. **Total Spent:**
   - Total spent so far: \(50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = \$130\).

3. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is \(150 - 130 = \$20\).

4. **Current Day:**
   - It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, so he wants to see a movie and get a popcorn and a box of candy that night.
   - Cost of a movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday: \$10.
   - Cost of popcorn: \$8.
   - Cost of a box of candy: \$2.
   - Total cost for the night: \(10 + 8 + 2 = \$20\).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since the total cost for the night is exactly \$20, which is his remaining budget, he can see 1 movie that night.

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

1. Maria invited 4 friends, so there are 4 + 1 (Maria) = 5 people in total.
2. Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
3. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
4. Then her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Initial balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by mom: 15

Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 15 = 24

The total number of balloons the girls had is 24."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and the boxes they already have:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes / Boxes per table = \(60 / 2 = 30\) tables

They already own 15 tables, so we need to find out how many new tables they need:

- New tables needed = Total tables required - Tables they already have
- New tables needed = \(30 - 15 = 15\)

Therefore, they need 15 new tables.

- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per month: 43,200
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per month: 32,400
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds
3 pounds less than that: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total hay needed for the goats and sheep:

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\)
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\)

Adding these together gives the total hay needed:

\(75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}\)

Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from his remaining money:

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add Craig's total to his brother's total:

300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, let's calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs:

He initially spent $90 and then received $200 from selling 5 CDs, so the net amount he was out is:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

   - Total earnings from yams = 6 * $1.5 = $9.

2. Earnings from sweet potatoes:
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2 = $20.

3. Earnings from carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."

   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the first 12 miles:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Resting time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **New swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Time to swim the remaining 8 miles:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Total time:**
   Add up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"To calculate Gustavo's total commission, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times sales.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Gustavo gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- Gustavo gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Finally, we add the two commissions to get the total commission:

\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

So, Gustavo will earn a total commission of $15."
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the three players is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From equation 2, we have \( A = B - 20 \).
- From equation 3, we have \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, we substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
- \( A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \)
- \( D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \)

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:

The book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Actual Sleep Duration:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is the actual time Kim was asleep.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 480 minutes.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
   - Total actual sleep duration: \(480 + 55 = 535\) minutes.

5. **Subtract Sleepwalking Time:**
   - Total sleep duration minus sleepwalking time: \(535 - 23 = 512\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 512 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
34"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:

\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( J \).
2. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, we can find the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

Total holes at the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\)

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( X \):

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the third equation into the above equation to eliminate \( A \):

\[ 2S + (4A - 13) = 334 \]
\[ 2S + 4A - 13 = 334 \]
\[ 2S + 4A = 347 \]

Now, we can substitute \( A \) from the third equation into this new equation:

\[ 2S + 4(4A - 13) = 347 \]
\[ 2S + 16A - 52 = 347 \]
\[ 2S + 16A = 399 \]

We can now solve for \( S \) and \( A \) by expressing \( S \) in terms of \( A \) from the third equation:

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Substitute this into the equation \( 2S + 16A = 399 \):

\[ 2(4A - 13) + 16A = 399 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + 16A = 399 \]
\[ 24A - 26 = 399 \]
\[ 24A = 425 \]
\[ A = \frac{425}{24} \]
\[ A = 17.70833333 \]

Since the number of Pokemon must be an integer, we need to recheck the problem statement and calculations. However, the problem seems to have a setup that leads to a non-integer solution, which is unusual for such problems. Assuming the problem is correctly stated and we are to find the closest integer solution, we can round \( A \) to the nearest integer, which is 18.

Now, we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(18) - 13 \]
\[ S = 72 - 13 \]
\[ S = 59 \]

So, Stan has caught 59 Pokemon.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the end of the day:

- Initial brownies: 12
- Brownies from office party: +6
- Brownies from surprise party: +48
- Total before eating: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66
- Brownies eaten during the surprise party: -18

So, the number of brownies left over is:

66 - 18 = 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the last 2 phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the last 2 phones together, the total cost is:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she kept:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, if we add up the cherries that Robert, Richard, and Jerry have, it should equal 60.
4. We know Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, so together they have \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
5. Therefore, Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:
$100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 - 6 = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So we calculate:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

5 * 5 = 25

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed and then calculate the cost of the additional plants she needs to buy.

First, let's convert the width of each plant and the space between plants to feet:
- Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 12/12 = 1 foot wide.
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

So, each plant and the space between it and the next plant take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

Now, let's calculate how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed:
- The number of plants that can fit is 111 / 2.5 = 44.4.

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:
- 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
- 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week (7 days), his brother eats:

Final numerical answer:
63"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply it by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is equal to the remaining soil:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3 roses"
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs, which means she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month with her current savings.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by the number of months in a year:

\[ 0 \times 12 = 0 \]

So, Jessica can buy 0 pairs of shoes in a year."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees per hour:
   - Temperature change = 3 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 6 degrees

2. The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees per hour:
   - Temperature change = 4 hours * 3 degrees/hour = 12 degrees

3. After that, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up 2 degrees per hour:
   - Temperature change = 2 hours * 2 degrees/hour = 4 degrees

Now, let's sum up the total temperature change:
- Total temperature change = -6 degrees (cooling on low) + 12 degrees (cooling on high) - 4 degrees (warming up)
- Total temperature change = -6 + 12 - 4 = 2 degrees

The final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

2 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and the Comet orbits every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the Comet would be 75 years later. So, Bill's dad would be:

\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting for Bill is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. Electric bill: Once per month, so \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.
2. Gas bill: Once per month, so \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks per year.
3. Church: Twice per month, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks per year.
4. Pest and lawn service: Quarterly, which means 4 times a year, so \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks per year.

Now, we add up all the checks:
\[12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\]

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.
2. The second plane's 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

Now, let's analyze the first plane's flights:

- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

So, the first plane makes:
- \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights to Greece.
- The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
- \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

\(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam's trousers cost $30.
- His mother gave him $6.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \), so the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets is:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
1.5 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 6.5 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the 9 hours available:
9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

So, Doctor Jones will have 2.5 hours left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The studio rental cost per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To find the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female porcupines.
2. Determine the number of baby porcupines born each month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
4. Add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. The total population is 50, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. To find the number of baby porcupines born in a year, we multiply the number of baby porcupines born each month by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of baby porcupines to the initial population to get the final population:
   \[
   \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the final number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, they have a total of 34 sticks.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so:
   \[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are over 16 years old} \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so:
   \[ \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \text{ male students are over 16 years old} \]
4. The remaining students over 16 years old are female, so:
   \[ 1500 - 375 = 1125 \text{ female students are over 16 years old} \]

5. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so:
   \[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are under 16 years old} \]
6. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so:
   \[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ male students are under 16 years old} \]
7. The remaining students under 16 are female, so:
   \[ 1500 - 750 = 750 \text{ female students are under 16 years old} \]

8. To find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and under 16:
   \[ 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
10 + 4 = 14 laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
14 / 2 = 7 laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
7 - 2 = 5 laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.

   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons"
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of that amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has bought:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Now, we need to find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy is:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = Total packs × Sweets per pack
Total sweets = 15 × 60
Total sweets = 900

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2
Packs given to friends = 13

Now, we need to find out how many sweets were in those 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = Packs given to friends × Sweets per pack
Sweets given to friends = 13 × 60
Sweets given to friends = 780

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally among her 10 friends:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends ÷ Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 ÷ 10
Sweets per friend = 78

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and distributed them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

We know that 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. So, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

3 albums * 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits

Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 

Final numerical answer:
27 selfies
18 portraits"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests.
5. After the afternoon check-ins, the number of guests increases by 30:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."
"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
Then he picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is 12."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the daily total and then multiply by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:
5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day.

Now, to find the weekly total, we multiply the daily total by 7:
11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches per week.

The family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80 from the cookies.

She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240 from the cupcakes.

In total, she earned $80 + $240 = $320.

She gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away 2 * $10 = $20.

Therefore, the amount of money she has left is $320 - $20 = $300.

**Final Answer: $300**"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found:

30 (first twin) + 30 (second twin) = 60 eggs

This means that the number of eggs left for their friends to find is:

100 (total eggs) - 60 (eggs found by Smith twins) = 40 eggs

However, it's mentioned that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found:

40 (remaining eggs) - 10 (unfound eggs) = 30 eggs

So, the friends found 30 eggs.

30 eggs"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ore mined per day with each tool:**
   - With bare hands: 12 pounds per day.
   - With an iron pickaxe: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe: \(24 \times 1.5 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds per day.
   - In a month with 30 days, one dwarf mines \(36 \times 30 = 1080\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - 40 dwarves each mine 1080 pounds in a month.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich and then use that to calculate the cost for 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich for the first package is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Therefore, the price per sandwich for the second package is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package should also be $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
- The cost for 8 sandwiches at $1.5 per sandwich is \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, we need to determine the remaining amount Tom needs to pay after selling his old bedroom set. He buys a new one for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000, so the remaining amount is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Next, we need to calculate the monthly payment with a 10% interest rate. Since he has to pay 10% interest per month, the monthly payment is 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally initially has:
   - 25 red balloons
   - 7 green balloons
   - 12 yellow balloons

2. 40% of the red balloons burst:
   - 40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons

3. Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons:
   - Half of 12 = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons

4. Sally finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her remaining balloons:
   - 75% of 8 = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added
   - Total balloons after adding blue ones = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons

So, the final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.3 - 0.5 \times 0.24 - 0.3 \times 0.24 + 0.5 \times 0.3 \times 0.24) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.15 - 0.12 - 0.072 + 0.036) = 1 - 0.756 = 0.244 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.244 \times 100 = 24.4\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

24.4%"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty.
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats
2. Available seats for tickets: 6000 (total capacity) - 1250 (allocated seats) = 4750 seats
3. Tickets per graduate: 4750 (available seats) / 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets

Each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. So, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is \(2 \times 75 = 150\).
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans, we multiply 150 by 3.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
\]

The ""+1"" is because we need to count the bottle at the starting point.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[
8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds per interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take for him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have earned $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 over 4 years.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would earn with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to find out how long it would take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals $300,000.

4. **Calculate the time needed to earn the equivalent amount:**
   - The total amount to be earned is $300,000.
   - His new annual income is $75,000.
   - Time needed = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first find one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we find twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209

"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net loss: $21.5 - $11 = $10.5

To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races (3):

Average loss: \(\frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5\)

So, Johnny's dad lost on average $3.5 per race that day."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total number of people living in these cities.

Step 1: Number of cities in South America
There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. So, the total number of cities is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Step 2: Total number of people
Each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the time worked per day to hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team in 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - They worked for 3 weeks, so the total number of days is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, the hours worked by each painter is \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + x + 8 = 38 \]
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is 10.

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

The formula for depreciation is:
\[ \text{Final Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3.

Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Final Value} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Total distance from San Diego to New York City: 1955 kilometers
Distance driven in 4 days: 325 kilometers

Distance remaining to be driven = Total distance - Distance already driven
Distance remaining to be driven = 1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers
Distance remaining to be driven = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

"To find out how much James pays for insurance a year after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Calculate the total annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

First, let's find the increased monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the insurance cost increased by 60% due to the accident. To find 60% of $120, we use the following calculation:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost is $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to get the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

James now pays $192 per month for his insurance. To find the total annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down the charges:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, which is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James receives in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

80% of 80 emails is calculated as follows:
\[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. 

To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
   - The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. Now, we calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both groups.
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he can take advantage of the promotion by buying 3 pounds at the full price and getting 3 pounds at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For the first 3 pounds, the cost is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

For the next 3 pounds (at half price), the cost is:
3 pounds * ($4.00/pound * 0.5) = 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00

Adding these together, the total cost is:

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

The party will cost $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. So, the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write the equation for the total bananas as:

\[7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[24 + x = 45\]

Subtracting 24 from both sides:

\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes after it arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, which is 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 120 minutes after the first train arrives. This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes and leaves at 30 minutes. The second train arrives at 40 minutes and leaves at 45 minutes. The third train arrives at 100 minutes and leaves at 100 minutes. The fourth train arrives at 120 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait 120 minutes for his train.

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Original Price of the Watch**: $2000

2. **Price Mr. Rogers Paid**: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers Paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

3. **Price Mr. Rogers Sold the Watch**: Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers Sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

4. **Percentage Discount for Mr. Rogers' Friend**: The friend bought the watch at $1800, which is 90% of the original price (since 1800 is 90% of 2000).
   \[
   \text{Percentage Discount} = \left(1 - \frac{1800}{2000}\right) \times 100 = (1 - 0.9) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is **10%**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas in 10 bunches:**
   - Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
   - Therefore, 10 bunches contain \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

2. **Calculate the cost of 40 bananas if bought individually:**
   - Each banana costs $0.80.
   - Therefore, the cost of 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of 10 bunches:**
   - Each bunch costs $3.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - The cost of buying 40 bananas individually is $32.
   - The cost of buying 10 bunches is $30.
   - Therefore, the savings is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + H = 100 \)
2. \( H = S + 60 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking: $450

   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

**Final Answer:**
Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Normal periods**: 6 periods
2. **Extra classes**: 2 extra classes
3. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
4. **Days in a week**: 5 days (Monday to Friday)
5. **Extra learning time**: 1/16 of the weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday

First, calculate the total time spent in classes during the week:

- Total periods in a week: \(6 + 2 = 8\)
- Duration of each period: 40 minutes
- Total time in classes per week: \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes

Next, calculate the total time spent in classes on Saturday and Sunday:

- Total time in classes on Saturday and Sunday: \(2 \times 40 = 80\) minutes

Now, calculate the total weekly time spent in classes:

- Total weekly time in classes: \(320 + 80 = 400\) minutes

Then, calculate the extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:

- Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: \(\frac{1}{16} \times 400 = 25\) minutes

Now, calculate the total weekly learning time:

- Total weekly learning time: \(400 + 25 = 425\) minutes

Finally, convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

The height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \(0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000\).

2. Calculate the total amount of money needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed is \(40,000 \times 20 = 800,000\).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \(0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000\).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - To save $800,000, she needs \(\frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40\) years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm

Each of these parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm

Each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, which has 30 days, Soledad needs to cover:

\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day} \]

Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, which totals:

\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the distance she plans to cover from the distance she needs to cover:

\[ 310 \text{ miles per day} - 250 \text{ miles per day} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
$21 + $11 = $32

Then, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
$32 - $5 = $27

Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
$27 - $19 = $8

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer: $8**"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate 20% of 50:

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

Now, we add this increase to the original number of students:

50 + 10 = 60

So, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 255 blinks in 5 minutes

We want to find the time \( T \) for 459 blinks.

The proportion can be set up as:
\[ \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{T \text{ minutes}} \]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( T \):
\[ 255T = 459 \times 5 \]

\[ 255T = 2295 \]

Dividing both sides by 255:
\[ T = \frac{2295}{255} \]

\[ T = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

The final numerical answer is:
9 minutes"

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's dog-walking chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours, so let's say Dior took at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours, but since it's ""well over,"" we can assume it took at least 9 hours (since 8 would not be ""well over"").

Adding up the time for all three chores:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 70 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. 

The final numerical answer is:
35 miles"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 12 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour} \]
Over 10 hours, they produce:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the toys produced by the first four workers:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys, which means the first four workers have produced:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour} \]

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Let's say Seth had \( x \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{x}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the rest to Kris, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{4} = 16 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
x = 16 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 64

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that speed to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Since Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, Sarah painted \( 30 - C \) eggs.
5. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = (30 - C) + 12 \).

Now, let's solve for \( C \):

\[ C = 30 - C + 12 \]
\[ 2C = 42 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs. Now, we can find out how many eggs Sarah painted:

\[ 30 - C = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56, and we can write the equation for the total:

\[ A + A + C + (30 - C) = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \, \text{crayons} \times 1 \, \text{ounce/crayon} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \, \text{boxes} \times 8 \, \text{ounces/box} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \, \text{ounces} + 200 \, \text{ounces} = 400 \, \text{ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \, \text{ounces}}{16 \, \text{ounces/pound}} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach.

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write:

\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk at this speed. The time \( t \) it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is:

\[ t = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for him to drink it.

The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water:

\[
\text{Temperature of the mixture} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, let's solve this inequality for \( T \):

\[
4 \times 33 + T \geq 40 \times 5
\]

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 200 - 132

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks:
\[ \text{Total cows} = 50 \text{ (initial)} + 420 \text{ (added)} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Total chickens} = 20 \text{ (initial)} + 210 \text{ (added)} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write this as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiplying gives \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - So, \(54 = 2x\).

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over that period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:

"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. So, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

Dividing both sides by 14, we find:

\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:

- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
4. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both the individual sunflowers and the bouquets over 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Sunflowers sold from bouquets per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Total sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from individual sales + Sunflowers from bouquets.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Total sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the total revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. The loss is the difference between his initial investment and his revenue:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, Adam loses $16.

"To find out how many days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

For large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes = 45 / 5 = 9 days.

For medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes = 36 / 6 = 6 days.

For small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes = 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, we sum up the days required for each size:
- Total days = 9 days (large) + 6 days (medium) + 7 days (small) = 22 days.

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of winning with the second ticket and then find the probability that both tickets are winners.

1. The probability of winning with the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 20%, which is 0.60 or 60%.

3. The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning with each ticket, assuming the events are independent.

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets being winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price, which means he sells each device for $20 * 2 = $40.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the total cost for Monday's devices is 2 * $20 = $40.

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the total cost for Tuesday's devices is 4 * $20 = $80.

The total cost for all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is $40 + $80 = $120.

He sold all 6 devices for $40 each, so the total revenue from selling all the devices is 6 * $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $120 = $120.

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday."
"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to determine the total number of bottles required and then find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce.

First, let's calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:

1. Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to reach this total. Hortex can currently produce 4200 bottles per day.

The additional number of bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second piece of information:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we can substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**

   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he uses to pay the bill is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Chalk used = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

3. **Daily Usage**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - Daily usage = 20% of the remaining chalk.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.

5. **Calculating Days Until Recycling**:
   - Day 1: 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.
     - Remaining chalk = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.2 inches.
   - Day 2: 20% of 2.2 inches = 0.20 * 2.2 = 0.44 inches.
     - Remaining chalk = 2.2 inches - 0.44 inches = 1.76 inches.

Since 1.76 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on the second day.

**Final Answer**:
The teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to find out how many books he can buy per school. Since the $27000 is distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the sequence of events to find out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
   - Apples picked up: 2
   - Apples in pocket: 1
   - Apples on the ground: 0

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples in pocket: 2
   - Apples on the ground: 5

3. Newton picked up these 5 apples and put all but one in his pocket, throwing the remaining one at the tree, which caused 6 more apples to fall out.
   - Apples in pocket: 6
   - Apples on the ground: 6

4. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.
   - Apples in pocket: 6 + 6 = 12

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is 12."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
6 friends * 6 slices per friend = 36 slices

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
6 friends * 4 slices per friend = 24 slices

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
36 slices / 12 slices per pie = 3 pies

For the pepperoni pizza:
24 slices / 8 slices per pie = 3 pies

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
3 cheese pizza pies + 3 pepperoni pizza pies = 6 pizza pies

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs built per hour**: Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs melting per 15 minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the net loss of snowballs per hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) snowballs.

3. **Net gain of snowballs per hour**: Therefore, the net gain of snowballs per hour is \(20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

4. **Target number of snowballs**: Jay wants to have 60 snowballs.

5. **Time to reach 60 snowballs**: To find out how many hours it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we divide the target number of snowballs by the net gain per hour: \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out, and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we subtract 20 years from John's current age, we can find out how old he was when Digimon came out:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8
   \]
   So, John was 8 years old when Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim must have been half of that age:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out.

4. To find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24
   \]

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages.
   Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 - 28 = -16\] bandages, but since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. So, at the end of the second day, they had 0 bandages and needed to order 16 more to meet the demand.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages.
   They also used half a pack, which is:
   \[0.5 \times 50 = 25\] bandages.
   Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[100 - 25 = 75\] bandages, plus the 0 bandages they had at the end of the second day, which means they had:
   \[75 + 0 = 75\] bandages before receiving the 100 bandages on the third day.

Since they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, the number of bandages they started with on the first day must be:
\[78 - 75 = 3\]

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**

"To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the problem into steps and add the numbers accordingly.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

Now, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac is 50% more per bottle than the cost of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person gets 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses 4 colors. Now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, she loses 3 more colors.

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she has left is \(22 - 3 = 19\).

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he owes:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = \text{Total Amount} - \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. The estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's guess and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]

3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop enter the bus. So, the number of people entering at the second stop is:
   \[\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]

4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]

5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[20\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%).
   - 250% of $2 is \(2 \times 2.5 = $5\).

3. **Number of Visits Per Year:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.

4. **Total Visits in the First 5 Years:**
   - In 5 years, she visits \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(15 \times 2 = $30\).

5. **Total Visits in the Next 3 Years:**
   - In the next 3 years, she visits \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.
   - The cost for these visits is \(9 \times 5 = $45\).

6. **Total Cost Over 8 Years:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years.
   - Total cost = $30 + $45 = $75.

Therefore, Pauline spent a total of $75 on all visits to the museum."
"There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who can try the escape room. So, there are a total of 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students who can try the escape room.

If 8 students can try the escape room at a time, then the number of groups needed is 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

Since each group uses their full 45 minutes, the total time for all groups to try the escape room is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discounted price for a manicure = $35 - (20% of $35) = $35 - ($35 * 0.20) = $35 - $7 = $28
Discounted price for a pedicure = $40 - (20% of $40) = $40 - ($40 * 0.20) = $40 - $8 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails.
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).

Cost of nail art = 20 nails * $3 per nail = $60

Step 3: Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.
Total cost = Discounted price for a manicure + Discounted price for a pedicure + Cost of nail art
Total cost = $28 + $32 + $60 = $120

Therefore, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues per year, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues. We already have the number of magazines from the information given: 3 magazines of 12 issues each, 1 magazine of 6 issues, and 1 magazine of 24 issues.

So, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

From point 3, we can determine how many paintings Kim has:
\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings.

Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's break down the price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 standard 1-hour lessons:

Standard rate = $80 per hour
Number of standard lessons = 4
Total from standard lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

Next, let's calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

Reduced rate = 75% of $80 = 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour
Number of veteran lessons = 2
Total from veteran lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

Now, let's add the totals from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

Total for the day = Total from standard lessons + Total from veteran lessons
Total for the day = $320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
     \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so there are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times \$2.40 = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times \$1 = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"

2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the requirement.

First, let's find out the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to answer:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test. We subtract the number of questions she has already answered correctly from the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final numerical answer is:

- There are 8 rooms in the house, and there are 2 flashlights for each room, so there are \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
- In total, there are \(4 + 16 = 20\) flashlights.

For the candles:
- Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms with small candles. This means there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
- The other half of the 8 rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are also \(4\) rooms with medium candles. This means there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

In total, there are \(16 + 20 = 36\) candles.

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using 20 flashlights and 36 candles.

Final numerical answer:
20 flashlights and 36 candles."
"Mitchell buys two bags of chips, with each bag containing 55 chips. 

So, the total number of chips is:
2 bags * 55 chips/bag = 110 chips

If Mitchell's family has five members and they all get the same number of chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

110 chips / 5 family members = 22 chips per person

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

1. The number of robots is half the number of helmets:
   \[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

2. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs:
   \[ \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."

"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
2. Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
3. Subtract the total drying time with the old varnish from the total drying time with the new varnish.

Step 1: Total drying time with the old varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the old varnish: 7 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Step 2: Total drying time with the new varnish
- Drying time for one painting with the new varnish: 12 minutes
- Number of paintings: 6
- Total drying time = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Step 3: Difference in total drying time
- Difference = Total drying time with new varnish - Total drying time with old varnish
- Difference = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish."
"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we can break down the problem into parts based on the different watering needs of the plants.

1. For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water each:
   \(4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\) cups

2. For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
   \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we need to find out how many plants are left:
   Total plants = 20
   Plants needing half a cup = 4
   Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   Plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 4 - 8 = 8
   So, for the 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each:
   \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups

Now, we add up all the cups of water needed:
\(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas Frog will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes for him to hop 100 yards on land is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. Therefore, the time it takes for him to swim 100 yards in water is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on land and in water, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob thinks he needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ popsicle sticks}}{8 \text{ popsicle sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the main phone is \( 2x \). We know that \( 2x = 20 \), so \( x = 10 \).

Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is \( 20 + 40 = 60 \).

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the number of days in June.
3. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes \(\$7200\) in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade takes 7 photos in one batch and uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

To find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

For one week:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, for 5 weeks:
Total for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be found by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. The total number of people he saw on these four days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining four days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
500."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** 3 times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** 4 times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped during the cooking process:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{210}

"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he would need 2 times the lemon juice, which is 2 * 1 cup = 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 * 6 lemons = 36 lemons.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Altogether, the number of seeds in both sunflowers is:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

Final numerical answer:

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is:

\[ 36"" \times 2 = 72"" \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72"" - 2"" = 70"" \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, so before the summer, her height was:

\[ 70"" - 3"" = 67"" \]

Therefore, Jackie was 67"" tall before the summer."

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.
2. Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:

Total revenue = 10 * $50 = $500

Finally, calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - James is putting together 4 tables.

   - So, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. Next, calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - So, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. Finally, calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
