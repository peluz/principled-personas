"First, let's determine the total number of eggs Janet has each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we account for the eggs Janet uses:
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
- She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins for her friends.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet uses some for her own consumption and baking:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the remaining eggs is:
\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars per egg} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the amount of each type of fiber required.

1. The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

Next, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together to find the total number of bolts needed:
\[
2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
\]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the house and repairs:**
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Cost of repairs: $50,000
   - Total cost: \( 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \)

2. **Determine the new value of the house after repairs:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - A 150% increase means the value is multiplied by 2.5 (since 100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original value).
   - Original value of the house: $80,000
   - New value: \( 80,000 \times 2.5 = 200,000 \)

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the total cost.
   - New value of the house: $200,000
   - Total cost: $130,000
   - Profit: \( 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \)

Therefore, Josh's profit is \(\boxed{70000}\)."
"To determine the total number of meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, we know that in one session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day. Since each chicken is given 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken consumes:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Given that Wendi has 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement for the entire flock is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

- Morning: 15 cups
- Afternoon: 25 cups

The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

First, let's calculate the cost for the second glass:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]

Now, we can see that the pattern is: $5, $3, $5, $3, and so on. This means that for every pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can determine the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

So, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   \[
   \text{Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Calculate the time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Add the time for the Windows update restart:**
   - The restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.6 \times 200 = 120 \text{ GB}\).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Sum up all the times:**

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled and then subtract the distance he has covered from the initial distance to his home.

1. **Initial Trip to the Turnaround Point:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 4 hours in total to get back home.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he covers 0 miles during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - The remaining time is 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours, and he drives at 80 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance = 0 miles (standstill) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance to home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on the return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{45}\) miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for both her regular hours and her overtime hours separately, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the pay for regular hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She worked 40 regular hours.
   - Regular pay = \( 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \).

2. **Calculate the pay for overtime hours:**
   - Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime pay rate = \( 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \).
   - Overtime pay = \( 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \).

3. **Calculate total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay.
   - Total earnings = \( \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \).

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads was three times the first month.
   - Therefore, the number of downloads in the second month is \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \).

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month.
   - First, calculate 30% of 180: \( 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \).
   - Subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month: \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from each month: \( 60 + 180 + 126 \).

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is \(\boxed{366}\)."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times 68 = 204 \) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times 55 = 330 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90. We set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Net profit per year} \times \text{Number of years} = \text{Initial cost}
   \]
   \[
   \$7.5 \times \text{Number of years} = \$90
   \]
   Solving for the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{12}\) years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the green house is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x}{6} - 1 = \frac{x}{3} - 1
   \]
   According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{x}{3} = 6 \implies x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find out how many students are left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. We calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance as follows:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we determine the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to break down her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- Jill earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- Jill earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

So, Jill's annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of eggs Claire uses in one week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs she uses, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. 

The final numerical answer is:

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture is \(\boxed{15}\) liters."
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
3. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, we know that Samantha is currently 31 years old and Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond's current age is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age of Raymond's son when he was born is 23 years before Raymond's current age:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years old} \]
This means Raymond's son is currently 2 years old.

Since Samantha is currently 31 years old, the number of years ago Raymond's son was born is:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 29 years ago. The final answer is:

\[ 5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, in 4 hours, the candle will melt:
\[ 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

So, the candle will be \(\boxed{8}\) centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he received a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of item and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
\[
\text{Total cost for shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
\text{Total cost for pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
\text{Total cost for shoes} = 3 \times 42 = 126
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 126 = 243
\]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is:
\[
\boxed{243}
\]"
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance traveled before the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance remaining after the first stop: \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.
4. Identify the distance of the second stop, which is 15 miles before the end of the trip: \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles from the start.
5. Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops: \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

Thus, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the other pair of high heels is twice that amount, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell's and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the total of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"First, let's determine the guesses of each friend:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\), so 25% more than 80 is \(80 + 20 = 100\).

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

The sum of the guesses is:
\[80 + 60 + 100 = 240\]

The average is:
\[\frac{240}{3} = 80\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of his dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

1. Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:
   Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.

2. Calculate the total daily time spent on all dogs:
   John has 10 dogs, so the total daily time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of his dogs each week is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Raymond's jewels} + 5 \]

Substituting the number of Raymond's jewels:

\[ \text{Aaron's jewels} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Next, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. We know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = \text{Aaron's jewels} - 2 \]

Substituting the number of Aaron's jewels:

\[ \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"First, we determine how many points Mike scores in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than in the first 20 minutes. Since he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:

\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, we find the total points scored by adding the points from both halves of the game:

\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Thus, the total points Mike scored is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, over 30 days he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. This can be calculated by dividing 60 by 4:

\[ 60 \text{ yogurts} \div 4 \text{ yogurts/set} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money John spends on the video games. He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so the total cost of the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left should equal the total amount of money he had from selling the lego sets. We can verify this by subtracting the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total amount of money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the calculation checks out, we now need to determine how many lego sets John still has. The problem states that he sold all his lego sets initially, so he no longer has any lego sets left. Therefore, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   John runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. Therefore, he runs:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   on each of the other two days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   \[
   3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Average speed:**
   Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed = 3 miles per hour.
- Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.

Thus, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time spent running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period.

Time spent running:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Time spent walking:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled during each activity.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

   - Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone:**
   - Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   \[
   \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, we need to determine the throwing distance of the gold javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone. According to the problem, when Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance.

Polly's normal throwing distance without the gemstone is 400 feet. Therefore, with the gemstone, her throwing distance is:
\[ 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from Polly's throwing distance:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the initial number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's determine the calorie content of the entire 300g bag of chips. Since the bag has 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day after consuming 1800 calories. If the daily calorie target is 2000 calories, then the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining 200 calories. Since the entire 300g bag contains 1250 calories, the number of grams per calorie is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} \]

Therefore, the number of grams that can be eaten with 200 calories is:

\[ 200 \text{ calories} \times 0.24 \text{ grams/calorie} = 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the total cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \) articles.
  \[
  \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  \]
  So, on Tuesday, she wrote \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 \) articles.
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[
5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[
26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]"
"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used at Work**: She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using the notes at work, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had before using any at work is the sum of the initial notes and the notes from the package:
\[ 80 + x \]

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know that after using the notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."

"To determine how long it takes Tom to travel back, we need to know the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided directly in the question. We can calculate it using the speed and time for the outbound trip.

1. Calculate the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM:
   - Speed = 10 miles per hour
   - Time = 4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

2. Now, calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 miles per hour:
   - Distance = 30 miles
   - Speed = 6 miles per hour
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."

- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  4 \times 40 = 160
  \]
- Total revenue on Thursday:
  \[
  360 + 160 = 520
  \]

Next, let's calculate the revenue earned on Friday:

- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires at $40 each:
  \[
  12 \times 40 = 480
  \]
- Total revenue on Friday:
  \[

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of players and coaches for both the girls' and boys' teams from each school.

1. Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys'), and each team has 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}\).

2. Each school also sends 2 coaches (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team).
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \text{ coaches}\).

3. Since there are 4 schools, we need to multiply the number of players and coaches per school by 4.
   - Total players: \(10 \text{ players/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 40 \text{ players}\).
   - Total coaches: \(2 \text{ coaches/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 8 \text{ coaches}\).

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 22 - 8 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

   - Total number of blocks = Number of years vacationing × Number of vacations per year
   - Total number of blocks = 11 × 4 = 44.

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of rings for each of the three alarms and then sum them up.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first alarm.
   - Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the second alarm also rang 4 times (assuming the number of rings is the same as the duration in terms of cycles).

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third alarm rang for half as long as the second alarm.
   - Since the second alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm rang \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of rings from all three alarms:
\[
4 \text{ (first alarm)} + 4 \text{ (second alarm)} + 2 \text{ (third alarm)} = 10
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **Annual Salary for the First 5 Years**: Since the salary does not change for the first 5 years, her annual salary remains:
   \[
   600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Salary Increase After 5 Years**: After 5 years, her salary increases by 10%. The new monthly salary after the increase is:
   \[
   600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, her new annual salary is:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Salary Increase for Each Subsequent Year**: The salary increases by 10% each year for the next three years. We need to calculate the salary for each of these years.

   - **Year 6 (First Year After 5 Years)**:
     \[
     660 \times 1.10 = 726 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]
     Annual salary:
     \[
     726 \times 12 = 8712 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Year 7**:
     \[
     726 \times 1.10 = 798.60 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]
     Annual salary:
     \[
     798.60 \times 12 = 9583.20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Year 8**:
     \[
     798.60 \times 1.10 = 878.46 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]
     Annual salary:
     \[
     878.46 \times 12 = 10541.52 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[
\boxed{10541.52}

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"First, let's determine how many guests are expected to actually attend the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the invited guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to attend is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags required. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

First, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the adults will eat:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds.
- There are 5 children.

\[
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of potato salad needed for the adults and the children to find the total amount of potato salad required:

\[
200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Calculate the number of pets Marcia has:**
   Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pets Jan has:**
   Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   \[
   \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Add the number of pets each person has.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the children step by step.

1. Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
   - Amy's age = \( A \)
   - Jackson's age = \( J \)
   - Corey's age = \( C \)
   - James's age = 10

2. According to the problem, James is 1 year younger than Corey:
   \[
   C = 10 + 1 = 11
   \]

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
   \[
   A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
   \]

4. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson:
   \[
   A = J + 5
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( A \) we found:
   \[
   9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Jackson is \(\boxed{4}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. Since Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to find out Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster than his original time. Therefore, his new time is:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, which includes rabbits, dogs, and cats. Let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. **Number of Dogs:**
   \[
   \text{Number of dogs} = 60
   \]

2. **Number of Cats:**
   According to the problem, there are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Combined Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   \[
   \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

4. **Number of Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = \text{Combined number of dogs and cats} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

5. **Total Number of Pets:**
   The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is:
\[
\boxed{348}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. Therefore, the number of boys is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
\]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[
200 - 80 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem states that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
\]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
120 - 80 = 40
\]

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"First, we need to determine how many hours James slept. Since James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
   \[
   32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans are needed to get 64 ounces of tomatoes, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
   \[
   \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes in 4 cans is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.
- Originally, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated by adding the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes, and then subtracting the 5 cars that took an exit. This total should equal the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has before giving any away. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she currently has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she currently has:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we add the 18 new potted plants she received to the remaining plants:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum these values.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we sum the number of doorbell rings from all four friends:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his water consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also has a glass of water before bed.
   - Therefore, each weekday, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 5 weekdays, he drinks \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - On weekends, John still has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - However, he has a soda with dinner instead of water.
   - Therefore, each weekend day, John drinks \(3 + 1 = 4\) glasses of water.
   - Over 2 weekend days, he drinks \(4 \times 2 = 8\) glasses of water.

3. **Total for the week:**
   - Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends, we get \(20 + 8 = 28\) glasses of water.

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles of the city. We do this by multiplying the time per mile by the total number of miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

To perform the multiplication:
\[
42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it will take the fog bank \(\boxed{140}\) minutes to cover the whole city."
"First, let's determine how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box and then calculate its inner volume. Finally, we will multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - Each box has outer dimensions of 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the inner dimensions:
     \[
     V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the inner volume of one box by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total inner volume} = 24 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
     \]

Thus, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
  - Total for Monday and Tuesday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

- **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
  - Total for Thursday: \(1 \text{ hour} + 0.5 \text{ hour} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)

- **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
  - Total for Friday: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

- **Total hours for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 
  - \(2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}\)

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in the week. Therefore, the hours he watched on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
- Total hours for Wednesday: \(7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\)

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can determine the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours for Wednesday by the length of each episode:
- Number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday: \(\frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{0.5 \text{ hours/episode}} = 3 \text{ episodes}\)

Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them had.

For Beatrice:
- The roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice had is:
  \[
  2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

For Marcell:
- The roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell had is:
  \[
  3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

Next, we find the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice combined:
\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2):
\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten is:

     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on during the journey:**
   - Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.
   - The total water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Total water intake} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
2. Each lesson involves the use of the whiteboard.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, calculate the number of lessons per day for all teachers combined:
- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Therefore, the total number of lessons per day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:

   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).

2. **Solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]

3. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - The maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 300 = 50D \).

4. **Solve for \( D \):**
   \[
   D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]

Thus, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Sasha has 10 such boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Sasha has 5 such boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80 \).

3. **Total original cost:**
   - Total cost for all boards: \( \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \).

Next, let's calculate the new prices after the 50% increase.

4. **New price of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $10.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $10 = \( 0.50 \times \$10 = \$5 \).
   - New price: \( \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \).

5. **New price of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Original price: $16.
   - Increase: \( 50\% \) of $16 = \( 0.50 \times \$16 = \$8 \).
   - New price: \( \$16 + \$8 = \$24 \).

Now, let's calculate the total selling price.

6. **Total selling price of 2x4x10 boards:**

Finally, let's calculate the profit.

9. **Profit:**
   - Total selling price: $270.
   - Total original cost: $180.
   - Profit: \( \$270 - \$180 = \$90 \).

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water and the total amount of sugar and water used.

The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, the total parts of the mixture (sugar + water) is \(7 + 13 = 20\) parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts of the mixture is 20, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total teaspoons by the total parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the amount of sugar is 7 parts, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar by multiplying the value of one part by 7:
\[
\text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \times 6 = 42
\]

Thus, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is \(\boxed{42}\)."

   6 \text{ pairs} \times 60 \text{ dollars/pair} = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John paid \(\boxed{360}\) dollars."
"First, we calculate the number of vehicles already at the port from the initial 2 containers:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles added on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's salary four years ago.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \).

2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's new salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.
   - Assuming her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her new salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:**
   - Adrien's new salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's new salary is $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

"To determine the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to break down her sleep schedule day by day.

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours per day}
   \]
   For both Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   She slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
   \]

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to find out how many semi-automatic cars are available. We know the total number of cars and the number of automatic and manual cars.

1. Total number of cars = 20
2. Number of automatic cars = 12
3. Number of manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \). Additionally, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of the number of queens, baby bees, and worker bees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
To find \( Q \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]
So, the number of queens is 100. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \). The number of worker bees is \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

"First, let's identify which items are non-food items. In this case, the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The milk and eggs are food items.

The cost of the non-food items is:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total cost of food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Each harvest yields 1000 pineapples.
   - There are 4 harvests in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is \(1000 \times 4 = 4000\) pineapples.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4000}
\]"
"To determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each set and then sum them up.

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set:
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Now, we sum the pieces from all three sets:
\[
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
\]

Thus, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: 30 bees

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - Bees leaving: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Bees returning: All the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the next 6 hours, minus those that returned in the previous 6 hours.
   - Bees that left in the first 12 hours: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees
   - Bees that returned in the first 12 hours: \( 15 \) bees
   - Bees returning in the last 6 hours: \( 90 - 15 = 75 \) bees

"To determine how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets.
2. Add the change received to the total cost to find the amount given.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets:
- The cost of an adult ticket is $12.
- The cost of a child ticket is $10.
- Therefore, the total cost for 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket is:
  \[
  12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we know that Brittany's mom received $8 in change. To find out how much money she gave the cashier, we add the change to the total cost of the tickets:
\[
22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[

"First, let's determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the number of Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. We know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we can calculate James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will wait for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes less time to get home, he is the winner. The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will wait for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we sum the total number of tires inflated:
\[10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}\]

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so we need to find out how much change he receives:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries in total.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end to the beginning:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
  - Each day, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
  - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
  - Total hours for 3 days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
  - Each day, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
  - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
  - Total hours for 2 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from all five days to get the total weekly hours:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (MWF)} + 8 \text{ hours (TT)} = 17 \text{ hours per week} \]

Next, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks in the semester:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[

   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls in inches: \( 300 \times 4 = 1200 \) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants in inches: \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) inches long.
   - Total length of baguettes in inches: \( 60 \times 24 = 1440 \) inches.

Next, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[ 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[ 3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly requirement: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) bananas

2. **Gorillas:**

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's list the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, we sum up the costs of the items that are not included in the computer price:
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total additional cost = €157 + €74 + €102 = €333

Next, we add this total to the cost of the computer:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

2. **Sally Four's age:**
   Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

3. **Granny Red's age:**
   Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Sally Two's age:**
   Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Therefore, Sally Two's age is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:
\[
8 \text{ (Sally Thirtytwo)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} = 41
\]

The total age of the four birds is:
\[
\boxed{41}

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{18000}

"To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on peeling and cutting each potato and then multiply by the total number of potatoes.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.

Since there are 60 potatoes, we need to find the total time for peeling and cutting all of them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling all potatoes.**
- Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to peel 60 potatoes = \( 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting all potatoes.**
- Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} \)
- Total time to cut 60 potatoes = \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds} \)

**Step 3: Convert the total cutting time from seconds to minutes.**
- 300 seconds = \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes} \)

**Step 4: Add the total time for peeling and cutting.**
- Total time for peeling = 90 minutes
- Total time for cutting = 5 minutes
- Total time to prep all potatoes = \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \)

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[
\boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}
\]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They made a profit of $25.
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of lemons and sugar.
   - The profit is given by the total revenue minus the total cost: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).
   - Therefore, \( 25 = \text{Total Revenue} - C \).

2. **Express the total revenue in terms of the number of glasses sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of glasses sold.
   - Each glass is sold for $0.50, so the total revenue is \( 0.50x \).

3. **Express the total cost in terms of the number of gallons made:**
   - Let \( g \) be the number of gallons made.
   - Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for \( g \) gallons is \( 5g \).

4. **Relate the number of glasses to the number of gallons:**
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon, so \( x = 20g \).

5. **Substitute \( x \) and \( C \) into the profit equation:**
   - Substitute \( x = 20g \) into the total revenue equation: \( \text{Total Revenue} = 0.50 \times 20g = 10g \).
   - Substitute \( C = 5g \) into the profit equation: \( 25 = 10g - 5g \).

6. **Solve for \( g \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 25 = 5g \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( g = 5 \).

7. **Calculate the total cost of lemons:**
   - The cost of lemons per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons is \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) dollars.

The total amount spent on lemons is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Chinese participants:**
   - Total participants: 240
   - Japanese participants: 80
   - Chinese participants: \( 240 - 80 = 160 \)

2. **Determine the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   - Number of boys on the Chinese team: 60
   - Number of girls on the Chinese team: \( 160 - 60 = 100 \)

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we calculate the remaining amount after these expenses.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining after donation**: Subtract the donation from the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Giving money to daughter and wife**: Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given to daughter and wife} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final remaining amount**: Subtract the amount given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Final remaining amount} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To determine the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of crabs Bo has.
2. Use Bo's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Monic has.
3. Use Monic's number of crabs to find out how many crabs Rani has.
4. Sum the number of crabs each person has.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs. So, we can write:
\[ \text{Bo's crabs} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Monic has as follows:
\[ \text{Monic's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Then, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Therefore, we can calculate the number of crabs Rani has as follows:
\[ \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46 \]

Now, we sum the number of crabs each person has to find the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

Thus, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate his earnings for the first week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate his earnings for the second week:
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\boxed{130}\) dollars for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Given that the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner received as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of white carnations:**
   Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Let \( W \) represent the number of white carnations.
   \[
   5W = 200
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses.
   \[
   R = 4W
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( W \):
   \[
   R = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jean's current age.
   - Let \( M \) be Mark's current age.
   - We are given that Jan's current age is 30, so \( J = 30 \).

2. **Express Jean's age in terms of Mark's age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so \( J = M + 2 \).
   - Since \( J = 30 \), we can substitute to find Mark's age:
     \[
     30 = M + 2
     \]
     Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 30 - 2 = 28
     \]

3. **Use the information about their ages two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Jean's age was \( J - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 \).
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26 \).
   - We are also given that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( 30 - 2 = 28 \), so half of Jan's age was \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).
   - Therefore, two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than 14:
     \[
     26 = 14 + 5
     \]
     This confirms our values for Jean's and Mark's current ages.

4. **Final answer:**
   - Jean's current age is \( 30 \).

\[
\boxed{30}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

Each member of the well-rounded team runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The less well-rounded team's times are as follows:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Adding these times together gives the total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The difference in time is:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team will win by \boxed{2} seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number greater than 3}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to a percentage
To express the difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer
Jerry is \(\boxed{25\%}\) more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, add Jenna's apples to her mom's apples: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

**Final Answer:**

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the given information about the distribution of straw.

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Therefore, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
   - The total straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).

2. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \).

3. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
   - The total straw given to the rabbits is 20.

The total straw distributed among all the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
18r + 50h = 160
\]

We need to find the values of \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. Since the problem does not provide additional information about the number of hamsters, we will focus on solving for \( r \) using the given total straw.

To find \( r \), we need to test integer values for \( h \) that make \( 18r \) an integer and satisfy the equation:

\[
18r = 160 - 50h
\]

We will test values of \( h \) starting from 0:

- If \( h = 0 \):
  \[
  18r = 160 \implies r = \frac{160}{18} \approx 8.89 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- If \( h = 1 \):
  \[
  18r = 110 \implies r = \frac{110}{18} \approx 6.11 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- If \( h = 2 \):
  \[
  18r = 60 \implies r = \frac{60}{18} \approx 3.33 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- If \( h = 3 \):
  \[
  18r = 10 \implies r = \frac{10}{18} \approx 0.56 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

- If \( h = 4 \):
  \[
  18r = -40 \quad (\text{not possible since \( r \) must be non-negative})
  \]

Since none of these values for \( h \) result in an integer \( r \), we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints. Given the problem's context, it's likely that the number of hamsters is not specified, and we need to find a feasible integer solution for \( r \).

Given the constraints and the need for an integer solution, we can assume the simplest feasible scenario where the number of hamsters is minimal or zero. Let's assume \( h = 0 \):

1. **Initial Principal**: $100
2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**."
"To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost per bag, the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags sold.

1. **Calculate the total cost per bag:**
   - Cost of buying each bag: $20
   - Cost of transporting each bag: $2
   - Total cost per bag: \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars

2. **Define the number of bags sold as \( x \):**
   - Total cost for \( x \) bags: \( 22x \) dollars

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Selling price per bag: $30
   - Total revenue for \( x \) bags: \( 30x \) dollars

4. **Determine the profit:**
   - Profit is given as $400
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost
   - Therefore, \( 30x - 22x = 400 \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8}
   \]
   \[
   x = 50

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost of the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Determine how many peaches he collects per minute.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly requirement for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly requirement by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in the number of trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Number of trees left**: Subtract the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Now, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. Since each pen costs $1.50, the cost of 8 pens is:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we sum up all the cards she had initially and the cards she collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

To find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to follow these steps:

5. **Identify the lowest score among the first five tests:**
   - The lowest score is 71.

6. **Calculate the adjusted total score after removing the lowest score:**
   - If 71 is removed, the adjusted total score is \( 438 - 71 = 367 \).

7. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   \[
   \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   367 + x = 93 \times 5

     6000 - 1200 = 4800
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost of one dozen cups is:
     \[
     \frac{4800}{20} = 240
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is:
     \[
     \frac{240}{12} = 20
     \]

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and the shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting and mowing the lawn:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. She earns $4 each time, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.
- Sara already has $10 saved, so her total savings before mowing the lawn are \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

We need to find out how many times Sara must mow the lawn to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. The equation for her total savings is:
\[30 + 4x = 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:
\[4x = 70 - 30\]
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4}\]
\[x = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be written as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a constant speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and the speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day.
   - Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.

2. Determine the number of customers on the second day.
   - The second day had 50 more customers than the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. Let the number of customers on the third day be \(x\).

4. According to the problem, the total number of customers over the three days is 500.
   - This can be expressed as the sum of the customers from each day: \(100 + 150 + x = 500\).

5. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   100 + 150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   250 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00. Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to determine the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: Identify the number of roses.
The problem states there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dahlias.
The problem states there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, the number of dahlias is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers.
The total number of flowers is the sum of the roses and the dahlias:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's current age is given as 21 years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be:
  \[
  21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Adrian's age in three years will be:
  \[
  63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
  \]
- Zack's age in three years will be:
  \[
  42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
  \]

Now, we find the average age of the three in three years. The average age is calculated by summing their ages and dividing by the number of individuals:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total points scored by the four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, calculate the points scored by Yuri:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, calculate the points scored by Brianna:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent solving puzzles, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on Sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
- Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles is:
  \[
  10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on Sudoku puzzles:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank to water her garden. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\) liters."
"First, let's determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated as follows:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

So, Andy plants 50 petunias. Now, to find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[
\frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year. To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the amounts spent each year:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \(\boxed{20000}\)."

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of Pokemon card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has now:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is calculated by dividing the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{3200}{96} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:

"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order step by step:

1. **Base burrito**: $6.50
2. **Extra meat**: $2.00
3. **Extra cheese**: $1.00
4. **Avocado**: $1.00
5. **2 sauces**: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. **Upgrade for chips and a drink**: $3.00

First, we add up all the individual costs:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Next, Chad uses a $5.00 gift card at checkout. So, we subtract the value of the gift card from the total cost:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:

"First, let's determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens. These are all full pens.

2. **First Cycle of Refilling:**
   - After using 25 pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
   - He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
   - Therefore, from 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) full pens.
   - Now, he has 5 new full pens and 0 empty pens.

3. **Second Cycle of Refilling:**
   - He uses these 5 new full pens, which will leave him with 5 empty pens.
   - He can mix the ink from these 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
   - Now, he has 1 new full pen and 0 empty pens.

4. **Third Cycle of Refilling:**
   - He uses this 1 new full pen, which will leave him with 1 empty pen.
   - He cannot make any more full pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.

So, after the first cycle, he has 5 new full pens, and after the second cycle, he has 1 new full pen. Adding these to the original 25 pens, the total number of pens he has is:
\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. Determine the number of students who went out through exit C by subtracting the students who went out through exits A and B from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students who went out through exit C} = 700 - 420 = 280

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Since John has 54 candies, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so the difference is:

"To determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora, we need to consider the books each of them reads.

1. Dolly has two books. If Dolly reads her own two books and also reads Pandora's one book, she will read a total of:
   \[
   2 \text{ (her own books)} + 1 \text{ (Pandora's book)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

2. Pandora has one book. If Pandora reads her own book and also reads Dolly's two books, she will read a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (her own book)} + 2 \text{ (Dolly's books)} = 3 \text{ books}
   \]

3. To find the total number of books read collectively by both Dolly and Pandora, we add the number of books each of them reads:
   \[
   3 \text{ (Dolly's total)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora's total)} = 6 \text{ books}
   \]

Thus, the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora collectively is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"First, let's determine the number of pen pals Mike still has after he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Initially, he had 5 pen pals and he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}\]

Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pages per week}\]

Since Mike has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he needs to write in response is:

\[3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ pages per week}\]

Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many minutes he spends writing a week, we multiply the total number of pages by the time it takes to write one page:

\[30 \times 6 = 180 \text{ minutes per week}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours per week}\]

So, the number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[\boxed{3}\]"

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from his monthly plan of 1000 minutes:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Griffin had at each stage and how many fries Ginger gave him.

1. **Initial number of fries Griffin had:**
   Griffin started with 24 fries.

2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle took 5 fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin had:
   \[
   9 + x \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final number of fries Griffin had:**
   We know that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin \(\boxed{20}\) fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the problem into several steps and calculate the time for each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat from room temperature to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken is 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Therefore, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**

"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \text{ ads} \times 5 \text{ dollars/ad} = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost of television ads} = 15 \text{ ads} \times 75 \text{ dollars/ad} = 1125 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) blue golf balls.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
4

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the number of M&Ms from all three bags to find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought:

\[
300 + 312 + 150 = 762
\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house in the bedrooms is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses:**
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

4. **Calculate the total number of additional windows for both houses:**
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of windows between the houses:**
   - Add the total number of windows in the bedrooms to the total number of additional windows:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the change the mother receives, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought. The items and their costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

First, add the cost of the cocoa and the laundry:

\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]

Next, add the cost of the pasta:

\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:

\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we need to first calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body of the sweater.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches for the sleeves:**
   The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, and the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. Subtract the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches to find the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   Since there are two sleeves, divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40

\[
\text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30

\[
\text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
\]

Now, we sum the total costs for both types of seeds:
\[
\text{Total cost for all seeds} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\)."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Summing up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

1. **Total Cards**: Carly had 80 cards.

2. **Cards with the letter A**: 
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \text{ of } 80 = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Remaining Cards after A**: 
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards with the letter B**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 48 = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Remaining Cards after B**: 
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Cards with the letter C**: 
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \text{ of } 24 = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards}
   \]

"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, the time spent is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time spent digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, the time spent is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both small and large holes to get the total time in minutes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be their current sum of ages plus 20 years (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco).

Given that their current sum of ages is 20, in 10 years, the sum will be:

\[ 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40."
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently \( 6 \) years old.

To verify, we calculate Ruby's current age:
\[ R = 6S = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

In 9 years, Sam will be \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 36 + 9 = 45 \) years old. We check if Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years:
\[ 45 = 3 \times 15 \]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles:
\[
20 \text{ popsicles} \times \$0.25 \text{ per popsicle} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
\[
4 \text{ ice cream bars} \times \$0.50 \text{ per ice cream bar} = 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of spots on a mamba} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. Since there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots:

\[ \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100 \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \text{Half the combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\). Adding the 12 team members and 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, the number of pizzas needed is \(\frac{39}{3} = 13\).

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost for 13 pizzas is \(13 \times 15 = 195\).

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   \[
   \text{Total length of topaz gemstones} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining length for the sterling silver beads:**
   - Each necklace is made to a total length of 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length.
   \[
   \text{Remaining length for sterling silver beads} = 25 - 8 = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
   - Divide the remaining length by the length of one sterling silver bead.
   \[
   \text{Number of sterling silver beads} = \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68

"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of stories each person wrote in the second week.
2. Add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person.
3. Sum the total number of stories written by all three.

First, let's determine the number of stories each person wrote in the second week. Since they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so in the second week he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so in the second week she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add the number of stories written in the first week to the number of stories written in the second week for each person:

- Alani wrote \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories in total.
- Braylen wrote \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories in total.
- Margot wrote \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories in total.

Finally, we sum the total number of stories written by all three:

\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars used in the 3-star and 6-star rows.

1. Calculate the number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of stars in the two rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. Add the stars from the 8-star rows and the 6-star rows to find the total number of stars used in these rows:
   \[
   24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. Subtract the number of stars used in the 8-star and 6-star rows from the total number of stars (76) to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

5. Determine the number of 5-star rows by dividing the number of remaining stars by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows}
   \]

Thus, the number of 5-star rows on the flag is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with each truck carrying a maximum of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trucks are needed:**
   Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Since the result is a whole number, no additional trucks are needed. Therefore, the number of trucks required is:

"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we can calculate Izzy's medals as follows:

\[ \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ \text{Total medals of Ali and Izzy} = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 39 = \frac{x}{10} \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

\[ x = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets, so the total number of chocolate bars is:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, each child will get:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

Therefore, each child will get:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide 150 by 10:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

1. **Mike's points**: Mike has 21 points.
2. **Jim's points**: Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. **Tony's points**: Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we need to check if each player has over 20 points to see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:

1. **Mike's points after the fourth round**: Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Therefore, Mike now has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
2. **Jim's points after the fourth round**: Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Therefore, Jim still has 18 points.
3. **Tony's points after the fourth round**: Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Therefore, Tony now has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the fourth round:

\[
22 \text{ (Mike's points)} + 18 \text{ (Jim's points)} + 43 \text{ (Tony's points)} = 83
\]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, let's determine the ages of Will's sons:
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each son washes:
- The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
- The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.

Now, we find the total number of oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Will originally bought 15 oranges. To find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of oranges left unwashed is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Let's break down the activities Darren does on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220

**Total Squats:**
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60

Finally, we sum up all the activities:
220 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = 370

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily rice consumption:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, each person consumes \(0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}\).
   - For 5 people, the total daily consumption is \(0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2 \, \text{kg/day}\).

2. **Calculate the total weekly rice consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly consumption is \(2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}\).

3. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks the rice will last is \(\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Monday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Tuesday: 15 crates.
- Wednesday: 12 crates.
- Thursday: 18 crates.
- Friday: Closed, so 0 crates.
- Saturday: 20 crates.
- Sunday: 20 crates.

Now, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Sunday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 + 20 = 85 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 85 = 35 \]

So, Sam was off by \(\boxed{35}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to calculate the sequence of bids and sum them up.

1. **Initial Bid:**
   - Carmen starts with the opening bid of $200.

2. **Bids by Other Participants:**
   - Each of the 3 other participants bids once, and each bid increases by $50 from the previous bid.
   - The first additional bid by another participant: \(200 + 50 = 250\)
   - The second additional bid by another participant: \(250 + 50 = 300\)
   - The third additional bid by another participant: \(300 + 50 = 350\)

3. **Carmen's Bids:**
   - Carmen bids after each of the 3 other participants, and each of her bids is $50 more than the previous bid.
   - Carmen's first bid: \(250\)
   - Carmen's second bid: \(300\)
   - Carmen's third bid: \(350\)

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Sum of all bids:
     \[
     200 + 250 + 300 + 350
     \]

5. **Perform the Addition:**
   - First, add the initial bid and the first additional bid:
     \[
     200 + 250 = 450
     \]
   - Next, add the second additional bid:
     \[
     450 + 300 = 750
     \]
   - Finally, add the third additional bid:
     \[
     750 + 350 = 1100
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the desk for Carmen is \(\boxed{1100}\) dollars."
"To determine how much John pays annually for the driving service, we need to break down the costs into several components and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the daily distance traveled:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to travel to and from work each day.
   - Daily distance = 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles.

2. **Calculate the weekly distance traveled:**
   - John works 5 days a week.
   - Weekly distance = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

3. **Calculate the annual distance traveled:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - Annual distance = 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

4. **Calculate the cost per mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile.
   - Annual cost for miles = 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000.

5. **Calculate the monthly bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month.
   - Annual bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

6. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Total annual cost = Annual cost for miles + Annual bonus
   - Total annual cost = $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[
\boxed{31800}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

- On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
- On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

Adding these together:
\[ 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to calculate:
\[ 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes} = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the structure of the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, can produce two pages (one on the left front, one on the left back, one on the right front, and one on the right back, but only two are visible in a typical tabloid format).

Given that a 32-page tabloid requires pages to be printed in a way that each sheet of paper provides two pages, we can calculate the number of sheets as follows:

1. Each sheet of paper provides 2 pages.
2. For 32 pages, we need \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) sheets of paper.

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, she had:

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the amount left after spending on rides is:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annika has left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (the third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).
   - The number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold in the current year, so it is \( 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is \( 250 - 50 = 200 \).
   - The number of books sold in the second year is the total sold minus the books sold in the first and third years:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - The total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     65 \times 20 = 1300
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"First, let's calculate Watson's weekly earnings from his hourly wage. Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week} \]

At a rate of $10 per hour, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings, including the bonus, are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

Next, we need to determine the number of weeks in April. April typically has 4 weeks. Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

This means that after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon (and also in the evening) is:

\[ \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's determine how much weight Joey loses per week. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so the weekly weight loss for Joey is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a single week, which is 2 pounds. However, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 1 week. Therefore, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, which is the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, and Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds (the same as Joey in one week), we can calculate the total weeks Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

So, it will take Sandy 8 weeks to lose 8 pounds. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5

Next, we calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to get the total savings:

- Total savings: $4 (from ice cream) + $2 (from milk) = $6

So, the total amount saved is $6."
"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will grow based on the given intervals.

1. **Calculate the number of extra arms:**
   - Extra arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Calculate the number of extra legs:**
   - Extra legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs is given by:
     \[
     \frac{15}{5} = 3
     \]
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8
     \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 suitcases. Each suitcase costs $50:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

The total amount Theo has initially is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is the total amount he can spend minus the total cost of the suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each per day, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each per day, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the total number of eggs consumed per day by the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, over the course of a week (7 days), the family will consume \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

**Final Answer:**
91"
"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know Quinn's age is 30.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, we can calculate Trent's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's start by defining the variables and using the information given in the problem.

1. Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
2. Cera's current age is 46 years.
3. Six years ago, Cera's age was \( 46 - 6 = 40 \) years.
4. Six years ago, Noah's age was \( N - 6 \) years.
5. According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   N - 6 = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( N \):
   \[
   N = 20 + 6 = 26
   \]
   So, Noah's current age is 26 years.

6. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was:
   \[
   3000 \times 20 = 60000
   \]
7. The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is:
   \[
   60000 \times 2 = 120000
   \]

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for the party is the total number of people invited minus the number of people who couldn't come:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the final number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Marbles bought from Johanna:**

2. **Initial marbles in the store:**
   The store already had 50 marbles.

3. **Total marbles before receiving from his father:**
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
   \]

4. **Marbles given by his father:**
   His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
   \]

5. **Total marbles after receiving from his father:**
   \[
   70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}
   \]

6. **Weight of each marble:**
   Each marble weighs 2 kgs.

7. **Total weight of all marbles:**

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet with a depth of 5 feet.
   - The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.10 per cubic foot.
   - The total cost \( C \) is calculated by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
     \[
     C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. **Number of Girls:**
   - The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
   - Number of girls = \(3 \times 30 = 90\).

2. **Number of Nongendered Children:**
   - The classroom has \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many nongendered children as boys.
   - Number of nongendered children = \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

3. **Total Number of Children:**
   - Total number of children = Number of boys + Number of girls + Number of nongendered children.
   - Total number of children = \(30 + 90 + 3 = 123\).

The total number of children in the classroom is \(123\)."
"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \), which means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
3. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion based on the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
4. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
5. Solving for \( P \):
   \[
   P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
   \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"First, let's determine the total number of people at the beginning of the party:
\[ 25 \text{ men} + 15 \text{ women} = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, we calculate how many people left after an hour. Since \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This means that the number of people remaining at the party is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people} \]

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Therefore, the number of women who stayed can be found by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed:
\[ 30 \text{ people} - 22 \text{ men} = 8 \text{ women} \]

Thus, the number of women left at the party is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the magazine. Since the magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4, the magazine costs:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the pen. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the pen costs \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. This can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, the number of pencils in the boxes is:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total. Meg has 46 pencils. To find out the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add the number of pencils each has:

\[ \text{Total number of pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold the same number of pencils as the boxes Jam has (which is 24 pencils per box), we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{24} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need \(\boxed{3}\) boxes to store all their pencils."
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the additional liquid from the cream.

First, let's calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, the number of ice cubes required is:
\[
\frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Next, we need to determine the weakening effect of these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the ice cubes is:
\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the cream is:
\[
15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

To find the total weakening effect, we add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Thus, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to understand the trade ratio and the outcome of the trades.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records given up} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records. 

**Final Answer:**
14"
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be found by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we need to determine the monthly salary of a senior programmer. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, and each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[
\text{Monthly salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

Now, we can calculate the total monthly payment to all the junior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Similarly, we can calculate the total monthly payment to all the senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to the junior and senior programmers:

\[

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial lollipops:**
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school:**
   Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22
   \]

3. **Lollipops given to friends:**
   Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8
   \]

4. **Lollipops bought on the way home:**
   Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36
   \]

5. **Lollipops eaten later:**
   Oscar eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning. So, he eats:
   \[
   3 + 2 = 5
   \]
   Subtracting these from the total:
   \[
   36 - 5 = 31
   \]

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]"
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the number of percentage points that need to be charged. The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is a difference of:

\[ 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Next, we know that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we multiply the number of percentage points by the time it takes to recharge each percentage point:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

   \]
   Now, Erin has 17 lollipops.
3. Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. So, we subtract these from her current total:
   \[
   17 - 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of lollipops Erin has left is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of the reward off the price. 

\[ \text{Amount taken off by the coupon} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount the customer paid after applying the reward and the coupon:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Annual salary: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Taxes: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Taxes: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs to determine which job has a higher net pay and by how much.

**Net pay comparison:**
- Job A net pay: $24,000
- Job B net pay: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B)."

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 8 batches, the total sugar needed is \( 8 \times 30 = 240 \) ounces.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Therefore, for 1 batch, the total sugar needed is \( 1 \times 70 = 70 \) ounces.

Now, add the amounts of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
- Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces.

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs is \(\boxed{310}\) ounces."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Total initial investment = \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \) dollars.

2. **Value after the first year:**
   - The stock price increases by 50%.
   - New price per share = \( 8 + (0.50 \times 8) = 8 + 4 = 12 \) dollars.
   - Value of 8 shares after the first year = \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) dollars.

3. **Value after the second year:**
   - The stock price decreases by 25%.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."

   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   H = 2C
   \]

3. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[
   H + C = 60
   \]

4. Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[
   2C + C = 60
   \]
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
   \[
   C = 20
   \]

5. Now, find the number of chickens:

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Jenny's son takes for his lunch each week. Since he takes 4 cookies 5 days a week, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. Since he eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, we have:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we add the cookies taken by her son and her husband to find the total number of cookies consumed by them each week:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Since Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week and each bag contains 36 cookies, the number of cookies Jenny eats is the total number of cookies minus the number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the cost would be:

"First, let's calculate the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \, \text{tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Next, let's calculate the daily revenue from silos:

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \, \text{silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

Now, we need to find the increase in daily revenue:

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Original daily revenue}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"First, let's break down the time John spent on each activity:

1. **Boating**: John spends 6 hours boating.
2. **Swimming**: He spends half the time he spends boating swimming, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.
3. **Watching Shows**: He watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to first calculate the total cost of the activities and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her $90 budget.

1. **Cost of Mini-Golf:**
   - Morgan and her friends each need to play one round of mini-golf.
   - Cost per round of mini-golf: $5
   - Let \( n \) be the number of friends Morgan can invite. Including Morgan, the total number of people is \( n + 1 \).
   - Total cost for mini-golf: \( 5 \times (n + 1) \)

2. **Cost of Arcade Tokens:**
   - Morgan wants to have $5 in arcade tokens.
   - Total cost for arcade tokens: $5

3. **Cost of Go-Karts:**
   - Morgan and her friends each want to ride the go-karts twice.
   - Cost per ride: $10
   - Total cost per person for go-karts: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \)
   - Total cost for go-karts for \( n + 1 \) people: \( 20 \times (n + 1) \)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of all costs: \( 5 \times (n + 1) + 5 + 20 \times (n + 1) \)
   - Simplify the expression: \( 5(n + 1) + 5 + 20(n + 1) = 5n + 5 + 5 + 20n + 20 = 25n + 30 \)

5. **Budget Constraint:**
   - Morgan's budget is $90.
   - Set up the inequality: \( 25n + 30 \leq 90 \)

6. **Solve for \( n \):**
   - Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 25n \leq 60 \)
   - Divide by 25: \( n \leq \frac{60}{25} = 2.4 \)

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite is 2.

**Final Answer:**
Morgan can invite 2 friends."
"First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops every day. Therefore, the total cost of lollipops per day is:

\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how much money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ \$5 - \$1 = \$4 \]

Marisa saves this amount every day. To find out how much she saves in 5 days, we multiply the daily savings by 5:

\[ \$4 \text{ per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$20 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the cost of \( x \) pounds of candy is \( 1.5x \) dollars.
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money and spends it on gumballs.
   - The amount of money he takes is \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} \).
   - Each gumball costs $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, we have the equation: \( \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{10 - 1.5x}{2} = 2
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   -1.5x = 4 - 10
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   -1.5x = -6
   \]
   Divide both sides by -1.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{-6}{-1.5} = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This can be written as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is \(\boxed{25}\) years old."
"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles, we divide 18,000 by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train needs service every 20 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. According to the problem, a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing required:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:
\[
\boxed{23}

   - Distance: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
   - Speed: 70 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Distance: 240 miles
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: \(\frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add the times for both segments to find the total time of the trip:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total time John spent on his trip is \(\boxed{6}\) hours."

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Sara currently has 8 points. Therefore, Erin's current points can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Since Erin's current points are 24 and she just scored 14 points, we can find out how many points she had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from her current points:
\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before is:

   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, on Friday, the store sold \( 14 \times 2 = 28 \) shoes.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - The store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, on Saturday, the store sold \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to individual shoes, the store sold \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - The store sold one-half the amount of shoes sold on Saturday.
   - Therefore, on Sunday, the store sold \( \frac{56}{2} = 28 \) pairs.
   - Converting pairs to individual shoes, the store sold \( 28 \times 2 = 56 \) shoes.

4. **Returns:**
   - On the last day, 6 pairs of shoes were returned.
   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, 6 pairs of shoes returned means \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) shoes were returned.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the total interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal is $3,650, the rate is 10% per year (or 0.10), and the time is 5/12 of a year (since five months is 5/12 of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 = 3650 \times 0.04167 = 152.0833 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 3650 + 152.0833 = 3802.0833 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.0833}{5} = 760.41666 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

The distance Cho hiked is:
\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = \text{Speed}_\text{Cho} \times \text{Time}_\text{Cho} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

The distance Chloe hiked is:
\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = \text{Speed}_\text{Chloe} \times \text{Time}_\text{Chloe} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} - \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

Thus, Cho hiked \(\boxed{67}\) kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine the amount of silver and gold pesos Anna has.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. According to the problem, Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel and 40 more gold pesos than Axel.

So, Anna has:
- \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos
- \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos

Next, we calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos Axel and Anna have together.

For silver pesos:
- Axel: 50
- Anna: 100
- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)

For gold pesos:
- Axel: 80
- Anna: 120
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together to find the total number of pesos they have:
- Total silver and gold pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\)

Thus, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"First, let's determine the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to determine the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes her to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. This is calculated as:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can follow these steps:

1. Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had be \( x \) hectares.
2. According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, so he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left.
3. We know that the amount of land left is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
   \]
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation by isolating \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
   \]
5. Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
   \]

So, the amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is \(\boxed{32}\) hectares."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26
\]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, we sum these scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these together step-by-step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]

"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. According to the problem, he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, we calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Next, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages delivered:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- The ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the total costs:

- David's total cost with the bracelet: \$30.
- Dasha's total cost with individual tickets: \$36.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[
\$36 - \$30 = \$6
\]

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica needs to wrap 12 gifts in total.

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles can be expressed as:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

Therefore, Sam has \(\boxed{15}\) more popsicles than Betty."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for bundling these services. The discount amount is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we compare this to the cost of the cable subscription, which is $60 per month. The savings by cancelling the cable subscription and subscribing to the bundled streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's break down the time Carol spends on each activity:

1. **Writing a song**: 4 hours
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Next, we calculate the total work time by summing up the time spent on each activity:
\[

"First, let's determine how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

"First, let's determine the number of millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, the number of millipedes is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

Next, we need to find the number of stink bugs. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Since there are 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:

\[
2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

Now, we can find the total number of bugs by adding the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[
90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[
\boxed{168}

"First, let's determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day. This means he uses the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, we find the daily savings in energy consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of stripes on all the zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
   \]

2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   36 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. Another zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
   \]

Next, we sum the total number of stripes:
\[
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
\]

Now, we count the total number of zebras:
\[
2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ zebras}
\]

To find the average number of stripes per zebra, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[
\frac{88}{4} = 22
\]

Thus, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[
\boxed{22}

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. There are 20 people in total.
   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of meat} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pounds of cheese} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   \[

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of corns in Allan's house.
2. Calculate the new number of cannolis after Allan bought more.
3. Calculate the new number of corns after Allan bought more.
4. Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis.

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of corns.**

We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis initially. Therefore, the initial number of corns is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new number of cannolis.**

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the new number of corns.**

Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought. Since he bought 60 more cannolis, the number of corns he bought is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]
So, the new number of corns is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

**Step 4: Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis.**

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

Thus, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it will take Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. Therefore, the total time he has before he needs to leave is:

\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, we can now determine how many minutes early he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for every 1.5 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (which is half off $3).

Since Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, we can break it down as follows:
- The first pound costs $3.
- The second pound costs $1.50 (which is half of $3).

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the second pack of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice that amount:
\[ 2 \times 400 = 800 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the two packs of fireworks before the discount:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on the fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted price of the fireworks gives:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days:**
   Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
   \[
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}

2. **Determine how many dozens of cookies this is:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies, we convert the total number of cookies into dozens:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of madeleine cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles do explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog:
\[ \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a direct relationship between the two defects (exploding and smelling like wet dog), we assume that the defects are independent. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each event happening independently:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode} = \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \times \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) \times 50,000 = \frac{1 \times 5}{100 \times 100} \times 50,000 = \frac{5}{10,000} \times 50,000 = 2.5 \]

Since the number of candles must be a whole number, we round 2.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picks.

First, let's find the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. A 30% discount means the price is reduced by 30%, so the customer pays 70% of the original price.

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times (1 - 0.30) = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Apples gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

2. **Apples gathered by Joanne's sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

3. **Total apples gathered by both:**
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne: \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).
   - Total apples gathered by Joanne's sister: \( 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \).
   - Combined total: \( 45 + x + 105 = 150 + x \).

4. **Given that the combined total is 500 apples:**
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 500 - 150 = 350
   \]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances he traveled each segment of the trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day (5th day):**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the 5th day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[
\boxed{3140}

"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Peter's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is given as 5 cubic inches.

2. **Zack's Locker Size:**
   Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we can express Zack's locker size in terms of Peter's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker size} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Timothy's Locker Size:**
   Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can express Timothy's locker size in terms of Zack's locker size:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker size} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"First, we determine the elevation where Stanley's comb is located. Stanley was initially at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and the comb fell 4,000 feet. Therefore, the comb is now at:

\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 4,000 \text{ feet} = 6,000 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach this elevation. Oliver is currently at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To find the difference in elevation between Oliver's current position and the comb's location, we calculate:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(\boxed{3000}\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the amount of money given by the first bank.
2. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
3. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue's total capital now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, four boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cats} \]
So, the number of cats left after the boats took some away is:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats} \]
So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats} \]

The final number of cats left on the rock is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 per month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 per month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 10 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months) at $14 per month:**
   \[
   10 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$140
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs from each period:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
\]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{284}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. According to the problem, he saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars from the jogger jeans} \]
and
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars from the tattered jeans} \]

Now, let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). The original price of the tattered jeans is given as $28, so \( T = 28 \). The original price of the jogger jeans is \( J \). The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, so the savings on the jogger jeans is:
\[ J - 22 \]
The savings on the tattered jeans is $4, so the sale price of the tattered jeans is:
\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]
Thus, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. Therefore, the difference is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

\[
240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"To determine how many birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought feeder.
   - Therefore, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:**
   - There are 3 store-bought feeders.
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Total birds from store-bought feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds.

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:**
   - There are 3 homemade feeders.
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.
   - Total birds from homemade feeders = 3 × 30 = 90 birds.

5. **Calculate the total number of birds in the garden:**

   - Total birds = 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

Thus, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the bagel:**
   The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup:**
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake:**
   The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, we calculate half of the bagel's cost:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

4. **Total cost:**
   Now, we sum the costs of the bagel, soup, and cake:
   \[

Thus, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the ticket} = \$100
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Kenny has left after buying the ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny made from selling the cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total money made} = \text{Cost of the ticket} + \text{Money left} = \$100 + \$50 = \$150
   \]

4. **Determine the price per card:**
   \[
   \text{Price per card} = \$1.5
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny sold:**
   \[
   \text{Total cards sold} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per card}} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100
   \]

6. **Understand that Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and sells the rest:**
   \[
   \text{Cards kept} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cards sold} = \text{Total cards} - \text{Cards kept}
   \]

7. **Set up the equation for the cards sold:**
   \[
   \text{Cards sold} = \text{Total cards} - \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cards sold} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]

8. **Substitute the number of cards sold with the value we calculated:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - These 18 guests each get 2 hotdogs, so the caterer prepared \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs for the first round.

2. **Calculate the total number of guests and their hotdog requirements:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and each guest wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs needed for a second hotdog for all guests is \( 40 \times 1 = 40 \) hotdogs (since each guest wants one more hotdog).

3. **Determine the shortfall in hotdogs:**
   - The caterer only prepared 36 hotdogs initially.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed for the second round is 40.
   - The shortfall in hotdogs is \( 40 - 36 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Since 4 hotdogs are short, 4 guests will not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

Half of the letters in Indras' name is:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Adding 4 to this number gives:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name to find the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final amount for Charlotte's order is:

- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:

Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many lollipops each of his four friends received. Since the 20 lollipops were shared equally among his four friends, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

Each piece would weigh:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces they ate is:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

**Final Answer: 15 ounces**"

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing the oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's determine the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, the drive for Bernadette will take:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before that, which means she needs to arrive 4 - 5 = -1 minutes, or simply 1 minute before Wayne's arrival time. However, since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before Wayne leaves to ensure she arrives 1 minute before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
     \[
     3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the width of the room:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet. So, we can solve for the width:
     \[
     360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width}
     \]
     \[
     \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet}
     \]

The perimeter of the room is \(\boxed{98}\) feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
1 \text{ pack of red beads} + 2 \text{ packs of clear beads} = 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Similarly, we can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

\[
3 \text{ packs of blue beads} + 4 \text{ packs of red beads} = 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth. We do this by subtracting the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

\[
140 - 60 = 80
\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature of Marcus's house.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   - The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking Process:**
   - Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
   - The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - Total temperature increase from baking: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}\).
   - New temperature after baking: \(40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Cooling Process:**
   - Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes.
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Total cooling time: 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes: \(30 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 3 \text{ intervals}\).
   - Total temperature decrease from cooling: \(3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).
   - New temperature after cooling: \(55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."

"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Hay per mile}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bails} \times \text{Cost per bail}

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Next, we calculate Marcy's new total points after her turn. Marcy initially has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's new totals to determine by how many points Joey is winning:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total number of sneakers} - \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue:**

"To determine the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we need to calculate the number of crayons in the two different types of packets separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of crayons in the six packets that each contain 8 pieces:
\[ 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons per packet} = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons per packet} = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

First, we need to determine the total cost if you buy the super ticket and the additional popcorn and soda:
- The super ticket costs $20.
- The additional popcorn and soda cost $1 extra.
- Therefore, the total cost with the super ticket is $20 + $1 = $21.

Next, we need to determine the total cost if you buy a regular movie ticket and a regular popcorn and soda:
- The regular movie ticket costs $12.
- The regular popcorn costs \(P\) (where \(P\) is the price of the popcorn).
- The soda costs $3.
- Therefore, the total cost without the super ticket is $12 + \(P\) + $3 = $15 + \(P\).

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the regular ticket and the regular popcorn and soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket:
\[15 + P = 21 - 2\]
\[15 + P = 19\]
\[P = 19 - 15\]
\[P = 4\]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, we need to determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. Given that the total cost for 20 balloons was $900, we can calculate the cost per balloon as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[
\text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons at the new price. To find the total cost, we multiply the new cost per balloon by the number of balloons:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = 170 \times 60 + 170 \times 5
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]
\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Adding these results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

Thus, the total amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. For the first part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. For the second part of the trip:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, add the distances to get the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, add the times to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is \(50\) mph."
"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade. Initially, she has 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, so she is left with:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires she has left. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of her 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the value of the 2 rubies she received in the trade. Since each ruby is worth $1200, the value of her 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the two amounts together to get the total number of apples eaten by both in 30 days.

First, let's calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Apples eaten by Marin in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days:
\[ \text{Apples eaten by Nancy in 30 days} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples eaten by Marin and Nancy together:
\[ \text{Total apples eaten in 30 days} = 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days is:

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of green cards. Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we sum up all the cards to find the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest.

After about twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
These 25 fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there, so the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Thus, the number of fairies remaining is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of puppies.
2. Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.
3. Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of puppies.**

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of puppies with spots.**

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

**Step 3: Determine the percentage of puppies with spots.**

The percentage of puppies with spots is calculated by dividing the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \( 42 \times 75 = 3150 \) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \( 20 \times 65 = 1300 \) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - The farmer buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) pounds.

Next, we sum the weights of all the feed:
\[
3150 \text{ (hay)} + 1300 \text{ (oats)} + 48 \text{ (carrots)} + 2 \text{ (sugar cubes)} = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip is not possible):
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Thus, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She recycles three aluminum cans each week, and each can is worth two cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings from recycling plastic bottles. She recycles five plastic bottles each week, and each bottle is worth three cents. Therefore, the weekly earnings from bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, let's find her total weekly earnings from recycling both cans and bottles:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find her total earnings over a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by four:

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since a position can't be negative, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she can't be in a negative position, she moves down to 6th).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(6 + 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.

   He gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he receives:
   \[
   5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his initial count:
   \[
   200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Shoes received on Wednesday:**
   He gains 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he receives:
   \[
   15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current count:
   \[
   210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Shoes received on Friday:**
   He gains 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so he receives:
   \[
   30 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes per pair} = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding these to his current count:
   \[
   240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Shoes removed on Saturday:**
   He gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. Subtracting these from his current count:
   \[
   300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars, we calculate the total number of cupcakes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes/jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes/pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

Therefore, the number of pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we calculate three times the price of the pen:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Then, we subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the piece of paper:

\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost of the items Theo bought:

\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the amount of change Theo received, we subtract the total cost of the items from the $10 she gave:

\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial total number of pencils:**
   Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils.
   \[
   \text{Total initial pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.
   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   Subtract the pencils used from the initial total.
   \[
   \text{Pencils remaining} = 300 - 60 = 240
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.
   \[
   \text{Pencils left} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
   \]

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total. So, we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( \frac{x}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 5 - 2 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ x = 3 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's determine the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches/remora} \times 2 \text{ remoras} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches to make the units consistent. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents. The formula to find the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{combined length of remoras}}{\text{shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is \(\boxed{10}\) percent of the shark's body length."
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how long Jason needs to walk each day, we first need to calculate the total number of days he will be walking over the three weeks.

Since there are 7 days in a week, over three weeks, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Jason plans to walk 4 days a week. Over three weeks, the number of days he will walk is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ days} \]

The total time he needs to spend walking to break in the shoes is 240 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total time by the number of days he will be walking:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each child received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of kids.

First, we find out how many books Sarah bought. Since each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we divide $300 by $15:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of kids. Sarah has 4 kids, so we divide 20 by 4:

\[
\text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received \(\boxed{5}\) books."
"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we need to use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of employees.
   - Each group has 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees is \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each of the 3 groups has 7 tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

3. Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:
   - Add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(600 + 21 = 621\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{621}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel stay. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. 

To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel stay is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each plane ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, we calculate:

\[
\text{Tubes of blue paint Jasper has} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, we calculate:

\[
\text{Tubes of yellow paint Jasper has} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

Now, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint that Jasper has to find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has:

\[
\text{Total tubes of paint Jasper has} = 2 + 9 = 11
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, and the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To determine how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we start by calculating the total amount they have already earned. Keegan earned $83 and Tashay earned $91. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 83 + 91 = 174 \]

Their goal is to raise $200. To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract the amount they have already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

Therefore, they need to earn \(\boxed{26}\) more dollars to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her portable media player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each currently has from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel. We subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. According to the bet, he gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. The problem states that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We can express this relationship with the following steps:

1. Calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

2. Subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:

"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Thus, the cost per individual razor is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"First, let's determine the height of the shortest cheerleader, which is 60 inches. In a human pyramid with the given structure (4 on the bottom, 3 on top of 4, 2 on top of 3, and 1 on top of 2), the shortest cheerleader will be at the top.

The height of the human pyramid will be equal to the height of the shortest cheerleader since the pyramid's height is determined by the topmost person.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert this height into feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.

\[ \text{Height in feet} = \frac{60 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine Angela's current age, let's break down the information given:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett's current age is 14, three times this age is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 years from 42:

\[42 - 4 = 38\]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela is 38 years old.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Paul drives in the morning each day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives 14 mornings.

\[
\text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon each day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives 14 afternoons.

\[
\text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/day} = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 84 \text{ dollars} + 28 \text{ dollars} = 112 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest

The total cost for the first venue can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x \]

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)

The total cost for the second venue can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \), by Lily as \( L \), and by Bodhi as \( B \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Lily found 7 more than David: \( L = D + 7 \)
2. David found half of what Bodhi found: \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) or equivalently \( B = 2D \)
3. Together they collected 43 insects: \( L + D + B = 43 \)

First, substitute \( B \) and \( L \) in terms of \( D \) into the total equation:
\[ L = D + 7 \]
\[ B = 2D \]
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( D = 9 \) back to find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, Lily found \( 16 \) insects.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

First, let's determine how much yarn Mariah used:
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's determine how much yarn Mariah's grandma used:
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. We calculate:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, we add the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}

"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of gifts for the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of gifts for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. Add the gifts for all 5 friends:
   \[
   10 + 6 = 16 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. Add the 10 additional random gifts:
   \[
   16 + 10 = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:

\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Using the width of the rug we just calculated:

\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of the couch is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple.

We know the following:
- The cost of one pack of grape gum is $2.
- The cost of one pack of green apple gum is half the cost of one pack of grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.
- The total cost of all the gum is $7.

The total cost can be expressed as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and the number of sticks he can get from each type of wood. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood}
\]
If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, he will get:
\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with his $24:
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood}
\]
If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, he will get:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood gives him more sticks (1600 sticks) than buying 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood (1200 sticks). Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the total number of legs among Mario's 6 sled dogs. Since each dog has 4 legs, we can calculate the total number of legs as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes are required. Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes is:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:

\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the weekly cost without the pass is:
\[ 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$4.40 \text{ per day} = \$22.00 \text{ per week} \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the cost without the pass and the cost with the pass:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

First, we need to find out how many cows the zoo has. According to the information, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sheep the farm has. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has:
\[ \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ sheep} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo. The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so the total number of animals on the farm is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \]

The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so the total number of animals in the zoo is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Adding the total number of animals from both the farm and the zoo, we get:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( O \) and the number of potatoes she bought as \( P \).

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought:
\[ 4O = 12 \]
\[ 4P = 4 \]

We can solve these equations for \( O \) and \( P \):

\[ O = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
\[ P = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit needed:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Since it takes 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days available:**
   Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - From December 31st to December 31st: 0 days
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July up to July 19th: 19 days

   Adding these together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his total earnings for the week as follows:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Gerald has left is:

"First, let's calculate how much Julie spent on clothes. She spent 20% of her $500 on clothes:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after this purchase:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. We calculate 25% of $400:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we need to find out how much money she has left after this purchase:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the relationship \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \)."

"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, we know that a fight consists of 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. Therefore, the total number of minutes in the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. So, the total number of punches Joe throws in 15 minutes is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes} \times 25 \text{ punches/minute} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Thus, the total number of punches Joe threw is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"First, let's determine how many cookies Josh made. Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, and Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[
\text{Number of cookies Josh made} = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Kelsie made. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Since Josh made 9 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as follows:

\[
\text{Number of cookies Kelsie made} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. The amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour:

1. **Tony**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby**: Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony. Therefore, Bobby picks:
   \[
   6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
3. **Kathy**: Kathy can pick twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby. Therefore, Kathy picks:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
   \]
4. **Ricky**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy. Therefore, Ricky picks:
   \[

"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = number of rows of red tulips + number of rows of blue tulips = 6 + 3 = 9.

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

1. **Current Daily Consumption:**
   \[
   12 \text{ kilowatts per hour} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 288 \text{ kilowatts per day}
   \]

2. **Current Weekly Consumption:**
   \[
   288 \text{ kilowatts per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 2016 \text{ kilowatts per week}
   \]

3. **Current Weekly Cost:**
   \[
   2016 \text{ kilowatts per week} \times \$1.50 \text{ per kilowatt per hour} = \$3024
   \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

4. **New Daily Consumption:**
   \[
   (12 \text{ kilowatts per hour} + 2 \text{ kilowatts per hour}) \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 14 \text{ kilowatts per hour} \times 24 \text{ hours per day} = 336 \text{ kilowatts per day}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 5 days for half a house means 10 days for a whole house).

The rate of one person painting a house is therefore \( \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \).

Now, if we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be \( 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \).

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is \( 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Let's start by defining the variables and relationships given in the problem.

1. Let \( O_s \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has.
2. Let \( O_c \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
3. Let \( J_s \) be the number of sofas Jenna has.
4. Let \( J_c \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.

From the problem, we know:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( O_s = 20 \).
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( O_s = O_c - 2 \) and \( J_s = J_c - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( J_c = 3 \times O_c \).

First, we can find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ O_s = O_c - 2 \]
\[ 20 = O_c - 2 \]
\[ O_c = 22 \]

Next, we can find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ J_c = 3 \times O_c \]
\[ J_c = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ J_c = 66 \]

Now, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ J_s = J_c - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 66 - 2 \]
\[ J_s = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have:
- Total sofas: \( O_s + J_s = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( O_c + J_c = 22 + 66 = 88 \)
- Total number of sofas and chairs: \( 84 + 88 = 172 \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{172}

"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have had $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{\text{Total amount available}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Since Tom originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Additional CDs} = 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, 5 hours, and 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Let's calculate the total hours step by step:

1. \(6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}\)
2. \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\)
3. \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of hours:

2. **First stop:**
   - 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - 5 times as many passengers as those who got off get on the bus.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:
   \[
   48 - 8 + 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than those who got off.
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
   - Calculate the number of passengers after the second stop:

"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we calculate twice Jame's age in 8 years and then subtract 5:
\[ 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55 \]

This means that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55:
\[ 55 - 8 = 47 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years separate Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Given that the computer cost $1,100 and Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can determine the cost of the printer as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of the printer} = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 1100 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine how many seashells each girl brought back, we start by identifying the number of seashells each boy brought back. According to the problem, each boy brought back 60 seashells.

Next, we need to calculate the number of seashells each girl brought back. The problem states that each girl brought back an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by a boy plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Let's denote the number of seashells each boy brought as \( B \) and the number of seashells each girl brought as \( G \).

Given:
\[ B = 60 \]

The number of seashells each girl brought is:
\[ G = B + 4B \]

Substituting the value of \( B \):
\[ G = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]
\[ G = 60 + 240 \]
\[ G = 300 \]

Thus, each girl brought back 300 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"First, we determine how many candies George originally had. Since George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left, we can calculate the original number of candies George had as follows:

\[ \text{Original candies George had} = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we know that Nick had twice as many candies as George originally. Therefore, we calculate the number of candies Nick had as:

\[ \text{Candies Nick had} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, the number of candies Nick has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine Alyana's age. Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, and Chenny is 10 years old, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, we need to find Anne's age. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age:

\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book. Therefore, the thickness of the third book is:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book. Therefore, the thickness of the fourth book is:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

The total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"First, let's calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has already made in the first three weeks.

- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma needs to make a total of 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total number of vlogs she aims to make:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"First, let's calculate the total bill including the 20% tip.

The tip amount is 20% of $50:
\[ \text{Tip} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since the check is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill:
\[ \text{Each Person's Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Therefore, you end up paying:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending $8:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we first need to break down the month into its halves and understand the relationship between the savings in the first and second halves.

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the next 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. So, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \). The total savings in the second half of April would then be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total savings for the month:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, the daily savings in the first half of April is $25. Since the daily savings in the second half of April is twice that of the first half, we have:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit Verna bought.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   \[
   3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = 3 \times 1.50 = \$4.50
   \]

2. **Cost of oranges:**
   \[
   5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = 5 \times 0.80 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Cost of peaches:**
   \[
   6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = 6 \times 0.75 = \$4.50
   \]

Next, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 \text{ (apples)} + \$4.00 \text{ (oranges)} + \$4.50 \text{ (peaches)} = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Thus, the change Verna received is:
\[
\boxed{7}

\text{Jairus's total earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, calculate Jenny's total earnings:
- Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
- She completed 20 tasks.

\[
\text{Jenny's total earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, find the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus will get \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money they are dividing is 100 dollars. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as follows:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, which totals 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned from her sales, we need to break down the commission calculation into two parts: the commission for the first $1000 and the commission for the amount over $1000.

1. **Calculate the commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate for the first $1000 is 30%.
   - Commission amount for the first $1000 = \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \).

2. **Calculate the commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Antonella sold goods worth $2500, so the amount over $1000 is \( 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \).
   - Commission rate for the amount over $1000 is 10%.
   - Commission amount for the amount over $1000 = \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \).

3. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission for the first $1000 + Commission for the amount over $1000.
   - Total commission = \( 300 + 150 = 450 \).

Thus, the total cost for lunch today is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag, we can break the problem into smaller steps.

1. Identify the number of buttons with two holes and the number of buttons with four holes.
   - There are 7 buttons with two holes.
   - The rest of the buttons have four holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total, the number of buttons with four holes is \(21 - 7 = 14\).

2. Calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with two holes.
   - Each of the 7 buttons has 2 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

3. Calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons with four holes.
   - Each of the 14 buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is \(14 \times 4 = 56\).

4. Add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes.
   - The total number of holes is \(14 + 56 = 70\).

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given:

1. Mark's weight is 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is:
   \[
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[
150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (3):
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle from the ground to the sun after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun Relative to the Pyramid:**
   The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.

2. **Rate of Movement:**
   The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

3. **Total Movement in 10 Hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total movement} = 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun:**
   The final angle from the ground to the sun is the sum of the initial angle and the total movement:
   \[
   \text{Final angle} = 32 \, \text{degrees} + 50 \, \text{degrees} = 82 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is **82 degrees**."
"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger. Therefore, the age of the younger son is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the total number of candles required is:

\[ 12 + 8 = 20 \]

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for 4 packs is:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time for the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, the reading rate is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

Using this rate, the number of pages she read in the first week is:
\[ \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's determine how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Next, let's determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

Now, we add the number of sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate to find the total number of sandwiches consumed:

\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches consumed from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:

\[
12 - 7 = 5
\]

So, the number of sandwiches left is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). According to the problem, Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \). At that time, his age will be three times his nephew's age. Therefore, in 7 years, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). We can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

To find \( N \), we subtract 7 from both sides:

\[ N = 17 - 7 \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently \(\boxed{10}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Therefore, for three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since the previous three teeth each received $1.00, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, for two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 0.50 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

4. **Total Amount:**
   - Adding up all the amounts:
     \[
     5 + 3 + 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the total number of goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna, we start by using the information given about Richie's goals and the relationships between the goals scored by the three teenagers.

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can express the number of goals Mark scored as:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Mark} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can express the number of goals Anna scored as:
   \[
   \text{Goals scored by Anna} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Goals scored by Richie} + \text{Goals scored by Mark} + \text{Goals scored by Anna} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[
\boxed{175}

"First, let's determine how much money Peter spends each day from Sunday through Wednesday. Since he spends an equal amount each day and he has $70 to spend over 7 days, he spends:

\[
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
\]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends:

\[
10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[
\frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures}
\]

After spending $40, the remaining amount of money is:

\[
70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[
\frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures}
\]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[
8 \text{ wooden action figures} + 15 \text{ plastic action figures} = 23 \text{ action figures}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
3. Calculate the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

First, let's find out how many roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week:
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses.

So, the total number of roses supplied per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many roses Ford grows in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total number of roses Ford grows in a month is:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply to the flower shops in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses} \]

Finally, we find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month:

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps to find the final value are as follows:

1. Calculate half of the starting value: \(\frac{x}{2}\).
2. Add this value to the starting value: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
3. Divide the result by 5: \(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\).
4. Subtract 12 from the starting value: \( x - 12 \).
5. Multiply the result from step 3 by the result from step 4: \(\left(\frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5}\right) \times (x - 12)\).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into these steps:

1. Half of 20 is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
2. Adding this to 20 gives \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
3. Dividing 30 by 5 gives \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).
4. Subtracting 12 from 20 gives \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
5. Multiplying 6 by 8 gives \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The actual temperature is 468 degrees when Maggie sets it to 450 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to when the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature, when increased by 4%, equals 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set. Then:

\[ x + 0.04x = 520 \]
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

1. The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

2. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - 2 hours = 2 × 60 minutes = 120 minutes
   - Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

3. Adding the durations of both movies:
   - 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating how much less it is compared to Herb's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we first find 30% of the price of Herb's house.

The price of Herb's house is $76,000. Therefore, 30% of $76,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

This means Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. So, the price of Juan's house is:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we need to find the combined value of both houses. We add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

Thus, the value of the two houses combined is:
\[ \boxed{129200} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Judy bought a dozen cups. Since a dozen is 12, Judy bought 12 cups.
2. Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.
3. Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend:

- Total cups brought: \(12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52\)
- Total dishes brought: \(24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 44 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 68\)

Adding the total number of cups and dishes together gives us the total number of utensils:

\[52 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:

- Saturday: Twice as long as Jill, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Sunday: Three times as long as Jill, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Total hours for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Next, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill.

**Jill's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}\)

**John's Earnings:**
- Rate: $10 per hour
- Total earnings: \(7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars}\)

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

**Difference in Earnings:**

"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

- Aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)

Adding these together gives the total calories burned:
\[1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\]

Next, we use the given ratio of water consumption: 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. To find out how much water Hannah needs, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{ ml}}{1600 \text{ calories}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{100 \text{ ml} \times 1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{160000 \text{ ml} \cdot \text{calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. So, we can write the equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
3B = 4500
\]
Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 1500
\]
Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans. The number of red jelly beans is:
\[
0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]
The number of green jelly beans is:
\[
1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[
1515 - 1485 = 30
\]
Thus, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"First, let's identify the three measurements of Jared's typing speed:
1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we find the sum of the measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide the sum by the number of measurements (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

So, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- Total cost on eBay: $21
- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk each day until it exceeds 20 feet. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles in height every day.

Let's calculate the height day by day:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles to \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet.

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet of the window. Therefore, it takes 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than the window.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the protein content per 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - We know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content for a week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week}
     \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"Let's denote Jerry's current age by \( x \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x = 2(x - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Expand the right side of the equation:
\[ x = 2x - 10 \]
2. Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate the variable:
\[ 0 = x - 10 \]
3. Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. **Cost of 2 implants:**
   - Each implant costs $2000.
   - Total cost for 2 implants: \( 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the porcelain crown:**
   - The additional cost for the porcelain crown is $500.
   - Total cost for the porcelain crown: \( 500 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost of dental work:**
   - Total cost for 2 implants + Cost of the porcelain crown: \( 4000 + 500 = 4500 \) dollars.

4. **Amount already paid:**
   - George has already paid a deposit of $600.
   - Remaining amount to be paid: \( 4500 - 600 = 3900 \) dollars.

5. **Hourly wage and required hours:**
   - George earns $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: \( \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \) hours.

Therefore, George needs to work \(\boxed{260}\) hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has in each type of coin:

- Quarters: 8 quarters × $0.25 = $2.00
- Dimes: 6 dimes × $0.10 = $0.60
- Nickels: 14 nickels × $0.05 = $0.70
- Pennies: 15 pennies × $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:

$2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel ($0.05), we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:

$3.45 ÷ $0.05 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then sum them up.

1. **Dogs**: Each dog has 4 legs. There are 5 dogs.
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats**: Each cat has 4 legs. There are 2 cats.
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}

"First, we need to determine the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. The speed \( S \) of the plane can be calculated using the formula:

\[ S = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional \(\boxed{5}\) hours to travel 2000 miles."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \text{Pounds Ruiz makes per hour} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds as Ruiz in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds Marissa makes per hour} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we find out how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz and Marissa can make together in one hour:

\[ \text{Pounds together per hour} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Since they worked for 12 hours in a day, we calculate the total amount of chocolates they made together in 12 hours:

\[ \text{Total pounds in 12 hours} = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   We sum up the amounts spent over the three days.
   \[
   8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Money Left:**
   Subtract the total spending from the original amount of $100.
   \[
   100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Howard has left is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the first four hours are:
  \[
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$7.50/\text{hour}
  \]
- Over four hours, his total earnings are:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times \$7.50/\text{hour} = \$30.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- Therefore, the earnings per hour for the next two hours are:
  \[
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$6.00/\text{hour}
  \]
- Over two hours, his total earnings are:
  \[
  2 \text{ hours} \times \$6.00/\text{hour} = \$12.00
  \]

Finally, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
\[
\$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{42}

Therefore, the tires will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{3}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, the number of washings per pump is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings. Therefore, the cost per washing is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump provides 60 washings, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, the cost per pump in cents is:
     \[

     \]

Thus, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy. The shirt originally costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. The discount amount for the shirt is:

\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the discounted price of the shirt is:

\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35 and there is no discount on them, so the price of the shorts remains $35. Now, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the items:

\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the items is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:

\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

Since Joe cannot have a negative amount of money in this context, the correct interpretation is that he does not have enough money to make the purchase. However, if we strictly follow the question's requirement to provide a numerical answer, the final amount left is:

\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

Next, calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95060 \]

Now, find the difference in cost between repaving Lewis' street and Monica's street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = \$95060 - \$29100 = \$65960 \]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is \$65960 more than the cost to repave Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Research Duration:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Therefore, the research lasts for 50 months in total.

3. **Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month increases by 50% each month.
   - Let's denote the initial funding for the first 5 months as \( F_0 = 100,000 \).

4. **Calculating the Funding for Each of the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The funding for the 6th month is:
     \[
     F_1 = F_0 \times 1.5 = 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000
     \]
   - The funding for the 7th month is:
     \[
     F_2 = F_1 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \times 1.5 = 225,000
     \]
   - This pattern continues, with each month's funding being 1.5 times the previous month's funding.

5. **Summing the Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The funding for the \( n \)-th month (where \( n \geq 6 \)) is:
     \[
     F_n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-5}
     \]
   - We need to sum this from \( n = 6 \) to \( n = 50 \):
     \[
     \text{Total cost for remaining 45 months} = \sum_{n=6}^{50} 100,000 \times (1.5)^{n-5}
     \]
   - This is a geometric series with the first term \( a = 150,000 \) and common ratio \( r = 1.5 \), and the number of terms \( N = 45 \).

6. **Sum of the Geometric Series:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( N \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
     \[
     S = a \frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     S = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1} = 150,000 \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{0.5} = 300,000 \left( (1.5)^{45} - 1 \right)
     \]

7. **Calculating \( (1.5)^{45} \):**
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     (1.5)^{45} \approx 1,162,261.467
     \]

8. **Final Sum:**
   - Substituting back:
     \[
     S \approx 300,000 \left( 1,162,261.467 - 1 \right) = 300,000 \times 1,162,260.467 \approx 348,678,140.10
     \]

9. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the initial 5 months' cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 348,678,140.10 \approx 348,679,140.10
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is approximately \(\boxed{348,679,140.10}\)."
"To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce in size. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the amounts of meat consumed by the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\) ounces."

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it grew to \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches, so it became \(6 + 4 = 10\) inches tall.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the total amount of meat he sells in a day is:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the 750 kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

This means 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. To find out how many seats were left after the administrators took their seats, we subtract the number of occupied seats by the administrators from the total number of seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many seats were left for the students. We subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:

   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:

"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

\[ \text{Adam's height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet. To find out how much more Adam needs to grow, we subtract his current height from the required height:

\[ \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the height he needs to grow into inches:

\[ \text{Height needed in inches} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches, given that he grows 2 inches per year:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, the number of years until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster is:

   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   For 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the total profit.
   \[
   \text{James's commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

"First, let's determine the price of the gold jewel. Given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel, and the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

Using the same formula for distance:
\[
\text{Distance Stanley biked} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances biked by Alisa and Stanley:
\[
\text{Total distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay as he does through soil, so his rate through clay is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Finally, we sum the times for digging through the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

Therefore, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes.
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**: She received 20000 more new likes recently.
   \[
   \text{Total likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{Additional likes} = 140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is:
\[
\boxed{160000}

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.
2. Calculate the total earnings for the first month.
3. Calculate the earnings for the second month.
4. Find the total earnings for both months.

First, we know that the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, and this amount is half of the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the earnings from green hats in the first month are:
\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total earnings for the first month are:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we need to calculate the earnings for the second month. The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the earnings for the second month are:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, we can find the total earnings for both months by adding the earnings from the first month and the second month:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is:

"To determine how many dollars were withheld from Sally's wage, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week.
2. Identify the final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week.
3. Determine the amount of money that was added to her account during the week.
4. Calculate the difference between her expected wage and the amount added to her account.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The initial amount in Sally's bank account at the start of the week is $200.
2. The final amount in Sally's bank account at the end of the week is $420.
3. The amount of money that was added to her account during the week is the final amount minus the initial amount:
   \[
   420 - 200 = 220
   \]
4. Sally's expected weekly wage is $300. The amount of money that was withheld from her wage is the expected wage minus the amount added to her account:
   \[
   300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money withheld from Sally's wage is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   \[
   3 \text{ halves/guest} \times 16 \text{ guests} = 48 \text{ halves}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}

   \text{Initial cost} = \$150,000
   \]

2. **Monthly Hanger Rental Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly hanger rental} = \$5,000
   \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Monthly fuel cost} = 2 \times \text{Monthly hanger rental} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Maintenance Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly maintenance} = \text{Monthly hanger rental} + \text{Monthly fuel cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000

   \[
   \text{Time for rice} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Cooking time for pork:**
   \[
   \text{Time for pork} = \text{Time for rice} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Cooking time for beans:**
   \[
   \text{Time for beans} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Time for pork} + \text{Time for rice}) = \frac{1}{2} \times (50 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes}) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Total cooking time:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for rice} + \text{Time for pork} + \text{Time for beans} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs \(\boxed{3}\) dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20.
4. The total number of animal legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on the information:
1. The total number of heads equation: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs equation: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15.

To find the number of geese \( G \), we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 20 - 15 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The original brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more.

"First, we need to determine the number of history teachers on the basketball court. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the amounts of money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much each person would have if they shared the total money equally, we divide the total money by 3:

\[
\text{Money per person} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, if they decided to add together their money and share it equally, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Good Days**: Christina had 12 good days in the first 30 days.
2. **First 8 Days**: The first 8 days were all good, so she had 8 good days in the first 8 days.
3. **Second 8 Days**: The next 8 days were bad, so no good days were added here.
4. **Third 8 Days**: The following 8 days were neutral, so no good days were added here.
5. **Next 3 Days**: The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. This adds 2 more good days (since the first and third days were good).

Now, let's calculate the total number of good days:
- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the next 3 days: 2

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \]

So, the total number of good days in the month is 10. Since she initially had 12 good days, and now we have 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the total number of toys James needs.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - When he returns, there are twice as many dogs as before, so the number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

3. **After Buying More Toys:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - When he returns again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he still has enough toys for 21 dogs.

4. **Total Number of Toys Needed:**
   - Initially, James needed 12 toys.
   - Then he needed to buy 12 more toys.
   - He did not need to buy any more toys after that because he had enough for the 21 dogs.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[
1200 - 480 = 720
\]

Next, Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining $720.

\[
\text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
\]

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount in the account is:

\[
720 - 480 = 240
\]

This remaining amount of $240 is Skyler's investment.

\[
\text{Skyler's investment} = 240
\]

Thus, the amount of money Skyler invested is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have together.
2. Subtract this total from their goal to find out how many more signatures they need.

First, let's find the total number of signatures they currently have:
- Carol has 20 signatures.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures.
- Together, they have \(20 + 44 = 64\) signatures.

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach 100:
- Their goal is 100 signatures.
- They currently have 64 signatures.
- Therefore, they need \(100 - 64 = 36\) more signatures.

So, the sisters need to collect \(\boxed{36}\) more signatures to reach their goal."
"First, let's determine how much Karen earns per hour. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours per day, then in two days she works:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate Karen's earnings for these 6 hours. Since she earns $20 per hour, her total earnings for 6 hours are:

\[ 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[

\]"
"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start by finding out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can calculate the number of hash browns per potato as follows:

\[
\text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

Next, we use this ratio to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[
\text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}
\]"
"First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults and Jack.

Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 8 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Including Jack, the total number of people is 9. Since Jack is also an adult, his weight is also 80 kg. Adding Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults gives:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by:
\[ \boxed{20} \, \text{kg} \]"
"Let's start by defining the number of cookies each person has in terms of variables and given information.

1. Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
2. Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \). Substituting \( K = 68 \) into this equation, we get \( 68 = M - 5 \). Solving for \( M \), we get \( M = 68 + 5 = 73 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \). Substituting \( M = 73 \) into this equation, we get \( 73 = C + 12 \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = 73 - 12 = 61 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \). Substituting \( M = 73 \) into this equation, we get \( S = 73 + 23 = 96 \).

Now, we need to find the total number of cookies they have. We add the number of cookies each person has:
\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by mowing half in ""turtle"" mode and half in ""rabbit"" mode, we need to calculate the time taken for each half separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
- It takes 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) minutes to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode.

Next, let's find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
- It takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.
- Therefore, it takes \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode.

Now, we add the times for both halves:
- Time for half in ""turtle"" mode: 30 minutes
- Time for half in ""rabbit"" mode: 20 minutes

Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Thus, it took Chris \(\boxed{50}\) minutes to mow the lawn."

"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The price per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times 4 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The price per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 2 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The price per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilo} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum the costs of apples, bananas, and oranges:
     \[
     4 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Catherine pays is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cookies baked by Celinda} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we find the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

After baking, the pair eats 10 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies left to be put in the box is:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

So, the number of cookies in the box is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( y \) and \( x \):
\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

We need to find the value of \( y \). To do this, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) are ages, they must be positive integers. We need to find a value of \( x \) that makes \( y \) a positive integer. Let's test some values for \( x \):

If \( x = 9 \):
\[ y = 37 - 3 \cdot 9 = 37 - 27 = 10 \]

So, if the younger triplet is 9 years old, then the older triplet is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) years old, and the twins are each 10 years old. Let's check the combined ages:
\[ 10 + 16 + 9 + 9 = 44 \]

The combined ages match the given information. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time John will spend on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. Adding these times together, we get:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the number of minutes John has to nap is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[
\frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 candies:
\[
10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

We also know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[
10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[
4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

And the total number of coins Neil has saved:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of coins they have saved together:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of one banana. We know that one apple costs $0.50 and one banana costs twice as much as one apple. Therefore, the cost of one banana is:
\[ 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange. We know that one orange costs three times as much as one banana. Therefore, the cost of one orange is:
\[ 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas in the crate. There are 5 bananas in the crate, and each banana costs $1.00. Therefore, the total cost of the bananas is:
\[ 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the apples in the crate. There are 12 apples in the crate, and each apple costs $0.50. Therefore, the total cost of the apples is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the oranges in the crate. There are 7 oranges in the crate, and each orange costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost of the oranges is:
\[ 7 \times 3.00 = 21.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges to find the total cost of the crate:
\[ 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is:
\[ \boxed{32.00} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of each type of square in Brittany's quilted comforter.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = 14 (red squares) + 4 = 18 blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Number of green squares = 18 (blue squares) + 6 = 24 green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Number of white squares = 24 (green squares) - 12 = 12 white squares.

Next, we sum the total number of squares to find the total area of the comforter:
- Total number of squares = 14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is equal to the total number of squares.

Therefore, the total area of Brittany's comforter is:
\[

"First, let's determine the number of regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. According to the problem, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of chairs currently available in the restaurant:

\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs needed for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs required is:

\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:

\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia has to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
   \]
4. **Betty's Points (Recheck)**: We already calculated Betty's points as 65, so this is consistent.
5. **Marta's Points**: Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, we calculate:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:
\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we find:

\[ 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract 8800 from 11600:

\[ \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of dumplings each female ate.
2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate.
3. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females.
4. Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males.
5. Sum the dumplings eaten by the females and the males to get the total number of dumplings cooked.

Given:
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.
- There are 6 females and 8 males (including Larry).

First, calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:
\[ 6 \text{ females} \times 3 \text{ dumplings per female} = 18 \text{ dumplings} \]

So, Julia received $40.

Next, we need to find out how much money Gerald has left after spending $10 on a book. Gerald initially had $60, and he spent $10:
\[
60 - 10 = 50
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Gerald has left is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"First, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle. We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and that the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second. Therefore, the speed of the turtle is:

\[
\text{Speed of the turtle} = \frac{\text{Speed of the cat}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we need to calculate how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. Since the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, the distance it can crawl in 40 seconds is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"To determine how many additional hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to calculate how much more money they need to raise. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount needed is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. From the information given, in the first 3 hours, they raised $2100. So, the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200. Since they raise $700 per hour, the number of additional hours required is:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Therefore, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes is:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of the river's water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of the river's water used by the city is 40%.
   - The percentage used for industrial purposes is 32%.
   - Therefore, the percentage used for non-industrial purposes is:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is:
  \[
  \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream:
  \[
  50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
  \]
- For vanilla ice cream:
  \[
  12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
\[
2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Thus, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[
\boxed{3000}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

1. **Croissants:**
   \[
   5 \text{ croissants} \times \$3.00 \text{ per croissant} = \$15.00
   \]

2. **Cinnamon Rolls:**
   \[
   4 \text{ cinnamon rolls} \times \$2.50 \text{ per cinnamon roll} = \$10.00
   \]

3. **Mini Quiches:**
   \[
   3 \text{ mini quiches} \times \$4.00 \text{ per mini quiche} = \$12.00
   \]

4. **Blueberry Muffins:**
   \[
   13 \text{ blueberry muffins} \times \$1.00 \text{ per blueberry muffin} = \$13.00
   \]

Next, we sum up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"First, let's determine the cost of the deal. For every 2 scoops Erin buys, she gets 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50, so the cost for 2 scoops is:

\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00 Erin spends, she gets 3 scoops of ice cream (2 bought + 1 free).

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can get with $6.00, we divide $6.00 by the cost of the deal ($3.00):

\[ 6.00 \div 3.00 = 2 \]

This means Erin can get 2 sets of the deal, which equals:

\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 2 scoops to get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks.

Two weeks consist of 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in 14 days, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the amount of candy each has left is:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Ginger} \]
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \text{ for Amy} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after two weeks, Amy has \(\boxed{14}\) more pieces of candy than Ginger."

"To determine the total number of taps Helga makes, we need to calculate the taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the taps per minute for each foot:
- When her arms are down, her right foot taps at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute.
- When her arms are raised, her right foot taps at 200 taps per minute and her left foot at 200 taps per minute.

Next, we need to determine the total time for each condition:
- Helga dances with her arms down for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.
- Helga dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Now, we calculate the total taps for each condition:
1. **With arms down:**
   - Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

"First, let's determine the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas is:

\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three people ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Since three people ate 8 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends. Each of these two people ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Since two people ate 9 slices each, the total number of slices eaten by the remaining two friends is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:

\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

The total number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's determine the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages, and the dog can do this in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the cat's time.

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time for the cat} + \text{Time for the dog}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- Each students' car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The number of students' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
16 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teachers' car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \text{ cars}
\]

The total number of windows smashed for these cars is:
\[
24 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars:

\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their individual ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"First, let's break down the weights of each book:

- Cindy's math and science books each weigh 2 pounds. Since there are two books, the total weight for these is:
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- Her French book weighs 4 pounds.

- Her English book weighs 3 pounds.

- Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since her English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
  \[
  2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:

\[
4 \text{ pounds (math and science)} + 4 \text{ pounds (French)} + 3 \text{ pounds (English)} + 6 \text{ pounds (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"First, let's determine how many votes candidate A received. Since candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we calculate:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we first find 50% of candidate A's votes and then add that to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{50% of candidate A's votes} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many votes candidate C received by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine how many apples Beck initially has. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, we calculate Beck's apples as follows:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube:

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \( 8 \times 0.5 = 4 \) ounces.

Next, we sum the total water used for all the ice cubes:
\[ 12 \text{ ounces (giant cubes)} + 14 \text{ ounces (medium cubes)} + 4 \text{ ounces (small cubes)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's determine how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of books Steven has} = \frac{\text{Number of books Clara has}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, we need to find out how many books Alice has. Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Therefore, we can calculate the number of books Alice has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of books Alice has} = \text{Number of books Steven has} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice. We know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books. The difference is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of books Clara has} - \text{Number of books Alice has} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has \(\boxed{4}\) more books than Alice."
"First, let's determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $5, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in both classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls. Therefore, we calculate 40% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the number of boys is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes at $0.50 each and now buys them at $0.40 each. The difference in price per tomato is:
\[ 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato} \]

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings. There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are:
\[ 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Cal has:

\[ \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Carl has. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} \]
\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:

\[ \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} \]

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. This is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since each group should have the same number of students, we use the number of students per group from the first calculation:

\[ \text{Total students needed for 12 groups} = 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Since we only have 54 students, we need to find out how many more students are required to form 12 groups:

\[ \text{Additional students needed} = 108 - 54 = 54 \]

However, the question asks how many more groups are needed, not how many more students. Since we already have 6 groups and need a total of 12 groups, the number of additional groups required is:

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6 \]

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single week:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- During weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.

So, the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one week is:
\[ 60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ chairs} \]

And the number of chairs rented during weekends in one week is:
\[ 100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs rented in one week is:
\[ 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are rented in two 4-week months. Since there are 8 weeks in two 4-week months, we multiply the weekly total by 8:
\[ 500 \text{ chairs/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 4000 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half of the bananas:**
   Arnold steals half of the 48 bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, after Arnold steals, Gunther has:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 bananas to his pile.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Arnold steals 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 bananas from the 49 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas to his pile.

"First, let's calculate the monthly share for each roommate:

Total monthly electricity bill = $100
Number of roommates = 4

Monthly share per roommate = Total monthly electricity bill / Number of roommates
Monthly share per roommate = $100 / 4
Monthly share per roommate = $25

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate:

Number of months in a year = 12

Annual share per roommate = Monthly share per roommate * Number of months in a year
Annual share per roommate = $25 * 12
Annual share per roommate = $300

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"First, let's determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff initially sent:

- **Glasses**: 8 dozen glasses
  \[
  8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates**: 4 dozen plates
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

Next, we account for the items that were broken:

- **Broken glasses**: 10 glasses
- **Broken plates**: 6 plates

Now, we subtract the broken items from the initial amounts:

- **Remaining glasses**:
  \[
  96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates**:
  \[
  48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small buttons = \(\frac{27}{3} = 9\) large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(40 + 9 = 49\) large buttons and \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 49 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 49 = 24.5\). Since the number of stickers must be an integer, we assume she trades 24 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so 24 large stickers = 24 large buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has \(49 - 24 = 25\) large buttons and 3 small stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 25 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 25 large stickers = \(25 \times 3 = 75\) small buttons.
   - After trading, Lorraine has 75 small buttons and 3 small stickers.

5. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 75 small buttons and 0 large buttons (since all large buttons were converted to small buttons).
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \(75 + 0 = 75\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we need to add up the matches he played on each day.

1. On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
2. On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
3. On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, on Saturday he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Now, we sum the matches from each day:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given as 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into this expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.
   - \( \text{XS} = 11 \)

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - \( \text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \)

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - \( \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \)

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - \( \text{L} = \frac{\text{M}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - \( \text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 \)

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed:
\[
\text{Total Shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
11 + 22 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 18 = 51

"First, let's determine how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. This leaves:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

people who do not think horse #2 will win. Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \]

This means 24 people think horse #7 will win. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people who do not think horse #2 will win:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \]

So, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of Pomeranian girls:**
   We know there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

2. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \text{ of Pomeranians} = 6
   \]
   To find the total number of Pomeranians, we multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   \text{Total Pomeranians} = 6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let \( P \) be the total number of puppies. Then:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \text{ of } P = 18
   \]
   To find \( P \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's determine how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava has $90 and she gave Jayden half of it. Therefore, the amount given by Ava is:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

Next, we add the money Jayden originally had to the money given by Ava:

\[
70 + 45 = 115
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera, which costs $200. We subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera:

\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

Therefore, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x \]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles for the third house, which is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the number of cases of shingles the third house will need is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1000}{7}} \]"

Next, we sum the individual costs to find the total amount spent by all three:

\[
\$6 \text{ (Leila)} + \$5 \text{ (Jack)} + \$3 \text{ (Chase)} = \$14
\]

Thus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase to make the salad for the potluck is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

1. Calculate 45% of the number of bananas:
\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

2. Add this amount to the number of bananas to find the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

So, George has 290 pears.

Next, we need to find the total number of fruits George has by adding the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 \text{ (bananas)} + 290 \text{ (pears)} = 490 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is:

"First, let's determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour. According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can set up the following equation to find out how many books Ahmed read:

\[ \text{Number of books Ahmed read} = \frac{\text{Number of books Ezra read}}{2} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to account for the additional books Ezra decided to read. Ezra read 150 more books, so the total number of books Ezra has read is:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Now, we add the number of books Ahmed read to the total number of books Ezra has read to find the total number of books they have read altogether:

\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they have read altogether is:

\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To determine how much Tanya earned over the two days, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday.**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours on Monday.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 for the day.

First, calculate her hourly earnings:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75 \]

Next, add the additional $5 for teaching more than 3 classes:
\[ \$75 + \$5 = \$80 \]

So, Tanya earns $80 on Monday.

**Step 2: Calculate Tanya's earnings for Wednesday.**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours on Wednesday.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- Since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

First, calculate her hourly earnings:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

So, Tanya earns $30 on Wednesday.

**Step 3: Sum the earnings from both days.**
\[ \$80 + \$30 = \$110 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{110}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Now, we find the difference in the number of scents sold:
- Difference = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
- Difference = \(20 - 16 = 4\).

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

Final answer:
4"
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make an additional $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount needed by the number of ears of corn:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has available over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know that she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can determine how much time she spends playing soccer by subtracting the time spent on reading and video games from the remaining time:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the total weekend time (12 hours) and the time spent playing soccer (3 hours):

\[ \left( \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately, and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove for a certain amount of time at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Let \( t_d \) be the time spent driving in hours.
- The total time spent traveling (driving and hiking) is 6 hours, and they spent 1.5 hours hiking.
- Therefore, the time spent driving is \( t_d = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \) hours.
- The distance driven is given by the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
- So, the distance driven is \( 50 \times 4.5 = 225 \) miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- The average hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
- Half the driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
- The time spent hiking is 1.5 hours.
- The distance hiked is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ 225 + 30 = 255 \]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

Let:
- \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer for Emma.
- \( A_t \) be the seconds left on the timer for Ava.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from the timer: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the relationships between the variables:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we can find the difference between their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Calculate the number of rides on the 5 usual days:**
   - They ride their bikes 3 times a day on these 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 5 days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days:**

   - Therefore, the total number of rides on these 2 days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rides in a week:**
   - Add the rides from the usual days and the special days:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}

Thus, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 \]

\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

Carrie was given:
- Ten twenties, which is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- Fourteen quarters, which is \(14 \times 0.25 = 3.50\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money she received is:
\[200 + 3.50 = 203.50 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, we need to determine how much money Carrie spent. She spent all the quarters and \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties.

The amount spent on quarters is:
\[14 \times 0.25 = 3.50 \text{ dollars}\]

The amount spent on twenties is:
\[\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars}\]

So, the total amount of money she spent is:

- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to calculate the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

1. Calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

2. Calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
   \]

3. Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money needed for the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Calculate how much John still needs to raise after the school's contribution.

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[
\text{School's contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise after the school's contribution. John has $50, so we subtract the school's contribution and John's current amount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Amount John needs to raise} = 300 - 150 - 50 = 100
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"First, we need to determine the temperature during the night. If it is 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, the temperature needs to be raised from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many groups of 9 people can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing 90 by 9:

\[
\frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. Therefore, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 10:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
\]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups that brought seashells by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[
6 \times 2 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"

"First, let's determine Jamie's regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate for additional hours.

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.

The special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
\[ 150\% \times 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much Jamie was paid for the 11 hours she worked on Tuesday. Since she worked 8 hours at her regular rate and 3 hours at the special rate, we can break it down as follows:

1. Calculate the pay for the first 8 hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars per hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

2. Calculate the pay for the additional 3 hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars per hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Add the two amounts together to find the total pay for the 11 hours:

"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of female lions.
2. Calculate the number of male lions.
3. Identify the number of lion cubs.
4. Sum the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of female lions is 12.
- The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, which is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \).
- The number of lion cubs is 14.

Now, we add these numbers together:
\[ 12 \text{ (female lions)} + 6 \text{ (male lions)} + 14 \text{ (lion cubs)} = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the discount on the jeans. The original price of the jeans is $40, and they are advertised at 25% off.

To find the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he will have left over, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.
4. Determine the total salary paid over three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 \text{ employees} + 60 \text{ employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for 260 employees is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine the total salary paid over three months.**

The total salary paid over three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"To determine the total time Carrie's choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the time for each song and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \( 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \).

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once.
- Therefore, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is \( 240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds} \).

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the overall caroling time:
- Total time = \( 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \).

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is \(\boxed{540}\) seconds."
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:**
   \[
   \text{Starting wage} = \$10 \text{ per hour}
   \]

2. **After 2 months, Billy's wage is increased by $0.50:**
   \[
   \text{Wage after 2 months} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's wage is increased by $1.00:**
   \[
   \text{Wage on first anniversary} = \$10.50 + \$1.00 = \$11.50 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Next, we calculate Sally's starting hourly wage, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage:
\[
\text{Sally's starting wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Billy and Sally over 20 hours of work:

1. **Billy's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Billy's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230
   \]

2. **Sally's earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Sally's earnings} = 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210
   \]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
\text{Difference} = \$230 - \$210 = \$20

To find half of Pierson's points:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's points:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we need to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita combined:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
\[ \boxed{428} \]"
"To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- Each class has 25 students.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of students is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \).
- Since each student plants one tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is \( 1000 \).

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- There are 40 classes.
- Therefore, the total number of teachers is \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \).
- Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

Now, we sum the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers:

"First, let's determine the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Adding these together gives:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
\[ 14 + x \]

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Divide both sides by 0.70:
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy \(\boxed{6}\) stuffed goats."
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks (14 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the first 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part of her schedule. She plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week (7 days).

\[ \text{Hours played in the second week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts of her schedule to find the total hours she has played so far.

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours.

\[ \text{Hours still needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the separation between the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Separation = Distance traveled by the second car - Distance traveled by the first car
   \[
   \text{Separation} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Thus, the number of miles that will separate the two cars after 2 hours is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the materials before the premium is added. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, James pays a 30% premium on this total cost. To find the amount of the premium, we calculate 30% of $900:

\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the original total cost to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

First, let's determine the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third Graders:**
   - Number of third-graders: 500
   - Number of third-graders who passed: 340

2. **Fourth Graders:**
   - Number of fourth-graders: 100
   - Number of fourth-graders who passed: 40

3. **Fifth Graders:**
   - Number of fifth-graders: 400
   - Pass rate for fifth graders: Twice the fourth graders' pass rate
   - Fourth graders' pass rate: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \)
   - Fifth graders' pass rate: \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \)
   - Number of fifth-graders who passed: \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \)

Next, we calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total number of students who passed:
  \[
  340 \text{ (third-graders)} + 40 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 320 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 680
  \]

- Total number of students:
  \[
  500 \text{ (third-graders)} + 100 \text{ (fourth-graders)} + 400 \text{ (fifth-graders)} = 1000
  \]

Now, we find the overall pass rate by dividing the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{680}{1000} = 0.68

"First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. Therefore, the total number of branches he climbed is calculated by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Thus, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Thus, each kid can have \(\boxed{7}\) S'mores."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the duration each person can play:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so each of them can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

2. **Calculate the total time each person can play in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equivalent to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil in ounces.
- According to the problem, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
- The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the quantities in terms of \( z \):
- \( s = 2z \)
- \( o = 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \)

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of the amounts of all the ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ o + s + z + z + s = 10 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ 4z + 2z + z + z + 2z = 10 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 10z = 10 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ o = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{4}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, and then add these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(\boxed{4500}\)."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we add the cupcakes he already has and subtract this total from 63.

First, we calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has:
\[ 8 \text{ (chocolate)} + 40 \text{ (toffee)} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Next, we determine how many more cupcakes he needs to buy by subtracting the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number needed:
\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy \(\boxed{15}\) more cupcakes."
"First, let's determine how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they collectively raised $125,000. So, the amount raised by each student is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the time Sandy walked on the first day in hours.
2. Calculate the time Sandy walked on the second day in hours.
3. Convert the total walking time from hours to minutes.

First, we know that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.

Next, we calculate the time she walked on the second day. Since she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day, we have:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the total time she walked over the two days in hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert the total time from hours to minutes, we use the fact that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes:
\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count**: Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. **First Break Count**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Lunch Break Count**: During the lunch break, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]
   Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is \(\boxed{35}\)."

So, Kimberly bought \(\boxed{52}\) more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Next, we isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Then, we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards. Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy had in total.

1. **Green Eggs:**
   Cindy had 5 green eggs.

2. **Blue Eggs:**
   Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green ones. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Pink Eggs:**
   Cindy had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9
   \]

4. **Yellow Eggs:**
   Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
\[
5 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (blue)} + 9 \text{ (pink)} + 3 \text{ (yellow)} = 27
\]

So, the total number of eggs Cindy had is:
\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, given their speed relative to that of the kangaroos.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, the time it takes for one kangaroo to travel the same distance is also 18 hours, since they are all traveling at the same speed.

Next, we need to determine the speed of the turtles. The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to travel the distance, a turtle, traveling at half the speed, will take twice as long to travel the same distance. 

So, the time it takes for one turtle to travel the distance is:
\[ 18 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Since the turtles are traveling at the same speed and there are four turtles, the time it takes for all four turtles to travel the distance is still 36 hours, because they are all traveling at the same speed and covering the same distance simultaneously.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we start by defining the number of dishes each person makes based on the information given.

1. **Kora's Dishes:**

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her job, and the money from her mom, is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + 280 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 280 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 280 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, since each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of apple slices Adam has is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

"First, calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces daily with 3 cows:

\[ 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} \times 3 \text{ cows} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed to produce the extra 10 liters is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 2 \]"

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \(\boxed{20}\) millimeters."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

- Cost of the car: $10000
- Cost of the phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has:

- Money from working on weekends: $5000
- Money from his brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, let's find out how much more money Gabriel needs:

Money needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"To determine how much change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.
2. Subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman. She gave four $20 bills, so we multiply 4 by 20:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount of money given. The hat cost $70, so we subtract 70 from 80:
\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had to find out how much money he has left:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. Therefore, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Therefore, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)
- Peter's total: \( 60 \) socks + \( 30 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students who are good at math is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group takes to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest scheme, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the principal amount (P), the annual interest rate (r), and the time period (t).
2. Use the simple interest formula to calculate the interest earned over the 3 years.
3. Add the interest to the principal to find the total amount after 3 years.

The principal amount (P) is $300. The annual interest rate (r) is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year. However, since the interest rate is given as a fraction of the original amount, we need to express it as a decimal. The annual interest rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{300}{300} = 0.75 \) or 75%.

The time period (t) is 3 years. The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 = 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of shirts with specific characteristics and then compare the quantities.

1. **Calculate the number of white shirts with collars:**
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of the white shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Calculate the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Number of floral shirts with buttons: 20
   - Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Determine the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars:**
   - Number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts with no collars: 20
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer will use to hold all 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.5 \text{ per tray} = \$75 \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, we add the number of goats left in both farms to find the total number of goats left:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair of shoes, we divide the total annual expenditure by the total number of pairs of shoes:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is:
     \[
     3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food.
   - Therefore, the cost per basket of red food after the discount is:
     \[
     18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total cost for 3 baskets of red food is:
     \[
     3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Add the total cost of the green food and the red food:
     \[
     75 + 48 = 123 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"First, we need to determine how many rooms constitute one-half of the total rooms at KozyInn Motel. Given that there are 90 rooms in total:

\[
\text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
\]

Next, we know that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Therefore, to find the total time required to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:

\[
\text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   - The town will build 12 homes.

2. **Second Year:**
   - They will build three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   - Number of homes in the second year = \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

3. **Third Year:**
   - They will build double the total number of homes built in the first two years.
   - Total homes built in the first two years = \( 12 + 36 = 48 \).
   - Number of homes in the third year = \( 2 \times 48 = 96 \).

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   - Sum of homes built in each year = \( 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \).

The town will have built a total of 144 homes over the next three years."
"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned in the problem:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mother.
- Let \( A \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( A = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( A = S + 2 \).
3. Your mother's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( A + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( A = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( A = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the equation for \( M \):
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

We now have all the ages in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 3 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]
\[ M = 3B - 1 \]

Substitute these into the sum of their ages:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( A \):
\[ A = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to determine the total number of glue sticks required for Mr. Jackson's class. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we calculate:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find the number of packs required, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks. To confirm, 6 packs would only provide:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 48 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is not enough since 48 is less than 54. Therefore, 7 packs will provide:

\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks/pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This is more than enough, and it ensures that there are extra glue sticks left over. Thus, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the changes in the amount of water passing through the river step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"To determine how many people are infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

1. **Day 0 (Initial Infection):**
   - Initially, 10 people are infected.

2. **Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 1: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
   - Total infected after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

3. **Day 2:**
   - Now, 70 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 2: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
   - Total infected after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

4. **Day 3:**
   - Now, 490 people are infected, and each infects 6 others.
   - New infections on Day 3: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
   - Total infected after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the total number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much 10% of Rafaela's tips is, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Therefore, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of tips received by Julieta and Rafaela altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges.

- She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.
- She gave 3 oranges to her son.

So, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\) oranges.

Therefore, the number of oranges Jennifer remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

"First, let's determine how many badges each girl earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. Therefore, in a year (which has 12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns \(\boxed{30}\) more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's determine how many hours Paige spent baking. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

Next, we calculate the total number of banana bread loaves she baked. Since she can bake 2 loaves per hour, over 5 hours she baked:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, then she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

\[70 + 40 = 110\]

So, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**
   - There are 50 students.
   - Each student was given 10 burritos.
   \[
   50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed:**
   - Add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George.
   \[
   500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered.
   \[
   600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos}
   \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of red cars is 12.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, let's denote the number of yellow cars as \(Y\).

The total number of cars in the rink is the sum of red, green, blue, and yellow cars, which is given as 75. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[12 + 10 + 30 + Y = 75\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[52 + Y = 75\]

To find \(Y\), we subtract 52 from both sides of the equation:

\[Y = 75 - 52\]
\[Y = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).
3. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \).

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13. \]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ S = F + 13, \]
\[ A = F - 12. \]

Substitute these into the third equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85, \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85. \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84. \]

Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28. \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"To determine the weight of the carrots Daisy bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the bag of potatoes.
2. Calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes.
3. Determine the weight of the bag of carrots based on the weight of the sweet potatoes.

Step 1: The weight of the bag of potatoes is given as 5 pounds.

Step 2: The weight of the bag of sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the bag of potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: The weight of the bag of carrots is 3 pounds fewer than the weight of the sweet potatoes. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the weight of the carrots Daisy bought is \(\boxed{7}\) pounds."
"First, let's determine the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since one three-ounce box makes 10 cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each three-ounce box of jello is currently on sale for $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, calculate the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \text{ phones} \times \$700 \text{ per phone} = \$3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[ \$4000 - \$3500 = \$500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we calculate:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the total cost. We calculate Keenan's share as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400 and there are 4 weeks in a month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. We divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle for soda and water.

1. **Cost per bottle of soda:**
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Cost per bottle of soda = \(\frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Cost per bottle of water:**
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Cost per bottle of water = \(\frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

3. **Total cost for 3 bottles of soda:**
   - Cost per bottle of soda = $3.00.
   - Total cost for 3 bottles = \(3 \times 3.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 2 bottles of water:**
   - Cost per bottle of water = $2.00.
   - Total cost for 2 bottles = \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\) dollars.

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount David will spend.

5. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost for soda + Total cost for water = \(9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is \(\boxed{13.00}\)."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money. David starts with $12.48, so:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"First, we need to determine Ella's hourly rate for dog walking. She earned $33 for 3 hours of work. We can calculate her hourly rate by dividing the total earnings by the total hours worked:

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she would earn if she worked for 12 hours at this rate. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she will work:

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn \(\boxed{132}\) dollars after 12 hours of dog walking."

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
   \]

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens:**
   Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
   \[
   180 \text{ chickens} \times 50 \text{ dollars per chicken} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit Isaias makes:**
   Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} - \text{Cost of chickens} = \text{Profit}
   \]
   Let \( C \) be the total cost of the chickens.
   \[
   9000 - C = 2000
   \]

4. **Solve for the cost of the chickens:**
   \[
   C = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Isaias bought the chickens for is \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"First, let's determine how many glasses of lemonade Micah and Mitchell sold in total. Since Julie sold 14 glasses and the total sales were 32 glasses, the boys together sold:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \text{ glasses each} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent \(\frac{1}{4}\) as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure. She spent \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much on the pedicure as she did on the manicure, so we have:

\[
\text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
\]

Now, we sum up all the expenses to find the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Sarah will earn from selling the 20-meter rope at $2 per meter.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40 \]

Next, let's assume Sarah uses all the money from the sale to buy a new rope. The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter. To find out how much money she will have left over, we need to know the length of the new rope she plans to buy. However, the problem does not specify the length of the new rope. For the sake of this problem, let's assume she buys a new rope of the same length as the original rope, which is 20 meters.

\[ \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30 \]

Now, we can calculate the leftover money after buying the new rope.

\[ \text{Leftover money} = \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:

"First, let's determine Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:

\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \( x \) years, she will be:

\[ 8 + x \]

We set this equal to 24 and solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final answer is:

\[

"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon:**
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon.
   - Total cost for bacon: $10.

2. **Chicken:**
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Cost of one packet of chicken: \(2 \times \frac{10}{5} = 2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   - Total cost for chicken: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Strawberries:**
   - Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Total cost for strawberries: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Apples:**
   - Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Cost of one pack of apples: \(\frac{4}{2} = 2\) dollars.
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - Total cost for apples: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) dollars.

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"First, we need to determine how many microphones will not find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Given that 20% of the 50 microphones won't fit, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones will not be paired. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. Since he counted 6 birds nesting, \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
- Birds nesting in the bushes: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds feeding: 24

The total number of birds Jerry counts is:
\[6 + 4 + 24 = 34\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"First, let's calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the daisies have \(\boxed{15}\) more petals than the orchids."
"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
\]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[
\text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75
\]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[
\text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
\]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:

\[
\text{Number of flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25
\]

To find the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the speed of the whirligig, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the speed of the thingamabob.
2. Use the speed of the thingamabob to find the speed of the whirligig.

First, we know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11:

\[
\text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121 \text{ meters per second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, we can find the speed of the whirligig by multiplying the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first figure out how much she earned from mowing lawns over the two weeks.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

**First Week:**
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the total payment for the first week is $6.

**Second Week:**
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Therefore, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so the total payment for the second week is $6.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns over the two weeks:
\[
\text{Total earnings from mowing lawns} = 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tasha made a total of $80 last month, which includes her earnings from mowing lawns and lemonade sales. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[
\text{Earnings from lemonade sales} = 80 - 12 = 68 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each person read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10\) (yesterday) + \(18\) (today) = \(28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13\) (yesterday) + \(0\) (today) = \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's determine the total amount of soup Calvin has. The pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, we can use the adult's bowl measurement to understand the total amount of soup.

Calvin and his wife are both adults, so they will need 2 adult bowls of soup. Additionally, they have two children, and each child will need 1 child's bowl of soup. Therefore, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:

\[ 2 \text{ (adult bowls)} + 2 \text{ (child bowls)} = 4 \text{ bowls} \]

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and Calvin and his wife are the only adults, they will use 2 of those bowls. This leaves:

\[ 4 \text{ (total bowls)} - 2 \text{ (adult bowls used)} = 2 \text{ bowls} \]

These 2 remaining bowls are for the two children. Since each child needs 1 bowl, and there are 2 bowls left, each child will get:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 1 \text{ bowl per child} \]

Thus, each child will be able to have 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards.
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards.

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the amount of material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards.
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards.

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
- Total material needed = material for small masks + material for large masks
- Total material needed = 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Determine the total amount spent.
3. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased to find the average price per ticket.

First, we calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, the total number of times she saw the movies is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

Next, we know that the total amount spent is $216. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's break down Harold's daily activities and their durations:

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on these activities:
- Time spent sleeping: 10 hours
- Time spent working: 8 hours
- Time spent walking the dog: 1 hour

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time Harold has left, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"First, let's determine how many blue shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is \(7 - 3 = 4\).

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the final number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is 4 blue and 6 red.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles Dean had:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

So, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

14"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then find out how old he will be in 8 years.

First, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D \) is 60. So, we have:
\[ D = 60 \]

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Next, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = \frac{60}{2} \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be \(\boxed{38}\) years old in 8 years."
"First, let's determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm. According to the problem, Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

To find twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we need to find the total number of acres for both farms combined. We add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Colby earns for completing 320 packages. Since he earns $0.20 for each package, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"First, let's determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. Since a normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes per bottle:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
- There are 20 red balloons.

We can write the equation for the total pieces of bologna thrown as:
\[ 2r + 3y = 58 \]

We also know the number of red balloons:
\[ r = 20 \]

Substitute \( r = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3y = 58 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 40 + 3y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to isolate the term with \( y \):
\[ 3y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 6 \]

Thus, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first need to calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.

Jon drives 100 miles a day. Therefore, in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many tune-ups are required for 3000 miles, given that a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles. We do this by dividing the total miles driven by the interval at which tune-ups are needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Thus, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   - Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   - Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) hours.

3. **Thursday:**
   - Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Thursday is \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) hours.

Now, we sum up the hours worked over the three days:

\[
5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they had and then divide it by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons and they cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This is the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had together. Since they had the same amount of allowance and combined it, the total amount of their allowances is $28. Therefore, each girl's allowance is:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fruits Kira bought:

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \( 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \( 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

"Let's define the variables for the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as follows:
- Let \( P \) be the age of Peter.
- Let \( p \) be the age of Paul.
- Let \( j \) be the age of Jean.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( P + p + j = 100 \)
2. \( p = j + 10 \)
3. \( P = p + j \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( p \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (j + 10) + j = 2j + 10 \]

Now we have \( P \) in terms of \( j \). Next, we substitute \( p = j + 10 \) and \( P = 2j + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ (2j + 10) + (j + 10) + j = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2j + j + j + 10 + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4j + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4j = 80 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ j = 20 \]

Now that we have \( j = 20 \), we can find \( p \) and \( P \):
\[ p = j + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2j + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Balloons:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people each donate 5 boxes:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all 60 boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes.

The total number of tables needed is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.

For Zoey:
- Number of seeds: 40
- Distance per seed: 10 feet
- Total distance spat by Zoey: \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet

For Sydney:
- Number of seeds: 35
- Distance per seed: 12 feet
- Total distance spat by Sydney: \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet

Next, we find the combined total distance spat by both:
- Combined total distance: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet

To find the average total distance spat, we divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2):
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is 410 feet."

"First, let's determine the total duration of Cameron's stay. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, we calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour. The additional hours are:
\[ 17 - 12 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the initial 12-hour stay cost:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} + 350 \text{ pesos} = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours from the cost of the 24-hour stay:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1350 \text{ pesos} = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Thus, Cameron would save:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ pesos} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to account for the expenses. John spends $50 on gas, so his remaining money is:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John also wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so after the deposit, he will have:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $10 and he buys 5 pencils, so the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, the remaining money is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many $25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining $100. The number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and the teacher has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is calculated as follows:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the fixed visit charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Fixed Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The labor rate is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). Therefore, the labor charge is \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.
3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts is $60.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total charge:
\[
40 + 105 + 60 = 205
\]

Thus, the total charge for the job is \(\boxed{205}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total amount he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling the 5 CDs. The amount he was out initially was $90, and he received $200 from selling the 5 CDs. Therefore, the net amount he was out is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and the negative value indicates he gained money, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

1. **Yams:**

\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars."
"To determine the total time James took to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   James swims at half the initial speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add the time taken to swim the initial distance, the rest time, and the time taken to swim the remaining distance.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start by identifying the number of loaves Sam had last Friday, which is given as 70 loaves.

The problem states that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. We can express this relationship with the following calculation:

1. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]

2. Subtract 40 from this result to find the number of loaves the bakery has:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the bakery has \(\boxed{450}\) loaves of bread."

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 10\% \times 5 = 0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 8\% \times 15 = 0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, the total points scored by the three individuals is 45, so we have:

\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

We are also given that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. This gives us the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:

\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we know \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):

\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
   - The book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page per side.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   - Since 100 pages occupy 1 inch, the number of pages per inch is 100.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches:**
   - If 1 inch contains 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will contain:
     \[
     100 \text{ pages/inch} \times 1.5 \text{ inches} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Account for both sides of the paper:**
   - Each paper is printed on both sides, meaning each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages/sheet}} = 75 \text{ sheets}
     \]
   - Since each sheet has 2 pages, the total number of pages is:
     \[
     75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages/sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages in the book is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"First, let's determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the time Kim woke up that day:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - 6 a.m. is 6:00, so 5 minutes earlier is 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m.
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. is 1 hour (60 minutes).
   - From 3:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 2 hours and 40 minutes (160 minutes).
   - Total time awake before getting out of bed: \( 60 + 160 = 220 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was sleepwalking:**
   - From 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The difference is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake (including sleepwalking):**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes.
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes.
   - Total time awake: \( 220 + 23 = 243 \) minutes.

6. **Calculate the time Kim was actually on her bed:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes.
   - Total time awake: 243 minutes.
   - Time on bed: \( 480 - 243 = 237 \) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Occupancy Calculation:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially occupied beds = 200.
   - Additional occupied beds after 2 weeks = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity of the hospital = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means 6 emails are sent to family. The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. To find out how many emails are sent to her boyfriend, we subtract the number of family emails from the non-work emails:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to determine how many of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"First, we determine Shawna's age based on Aliya's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is \(\boxed{45}\) years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can represent the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \). According to Kelly, Courtney reported 120% of the actual number, which is 48. This can be expressed as:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Performing the division:

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of balls each boy carried in terms of Jeffrey's number of balls. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. Therefore, the total number of balls is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the relationship between the number of balls carried by each boy would still hold. If Jason carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get:
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the expression for the total number of balls, we get:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Thus, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"

Total holes dug by the end of the third day before filling in any holes:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \]

Next, the pirates filled in 2 holes on the third day:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \]

At the end of the third day, there were 29 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes was four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day was 10, so:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \). According to the problem, Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. Therefore, Collins received \( 70 + 15 = 85 \) corn chips.

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins. We can express this as:
\[
70 + 70 + 85
\]

Now, let's perform the addition:
\[
70 + 70 = 140
\]
\[
140 + 85 = 225
\]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets for travel. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The cost of the supplies is $400.

To find 50% of $400, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \). According to the problem, Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Then, divide both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:

\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. According to the problem, each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Northerly
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: Southerly
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Next, we sum the distances traveled in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled in the northerly direction:

- Total distance traveled southerly: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Distance traveled northerly: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance traveled in the southerly direction is:
\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[

"First, let's determine the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani is 8 years old and his brother is twice his age, the brother's age is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we need to find the age of Nani's sister. Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate:
\[ 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years} \]
So, Nani's sister is:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister to find the total age:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is:

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is $600 each. Therefore, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the costs of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \). Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \cdot 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24:**
   - Emil is currently 19 years old.
   - He will turn 24 in \(24 - 19 = 5\) years.

2. **Determine the age of Emil's dad when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
   - Let \(D\) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \(D + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\).

3. **Solve for \(D\):**
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   D = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

4. **Determine the age of Emil's brother when Emil is 24:**
   - When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
   - Let \(B\) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \(B + 5\) years old.
   - According to the problem, \(24 = 2(B + 5)\).

   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

6. **Calculate the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:**
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much money Pat will spend to fill her flower bed with plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of the plants and the spacing to the same unit:**
   - Each plant grows 12 inches wide. Convert this to feet: \( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 1 \text{ foot} \).
   - The space between each plant is 1.5 feet.

2. **Calculate the total space required for one plant and the space between it and the next plant:**
   - Space for one plant and the space between it and the next plant: \( 1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Determine the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.
   - Number of plants that can fit: \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \).
   - Since Pat can only have whole plants, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

4. **Calculate the number of additional plants needed:**
   - Pat already owns 17 plants.
   - Number of additional plants needed: \( 44 - 17 = 27 \).

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - Total cost: \( 27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With the remaining 3 pounds of soil, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly salary.

\[ 25\% \text{ of } \$2,000.00 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the $500.00 she sets aside each month. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per month} = \frac{\$500.00}{\$1,000.00} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs per month, which means she can buy 1 pair every 2 months.

Now, let's calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year. There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of pairs of shoes per year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months per pair}} = 6 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

     \text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp:**
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, we calculate the time required as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total Time:**
   - The total time required is the sum of the time to peel and the time to sauté:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final temperature change.

1. **Initial Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Subsequent Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner is then turned up to high for 4 hours.
   - It cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - Total cooling during this period: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Warming Up:**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - Total warming during this period: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Net Temperature Change:**
   - Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \( D \).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \( 3D \).

3. **Calculate the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Set up the equation for Bill's age at the second sighting:**
   - Let \( B \) be Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, the age difference between the first and second sighting is \( 3D - B = 75 \).

5. **Express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):**
   - We need to find \( B \). To do this, we need to express \( D \) in terms of \( B \). Since Bill saw the comet for the second time when he was \( 3D \) and the first time when he was \( B \), the difference in their ages when they saw the comet is the same as the time interval between the sightings. So, \( 3D - B = 75 \).

6. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - We need to find \( B \). Since \( D \) is the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet, and we know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was \( 3D \), we can use the fact that the time interval is 75 years to find \( B \).
   - If Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, then \( D = 30 \).
   - Substitute \( D = 30 \) into the equation \( 3D - B = 75 \):
     \[
     3 \times 30 - B = 75
     \]
     \[
     90 - B = 75
     \]
     \[
     B = 90 - 75
     \]
     \[
     B = 15
     \]

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes \(12\) checks for the electric bill.

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Similarly, he writes \(12\) checks for the gas bill.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church.
   - Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks to the church.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter (3 months) to the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes \(4\) checks to the pest and lawn service.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"To determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of flights to France (and also to Germany, since they are split equally).

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of flights:**
   - Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 \)
   - Flights to France: \( x \)
   - Flights to Germany: \( x \)

   The total number of flights is the sum of these:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 + x + x = 88
   \]

4. **Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 88 + 2x = 88
   \]
   \[
   66 + 2x = 88
   \]
   \[
   2x = 88 - 66
   \]
   \[
   2x = 22
   \]
   \[
   x = 11
   \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's howl**: Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's howl**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. Therefore, Chikote's howl lasts:
   \[
   2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]
3. **Igneous's howl**: Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls. Therefore, Igneous's howl lasts:
   \[
   20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total duration of all three wolves' howls combined:
\[
20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}\):
\[
\frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine how much money Adam received from his father. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the money given by his mother and his father to find the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, so the amount of money he had to contribute from his savings is the total cost of the trousers minus the money he received from his parents:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \( A = 3 \) years.
2. Alessandro's age \( B = 4 \) years.
3. The total age of the children is 20 years.
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age of the children as:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \( H + W = 13 \), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} = \frac{7 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Given that \( H \) is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) back into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be:
\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is:
\[ 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2x \text{ (each adult's slice)} + 4 \text{ (kids)} \times x \text{ (each kid's slice)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \( 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to add up the total time required for each step of the process and then subtract this total from 5:00 pm.

1. **Making the cake batter:** 20 minutes

First, let's add up the total time required:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm to find the latest start time:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"
"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we start by defining the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is equivalent to \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars. Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is equivalent to \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   The total population of porcupines is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   \[
   \text{Number of baby porcupines born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total number of baby porcupines born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   The initial population is 50, and we add the total number of baby porcupines born in a year.
   \[

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the number of gallons needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:
\[ V = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The conversion factor is that 1 cubic foot of water is approximately 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume in gallons \( G \) is:
\[ G = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 7.48 \, \text{gallons per cubic foot} \]
\[ G = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 10472 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} \]
\[ C = 1047.20 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{1047.20} \]"

   x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
   \]

   So, the charge at the start of the last 3 hours was approximately 34.8%.

3. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of these 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge is \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).

   \[
   y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
   \]

   \[
   y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
   \]

   So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.7%.

**Final Answer:**
The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.7%."
"First, let's calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25 per hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 1000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. So, the amount she needs to save is:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000. Since she earns $1000 per week, the number of weeks required is:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ dollars}}{1000 \text{ dollars/week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased.

- The cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- The cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- The cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, let's determine the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces she kept is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

The number of pieces left to give to her friends is:
\[ 900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne gave these 780 pieces to her 10 friends equally. Therefore, the number of pieces each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces} \]

So, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, given that the price increases by 5% each year, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the price after \( n \) years,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% increase),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them equally into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain only selfies and 2 of the albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can calculate the time per page as follows:

\[
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[
\text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time James spends reading 18 pages is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early checkouts:**
   24 guests elected to check out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

3. **Late checkouts:**
   15 guests elected to check out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests remaining}
   \]

4. **Afternoon check-ins:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests checked in}
   \]
   Adding these to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Additional check-ins after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"To determine the total number of bananas John has, we need to calculate the number of bananas he picked each day and then sum them up.

1. On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
2. On Thursday, John picks 6 bananas.
3. On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the number of bananas picked each day:
\[4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22\]

So, the total number of bananas John has is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total number of questions: 60
   - Percentage of easy questions: 40%
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - The rest of the questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of average and difficult questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
     Since these are equally divided:
     \[
     \text{Number of average questions} = \text{Number of difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - For easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Number of easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so we have:
\[ L = 3S \]
We are also given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[ S = 4 \]
Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is:
\[ L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales of large stuffed animals is:
\[ x \times L = x \times 12 \]
The total earnings from the sales of small stuffed animals is:
\[ 2x \times S = 2x \times 4 = 8x \]
The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is given as $120, so we can write the equation:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 20x = 120 \]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]
So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[
0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.92
\]

This means there is a 92% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework. Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[
100\% - 92\% = 8\%
\]

"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for guests:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Jim to earn back the money he spent on college and the money he lost from not working, we need to calculate the total cost of his education and the lost income, and then find out how long it will take him to earn that amount with his new income.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the loans:**
   Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loan cost} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the lost income:**
   Jim had a job that paid $25,000 per year before going to college. Without working during college, he lost 4 years of income.
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   The total cost includes both the loans and the lost income.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine Jim's new income:**
   Jim's new income is triple his previous income.
   \[
   \text{New income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time to earn back the total cost:**
   To find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total cost of $300,000 at his new income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total cost by his new income.
   \[
   \text{Time to earn back} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as they did on Monday. First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this amount:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as they did on Tuesday. First, we calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( L_1 = 5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount won in the second race: \( W_2 = 2 \times L_1 + 1 = 2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( L_3 = 1.5 \times W_2 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)

4. **Total Loss and Total Amount:**
   - Total loss: \( L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \)
   - Total amount won: \( W_2 = 11 \)
   - Net loss: \( \text{Total loss} - \text{Total amount won} = 21.5 - 11 = 10.5 \)

5. **Average Loss:**
   - Number of races: 3
   - Average loss per race: \( \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17 \)

Therefore, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{7.17}\)."
"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the number of people living in each city.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population of South America, based on the given conditions, is:

"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. We'll use inches since the final heights of both Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

1. **Xavier's height now:**
   - Xavier was originally 4 feet tall.
   - 1 foot = 12 inches, so 4 feet = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Xavier's current height is \(48 + 3 = 51\) inches.

2. **Cole's height now:**
   - Cole was originally 50 inches tall.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer.
   - Therefore, Cole's current height is \(50 + 2 = 52\) inches.

3. **Difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**
   - Cole's height now is 52 inches.
   - Xavier's height now is 51 inches.

"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team:**
   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - Therefore, the hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.25}

"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

From the problem, we know:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

First, combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2 \cdot (2x) + 2 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} = 2 \cdot 19
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is \( x = 6 \). To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car retains 79% (100% - 21%) of its value from the previous year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and \( n = 3 \) years.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the factor by which the value is reduced each year:
\[ 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

2. Apply this factor for 3 years:
\[ 20000 \times 0.79^3 \]

3. Calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[ 0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493039 \]

4. Multiply the initial value by this factor:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 \approx 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

   - The rest of the books are written in Spanish.
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = \text{Total number of books} - \text{Number of English books} - \text{Number of German books}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is \(\boxed{20}\)."

   \]

2. **First stop:**
   - 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Second stop:**
   - 50 people descend from the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 = 90 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Twice the number of people who descended (which is 50) board the train.
   \[
   2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ people}
   \]
   - Adding these 100 people to the current number of people on the train.
   \[
   90 + 100 = 190 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Third stop:**
   - 80 more people descend from the train.

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.

Greg puts clean sheets on:
- 4 twin beds every week
- 1 king size bed every week

Since he changes the sheets every week, in a year (52 weeks), he will use:
- \(4 \text{ twin beds} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 208 \text{ twin sheets}\)
- \(1 \text{ king bed} \times 52 \text{ weeks} = 52 \text{ king sheets}\)

Next, we need to calculate the number of loads of laundry required for these sheets, given the machine's capacity:
- The machine can wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time.
- The machine can wash 1 king set of sheets at a time.

For the twin sheets:
- \( \frac{208 \text{ twin sheets}}{2 \text{ twin sheets per load}} = 104 \text{ loads}\)

For the king sheets:
- \( \frac{52 \text{ king sheets}}{1 \text{ king sheet per load}} = 52 \text{ loads}\)

"First, let's determine the number of each type of coupon Anthony is sending out.

Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of postage, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"

   - The remaining 3 sub sandwiches already have 12 meatballs.
   - The additional 3 sub sandwiches have 12 meatballs.
   - \( 12 + 12 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
\]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver the fertiliser. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To determine the cost for Dennis to purchase the butter needed for 6 dozen croissants, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Therefore, for 6 dozen croissants, he needs:
   \[
   6 \text{ pounds of butter}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Determine the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   Let's break down the cost for 6 pounds of butter under the promotion:
   - For the first pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the second pound, he gets half off, so the cost is:
     \[
     \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the third pound, the cost is again $4.00.
   - For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so the cost is:
     \[
     \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For the fifth pound, the cost is $4.00.
   - For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so the cost is:
     \[
     \frac{4.00}{2} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Adding up the costs for each pound:
   \[
   4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 + 4.00 + 2.00 = 16.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{16.00}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Next, we need to account for the 4 people who said they could not come. Therefore, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The cost to rent the theater is a fixed fee of $125. Additionally, there is a charge of $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20 guests. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the fixed rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

First, we know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie originally had. Since she spent a quarter of her money, she has three-quarters of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, we know that Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza originally had. Since she spent one-third of her money, she has two-thirds of her money left. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we need to determine how much money each of them has left. Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left. Therefore, the total amount of money they have left together is:
\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]
So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas consumed by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Next, we calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).

The total number of bananas consumed by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since this total is the number of bananas consumed each day, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas consumed in a week is:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

We can now solve for \(x\):
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]
\[24 + x = \frac{315}{7}\]
\[24 + x = 45\]
\[x = 45 - 24\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we need to consider the pieces he completed in each puzzle.

1. For the first puzzle, Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, he placed:
   \[
   \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. For the second puzzle, Teddy completed the entire 500 piece puzzle, so he placed:
   \[
   500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Adding the pieces from both puzzles together, we get:
\[
250 + 500 = 750 \text{ pieces}
\]

Thus, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[
\boxed{750}

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since roses cost $2 each, the total cost for 15 roses is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Jenny has initially. She arrived with five $5 bills, so she has:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of the roses is $30 and Jenny only has $25, she does not have enough money to buy the roses. Therefore, she cannot complete the purchase and will not receive any change in quarters.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item sold and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake is priced at $5.50.
   - Revenue from milkshakes = \( 6 \times 5.50 \).

\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33
\]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter is priced at $11.
   - Revenue from burger platters = \( 9 \times 11 \).

\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda is priced at $1.50.
   - Revenue from sodas = \( 20 \times 1.50 \).

\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30
\]

4. **Sum the revenues from all items:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from milkshakes + Revenue from burger platters + Revenue from sodas.

\[
33 + 99 + 30 = 162
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is \(\boxed{162}\)."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step to determine when Paul's train arrives and how long he waits.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 30 minutes after it arrives (10 + 20).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 35 minutes after it arrives (30 + 5).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it arrives and leaves at the same time.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Since the third train leaves immediately after it arrives, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train arrives.

Now, let's calculate the exact times:

- First train arrives at \( t = 10 \) minutes.
- First train leaves at \( t = 30 \) minutes.
- Second train arrives at \( t = 30 + 30 = 60 \) minutes.
- Second train leaves at \( t = 60 + 5 = 65 \) minutes.
- Third train arrives and leaves at \( t = 65 \) minutes.
- Fourth train arrives at \( t = 65 + 20 = 85 \) minutes.

Paul boards the fourth train at \( t = 85 \) minutes. Since he arrives at the station at \( t = 0 \) minutes, the total waiting time is:

\[
85 - 0 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Paul waits for his train is \(\boxed{85}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from her goal:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie continues to save at the same rate of 10 toothpicks per week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend paid for the watch:**
   - Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend paid} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

3. **Determine the discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $1800.
   - The discount is the difference between the original price and the price paid by Mr. Rogers' friend.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage discount:**
   - The percentage discount is the discount divided by the original price, multiplied by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of seconds in 4 hours is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create:
     \[
     5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is:
\[
\boxed{72000}
\]"
"To find Frankie's score, we start by defining the relationship between Frankie's score and Binkie's score based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score, and \( F \) represent Frankie's score. According to the problem, Binkie's score is 90, so we have:
\[ B = 90 \]

The problem states that Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. This can be written as:
\[ F = 2B + 15 \]

Substituting Binkie's score into the equation:
\[ F = 2(90) + 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication and addition:
\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

Thus, Frankie's score is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. **Distance to the store**: 4 miles.
2. **Halfway point**: 2 miles (since 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles).
3. **Distance walked to the halfway point**: 2 miles.
4. **Distance walked back home**: 2 miles.
5. **Total distance walked**: 2 miles (to the halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) = 4 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find the time it took him to walk the total distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny had bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars per banana} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars per bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is the difference between the two costs:
\[ 32 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[
\text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Next, we use this annual growth rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 15\% \times 300 = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Determine the price of each type of bike:**
   - MTB: $500
   - BMX: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = 250 \)
   - Trekking: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)

4. **Sum the earnings from all types of bikes:**
   \[
   52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the net number of bales added to or removed from the field each hour and then extend that over the 6-hour workday.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer each hour:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck each hour:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales added to the field each hour:**
   - Net bales per hour = Bales made - Bales picked up
   - Net bales per hour = 5 - 3 = 2 bales

4. **Calculate the total number of bales added to the field over 6 hours:**
   - Total bales added = Net bales per hour × Number of hours
   - Total bales added = 2 × 6 = 12 bales

5. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the initial number of bales in the field, we assume the field starts with 0 bales.
   - Therefore, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total bales added.

The final number of bales of hay left in the field is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days. Therefore, the extra learning time is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time spent learning in a week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ \boxed{28.33} \]"
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height:**
   Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial drop height is:
   \[
   3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
   \[
   72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce:**
   The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
   \[
   48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}

"To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step.

1. **First Child:**
   - Height: 6 feet
   - Convert feet to inches: \( 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

2. **Second Child:**
   - Height: 2 inches taller than the first child
   - Calculation: \( 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \)

3. **Third Child:**
   - Height: 5 inches shorter than the second child
   - Calculation: \( 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \)

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - Height: 3 inches taller than the third child
   - Calculation: \( 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \)

"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( \boxed{1080} \) kilograms."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding the areas of all four walls together, we get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
- She shakes 3 of them.
- She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total.
- Now, there are 2 unshaken sodas and 3 shaken sodas.

Ellen's brother then takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas. After he takes these sodas, the remaining sodas are:
- Shaken sodas: \(3 - 1 = 2\)
- Unshaken sodas: \(2 - 2 = 0\)

So, there are now 2 shaken sodas left. When Ellen's friend comes along, the only sodas available are the 2 shaken ones. Since all remaining sodas are shaken, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 100%.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. **Calculate the speed of the second train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}\).

   For the first train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

   For the second train:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance between the two trains:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the two trains are \(\boxed{270}\) miles apart after 3 hours."
"First, let's determine the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. Adding the days from April 1st to April 19th gives us 19 more days. Therefore, the total number of days is:

\[31 + 19 = 50\]

Next, we need to calculate how many of these days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we calculate 20% of 50:

\[0.20 \times 50 = 10\]

This means Billy works on \(50 - 10 = 40\) days. Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day, so he helps:

\[2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ people per day}\]

Since he works 40 days, the total number of people he helps is:

\[6 \times 40 = 240\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[\boxed{240}\]"
"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry, which would be the maximum number of people that could have attended the ceremony.

First, we calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

\[
12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

\[
20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people that could have been inside the church:

\[
420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, the maximum number of people that could have been inside the church is:

\[
\boxed{480}

"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the biggest slide:
- The length of the biggest slide is 300 feet.
- The speed is 60 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to slide down the second biggest slide:
- The length of the second biggest slide is 240 feet.
- The speed is 80 feet per minute.

The time to slide down the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{\text{Length}_{\text{second biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second biggest}}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 30 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, the daily total is 1 hour.

Now, we need to find out how many hours this totals over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"First, let's determine how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the number of miles Ahito ran is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the new balance on Sheila's credit card.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan:**
   She bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
   Add this to her current balance:
   \[
   70.00 + 16.00 = 86.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
\[ \frac{J}{5} \]

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \]

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

1. **Amalia's time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's time:**
   - Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's time:**
   - Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours.
   - Therefore, Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours + 1 hour (to ensure it's ""well over 4 hours"") = 9 hours.

Now, we sum up the total time spent by all three individuals:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Amalia's time} + \text{Megan's time} + \text{Dior's time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk \(\boxed{35}\) miles in 7 days."
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the other four workers and then find out how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order.

First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first two workers:
- Each of the first two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(6 \times 10 = 60\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(60 \times 2 = 120\) toys.

Next, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- They work for 10 hours.
- Therefore, each of these workers produces \(4 \times 10 = 40\) toys.
- Together, they produce \(40 \times 2 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's find the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 120 toys.
- The next two workers produce 80 toys.
- Together, they produce \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380\]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180\] toys.

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours they worked:
\[ \frac{180}{10} = 18 \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"First, let's determine the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

\[ 3 \text{ large bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per large bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many M&M are in these 30 ounces. Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

John wants to put 10 M&M in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M by the number of M&M per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, John can make \(\boxed{90}\) small bags."
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate half of the circumference of the earth:**
   The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days it takes for Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers:**
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it takes for him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   - The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   - The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   \[
   \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is \(\boxed{750}\) miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

**Vince is now 9 years old.**"
"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs painted by Arnold.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs painted by Madeline.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs painted by Camden.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:
\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, and Nik has 200 crayons, so the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The combined weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight in pounds is:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = \( 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \) feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount John makes is:

"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Thus, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ \boxed{45000} \]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. Since the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time:
\[
\text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we are told that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[
\text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Now, we need to find the time spent walking on the sidewalk. The sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile, and her speed on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\). Thus, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[
\text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to find the total time for the entire walk:
\[
\text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the remaining amount by her weekly savings.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"First, let's determine how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. Therefore, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtract 24 from both sides to solve for the original number of marbles:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 36 \]

Now, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we subtract 10 from his original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we need to ensure that after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into the water bottle, the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water into the water bottle, the resulting mixture will be a weighted average of the two temperatures. The formula for the resulting temperature \( T_{\text{result}} \) is:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times T}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
T_{\text{result}} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can drink the water if the resulting temperature is at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Thus, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after pouring the specified amounts.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"

1. **Initial number of animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Number of days in three weeks:**
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

3. **Cows added per day:**
   - 20 cows/day

4. **Total cows added in 21 days:**
   - 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

5. **Total cows after three weeks:**
   - Initial cows + Cows added = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

6. **Chickens added per day:**
   - 10 chickens/day

7. **Total chickens added in 21 days:**
   - 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

8. **Total chickens after three weeks:**
   - Initial chickens + Chickens added = 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

9. **Total number of animals after three weeks:**
   - Total cows + Total chickens = 470 + 230 = 700 animals

**Final answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost. A 10% discount means Russell pays 90% of the total cost. So, the cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack contains 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   Therefore, to find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 18 scoops, and each scoop requires 1.5 potatoes.
   \[
   18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for 30 days: \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}\).

2. **Next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs for the next 30 days: \(5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Total eggs for 60 days:**
   - Sum of eggs from both periods: \(90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}\).

4. **Convert eggs to dozens:**
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.
   - Total dozens of eggs: \(\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of lemons Tim collects from one tree in one year.
2. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees in one year.
3. Calculate the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade (10 years).

Step 1: Lemons from one tree in one year
Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree each year. Since he has 5 trees, the number of lemons from one tree in one year is 6.

Step 2: Total lemons from all trees in one year
Since Tim has 5 trees, the total number of lemons from all trees in one year is:
\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Step 3: Total lemons from all trees over a decade
A decade is 10 years, so the total number of lemons from all trees over a decade is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially based on the given ratio and total number of passengers.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio are \(5 + 9 = 14\).

Given that the total number of passengers is 84, we can find the value of one part of the ratio by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts of the ratio:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
\[
\text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54
\]

After 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

"To determine the probability that both of Mark's lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a probability of \(0.20\).
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   - The probability of both events happening (both tickets winning) is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the combined probability is \(0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\).

3. **Convert the combined probability to a percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, multiply by 100.
   - \(0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\).

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."

   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekdays = \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \).

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each day.
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - Total carrots on weekends = \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \).

3. **Total carrots in a week:**
   - Total carrots = Carrots on weekdays + Carrots on weekends
   - Total carrots = \( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \).

Therefore, Mason eats \(\boxed{30}\) carrots a week."
"To determine the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of each song and then sum them up.

1. The first song is 5 minutes long.
2. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the duration of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original duration of the first song to get the duration of the second song:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"

   - Therefore, the selling price of one device is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the devices bought last Monday:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices last Monday.
   - The cost of each device is $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 2 devices is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the devices bought last Monday:**
   - Linus sold 2 devices at $40 each.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the profit from the devices bought last Monday:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   - Therefore, the profit from the devices bought last Monday is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex needs to produce \( \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \) bottles of juice per person.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces daily:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

4. **Calculate the additional number of bottles needed:**
   - The additional number of bottles required is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional \(\boxed{7300}\) bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's determine the number of octuplets dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 identical octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers who wear bows:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of babies wearing bows is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50.
   \[
   \text{Land sold first} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he earns $50 from this sale.

2. **Second Sale:**
   After the first sale, he has 40 square meters left. He then sells a quarter of the remaining land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Land sold second} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   So, he earns $30 from this sale.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   After the second sale, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30). He sells the remaining land at $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Money from final sale} = 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Earnings:**
   Now, we add up all the money he earned from the sales.
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third apartment complex. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so combined they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of apartments John collects from all three complexes:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:

\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1248}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life.

1. **Initial Production (5-year-old tree):**
   - A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

2. **Production at 6 years:**
   - A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount.
   - \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) fruits.

3. **Production at 7 years:**
   - A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount.
   - \( 7 \times 50 = 350 \) fruits.

4. **Production at 8 years:**
   - An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces.
   - Therefore, \( x - 200 \) fruits.

5. **Production at 10 years:**
   - A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount.
   - \( 20 \times 50 = 1000 \) fruits.
   - So, \( x = 1000 \).

6. **Production at 9 years:**
   - A 9-year-old tree produces no fruits.
   - \( 0 \) fruits.

Now, we can sum up the fruits produced each year from 5 to 10 years:

\[
50 \text{ (5 years)} + 150 \text{ (6 years)} + 350 \text{ (7 years)} + (1000 - 200) \text{ (8 years)} + 1000 \text{ (10 years)} + 0 \text{ (9 years)}
\]

Simplifying the expression:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2450
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( R = 4B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into \( B = Y - 7 \):
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, substitute \( B = 5 \) into \( R = 4B \):
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]
According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
Solving for \( x \), we subtract 12 from 15:
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]
So, each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so he is left with:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]
Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used:**
   The mural used a total of 12 pints of paint.

2. **Define the variables for the amounts of each color:**
   Let \( R \) represent the amount of red paint.
   Let \( W \) represent the amount of white paint.
   Let \( P \) represent the amount of purple paint.
   Let \( Y \) represent the amount of yellow paint.

3. **Set up the relationships based on the problem statement:**
   - The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, \( R = W = P \).
   - Half the mural is yellow, so \( Y = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) pints.

4. **Express the total amount of paint in terms of \( R \):**
   Since \( R = W = P \), we can write the total amount of paint as:
   \[
   R + W + P + Y = 12
   \]
   Substituting \( W \) and \( P \) with \( R \) and \( Y \) with 6, we get:
   \[
   R + R + R + 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   3R + 6 = 12
   \]

6. **Solve for \( R \):**
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   3R = 6
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   R = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is \(\boxed{2}\) pints."
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Thus, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we need to calculate the number of clouds each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24
   \]
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48

"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 0.20 \times 100 \text{ pods} = 100 \text{ pods} + 20 \text{ pods} = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the cost per cycle is $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per cycle:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per cycle}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining 40 bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4\) (first half) + \(2\) (second half) = \(6\) goals.
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2\) (first half) + \(8\) (second half) = \(10\) goals.
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6\) (Team A) + \(10\) (Team B) = \(16\) goals.

Now, we find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students in the class. The total number of students is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students}
\]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled:**
   The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Calculate the number of teeth capped:**
   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is:
   \[
   4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of teeth fixed:**
   The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
   \[
   4 + 11 = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   James has 30 teeth in total. The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is:
\[
\boxed{50\%}

"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

The amount of milk returned is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

The refund amount is:
\[
1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5(C + 7) \):
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:**
   - Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000, we divide $27000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy:**
   - Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books is:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400
     \]

3. **Determine the number of books per school:**
   - Bob distributes the books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide the total number of books by 3:
     \[
     \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
     \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy:
- 3 cheese pizzas
- 3 pepperoni pizzas

The total number of pizza pies she needs to buy is:

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

First, let's calculate the net rate of snowball production. Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many snowballs melt in an hour. There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

This means that for every hour, Jay effectively gains:

\[ 20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:

\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since the question does not specify the current year, we can assume that the current year is the year of Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary is 20 years.

2. **Calculate John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let \(x\) be Jim's age 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, \(8 = 2x\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{8}{2} = 4\).

4. **Calculate Jim's current age:**
   - Jim was 4 years old 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\).

The final numerical answer is:

"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, the total number of slices they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. The deficit is 16 bandages, so they ordered 16 more bandages to cover the deficit and have 50 - 16 = 34 bandages at the end of the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 100
   - Bandages used: Half a bulk pack = 25
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means the initial number of bandages they had at the start of the first day must be adjusted to account for the 31 bandages difference (109 - 78 = 31).

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 - 31 = -19 + 50 = 31\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{31}\)."

\[ 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings from her hourly rate for April are:
\[ \$67.5 \, \text{per week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$270 \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences in April, she also receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine the amount of blood a single shark has. According to the information provided, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have in total. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at different times.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so:

\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and Mattison is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the height of the second floor from the ground. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the ground to the second floor is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the same as the height of the second floor from the ground, which is 240 inches. Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average.
2. Subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk.

First, we know the average miles walked per day by the four dogs is 3 miles. Therefore, the total miles walked by all four dogs per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add up the miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles to find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of his home's value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find out how much money John has leftover after paying his debts by subtracting the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount.

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

To perform the multiplication:

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters} \).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 \, \text{liter/day} = 2 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters} \).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 \, \text{liters/day} = 4 \, \text{liters/day} \).
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters} \).

Finally, we sum the water removed at each setting to find the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement:

\[
3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of each class in John's school. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by isolating the variable. First, add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Then, divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

To find \(x\), we need to solve for \(x\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12
\]

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to break down the costs and then calculate the annual expenditure.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is:
     \[
     1 \text{ box/week} \times \$1.00/\text{box} = \$1.00/\text{week}
     \]

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of cheddar cheese is:
     \[
     \$3.00/\text{week}
     \]

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - The cost of gruyere cheese per week is:
     \[
     2 \times \$3.00 = \$6.00/\text{week}

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to clean all classrooms:**
   - There are 80 classrooms.
   - It takes 15 minutes to clean each classroom.
   - Total time required = \( 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Convert the total time required into days:**
   - The custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms.
   - Total time required = 1200 minutes.
   - Time available per day = 8 hours/day = \( 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of days required to clean all classrooms:**
   - Total time required = 1200 minutes.
   - Time available per day = 480 minutes/day.
   - Number of days required = \( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \).

4. **Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day:**
   - Since the custodian has 5 days to clean and it takes 2.5 days to clean all classrooms, the average time spent cleaning per day is the total time required divided by the number of days available.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = \( \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \).

5. **Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning:**
   - Time available per day = 480 minutes.
   - Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes.
   - Percentage of the day spent cleaning = \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \times 100\% = 50\% \).

"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Since a bookcase has one top shelf, one bottom shelf, and two middle shelves, the total capacity is:
\[15 + 20 + 2 \times 10 = 15 + 20 + 20 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Next, we need to determine how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Since 110 divided by 55 is exactly 2, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Rose will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's determine the cost of one bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag and the bag now costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of beef jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total to pass.

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then, divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. To find the number of blueberry cubes, we substitute \( S = 20 \) into the expression for the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

Now, we calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of people: 50

2. **Second Day:**
   - Number of people: 50 + 20 = 70

3. **Third Day:**
   - Number of people: 2 * 70 = 140

4. **Rest of the Week (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th days):**
   - Average number of people per day: 60
   - Total number of people for the rest of the week: 60 * 4 = 240

5. **Total Number of People for the Week:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat.

1. **Initial Popping Rate:**
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

2. **Second 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples.
   - \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) kernels pop.

3. **Third 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples.
   - \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \) kernels pop.

4. **Fourth 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is halved.
   - \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \) kernels pop.

5. **Final 30 Seconds:**
   - The popping rate is the same as the fourth 30 seconds, which is 40 kernels.
   - After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop again.
   - \( 40 \div 4 = 10 \) additional kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Second 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Third 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Fourth 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- Final 30 seconds (additional): 10 kernels

Total number of kernels that popped:

"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the total amount of lemon juice required for the lemonade and then convert that into the number of lemons.

First, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the pool party:
- Each gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- Therefore, 4 gallons will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

Next, let's calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart:
- Since the lemonade is twice as tart, it will require twice the amount of lemon juice.
- Therefore, the extra gallon will require \(2 \times 1 = 2\) cups of lemon juice.

Now, let's find the total amount of lemon juice needed:
- Total lemon juice = lemon juice for 4 gallons + lemon juice for the extra gallon
- Total lemon juice = \(4 + 2 = 6\) cups

Next, we need to determine how many lemons are required to get 6 cups of lemon juice:
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Therefore, to get 6 cups of juice, Tim will need \(6 \times 6 = 36\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed for the dogs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) kilograms.

Next, calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.
- Therefore, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) kilograms.

"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start by defining the quantities of each type of block. We know the following:

1. The tower has 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(r\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks. According to the problem, this total is 32 blocks. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[4 + 8 + r = 32\]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[12 + r = 32\]

To find \(r\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[r = 32 - 12\]
\[r = 20\]

Thus, the number of red blocks is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel:
- Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.
- The cost of one night at the hotel is $80.
- Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
  \[
  3 \text{ nights} \times \$80 \text{ per night} = \$240
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips:

"To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is \(40 \times 0.6 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount spent = \(12 + 24 = 36\) dollars.

"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of completing his chores. Since he gets $6 each week, we can calculate his total allowance as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan uses some of this money to buy ice cream cones for himself and his 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:

\[ 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} \times 4 \text{ cones} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance, we get:

\[ 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies. The cost of one movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \text{ dollars} \div 6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

Since the result is a whole number, Ryan can buy exactly 2 movie tickets. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog continues to dig 6 new holes each night. Therefore, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

We need to determine how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took for Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

First, let's establish the relationship between Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

1. **Determine Aaron's and Vanessa's running speeds:**
   - Let \( v_V \) be Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
   - Let \( v_A \) be Aaron's speed in miles per minute.
   - According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so \( v_A = 2v_V \).

2. **Determine the distances run by Aaron and Vanessa:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the time it took Aaron to run his part:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can find Aaron's speed:
     \[
     v_A = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]
   - Since \( v_A = 2v_V \), we can find Vanessa's speed:
     \[
     v_V = \frac{v_A}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time it took Vanessa to run her part:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles at a speed of \( \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.

     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took \(\boxed{64}\) minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

First, we calculate the total amount of line needed. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He already has 6 feet of line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night's reservations.

For one night:
- They order 2 meals per reservation, and there are 6 reservations.
- Each meal costs $5.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine per night.

So, the cost for the meals per night is:
\[ 2 \text{ meals/reservation} \times 6 \text{ reservations} \times \$5/\text{meal} = 12 \text{ meals} \times \$5/\text{meal} = \$60 \]

The cost for the wine per night is:
\[ \$5 \]

Therefore, the total cost per night is:
\[ \$60 + \$5 = \$65 \]

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ \$65 \text{ per night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = \$130 \]

So, the total amount they make in a week, assuming the cost is what they spend (and not the revenue from sales), is:
\[ \boxed{130} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage})
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Thus, after an hour, Ana will have peeled \(\boxed{5}\) more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost of the radiator is $400, and Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of mechanic's labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"First, let's determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since each of the 7 pizzas is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

Next, we need to divide these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have \(\boxed{14}\) slices."
