"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

Next, we need to account for the eggs Janet uses:
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
- She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends every day.

So, the total number of eggs used each day is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid to find out how many eggs are left to sell:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs each day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"To find the total meters James runs in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total distance James runs in one session.
2. Multiply that by the number of sessions he has in a week.

First, in one session, James runs 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the distance he runs in one session is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Next, since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in Toulouse + Number of sheep in Charleston + Number of sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**

   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we can find out how many students are left to enroll in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

"To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total distance of the trip: 60 miles.
2. Determine the distance to the first stop: 20 miles.
3. Determine the distance to the end of the trip from the second stop: 15 miles.

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles calculated above:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on this care in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"First, let's determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. 

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys. Each video game costs $20, so:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the money he spent on the video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. We can confirm this by subtracting the cost of the video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed. Therefore, her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we need to calculate the time she spends running and walking in the six-hour period.

Total time: 6 hours
- One-third of the time running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
- Two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

Distance running:
\[ \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Distance walking:
\[ \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, the age of Ben's iPhone is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is the initial number of pieces minus the remaining pieces:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:**
104"
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

First, let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot. So, a 4-foot long wire is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from a 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.**

There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly earnings are:

   - Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour.
   - He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. Calculate the time it takes to travel back at 6 mph:
   - Distance to travel back = 30 miles.
   - Speed on the return trip = 6 mph.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This can be calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys that need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360\)
- For car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160\)

So, the total revenue for Thursday is:
\[
\$360 + \$160 = \$520
\]

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480\)

Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the total revenue for Friday is:
\[
\$480
\]

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. The revenue on Thursday is \$520, and on Friday it is \$480. The difference is:
\[
\$520 - \$480 = \$40

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial annual pension**: Marcy gets an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years.

2. **Determine the additional pension after 20 years**: Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

3. **Calculate the additional pension after 20 years**: Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive the additional 5% for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30).

4. **Calculate the total annual pension after 30 years**:
   - The initial annual pension is $50,000.
   - The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is \(0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500\).

5. **Sum the initial and additional pensions**:
   - Total annual pension = Initial annual pension + Additional annual pension
   - Total annual pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information given.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's break down the time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is \(2 \div 2 = 1\) hour.

So, each time he does this, he spends a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours on TV and reading.

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent in a week is:
\[3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\]

To find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

\[ 5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is the sum of the original cost and the interest:

\[ \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:

\[ \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay each month for 3 months:

"To solve this problem, let's define the amount of laundry each person does in terms of a variable.

Let \( D \) be the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

"First, we need to determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee's current time is 38 seconds, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:

\[ \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's current time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we need to calculate Gerald's new time after his speed improved by 10%. An improvement in speed by 10% means that Gerald can now run 10% faster, which is equivalent to running 90% of his original time (since 100% - 10% = 90%).

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} \times 0.90 = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs. Therefore, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Therefore, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pets is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{348}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in Grade 5.

The total number of students is 200, and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\) hours.

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[9 - 6 = 3\]

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, after the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam at all.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:

Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Next, we need to determine how many potted plants she will give away. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, the total number of potted plants she will give away is:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

Now, we can find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving some away. We start with the 80 potted plants she already has and subtract the 40 potted plants she will give away:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Mary will also receive 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. Adding these to the 40 potted plants she will have left after giving some away, we get:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell \( 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell rings:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175
\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \( 175 \)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

- Science textbook: 4 pages
- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he still has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"First, let's calculate how many pieces Poppy places on the board. She places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of a dimension).

The inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Now, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To find out how much the gas will cost after the cashback rewards, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons.
\[ \text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final cost.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate.
3. Add the totals from both to get the combined total.
4. Divide the combined total by 2 to find the average.

Let's start with Beatrice:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we can break down the problem step by step.

2. Each lesson uses the whiteboard, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.
3. There are 4 teachers.

First, calculate the number of lessons per day for all teachers combined:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we calculate the total number of cleanings per day:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned \(\boxed{24}\) times in a day."

"Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we can express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by 7x. Substituting the value of x, we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[42\]"

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.

Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many friends Amy has.
2. Add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has.

First, we know that Lily made 50 friends. According to the problem, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Next, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has to find the total number of friends they have together:
\[ \text{Total number of friends} = \text{Number of friends Amy has} + \text{Number of friends Lily has} = 70 + 50 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. **Cost of a watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon = \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

2. **Cost of an orange:**
   - An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of an orange = \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

3. **Total cost for Dillon:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
   - Total cost for watermelons = \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
   - Total cost for peppers = \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
   - Total cost for oranges = \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend = \(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves remaining is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we first need to determine his expenditure for June. Given that his expenditure in May was $500 and it was $60 less in June, we can calculate his June expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \text{Expenditure in May} - 60 = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures of both months to find the total expenditure:

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used, we need to calculate the total number of rides they took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of roller coaster rides:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides = 2 (Pam) + 4 (Fred) = 6 rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of luge rides:
- Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each.
- Total luge rides = 2 (Pam) + 2 (Fred) = 4 rides.

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides = 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
- Total tickets = 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

Therefore, the total number of tickets they used that day is:
60"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the first test is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- The test consisted of 100 questions.
- Mark's rate is 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he completed in the second test is:

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the relationship given in the problem. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

According to the problem, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk is a food item, costing $2.
- Eggs are a food item, costing $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, costing $3.
- Cups are non-food items, costing $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, costing $4.

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

There is a 10% tax on the non-food items, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

Kim already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so the total number of clients will be:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total expenses for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

First, we know that John has 10 hectares of pineapple field and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many harvests he can make in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year by multiplying the number of pineapples per harvest by the number of harvests per year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

"First, let's calculate the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came by to get both tires inflated, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came by to get their unicycle tire inflated, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Next, we add up all the tires inflated:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Let's work backwards from the end:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:

- Rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
- Chocolate croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
- Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since 1 foot = 12 inches, and each baguette is 2 feet long, so \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches)

Next, we add up the total length in inches:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Now, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:

   - Total cost for the rim of bond paper = \( 20 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
\[ 6 \text{ (pens)} + 8 \text{ (notebooks)} + 20 \text{ (rim of bond paper)} = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out from under a lily pad, so the number of tadpoles he can see increases to \(11 + 6 = 17\). After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see now is \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is:
15"
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Convert the percentage increase to a decimal:**
   \[
   20\% = 0.20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

7. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and its accessories and then subtract this from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of all the items Elvira is purchasing:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so not added again)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so not added again)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €157 = €1404
3. €1404 + €74 = €1478
4. €1478 + €102 = €1580

The total cost of the items is €1580. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required to make 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. Therefore, for 15 Spanish flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, we can calculate how much money Jimmy has as follows:

Twice the money Ethel has is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

So, Jimmy has $18. 

Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the miles he walks from Monday to Friday is \(20 \times 5 = 100\) miles.

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the miles he walks on the weekend is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) miles.

Therefore, the total miles he walks in a week is \(100 + 20 = 120\) miles.

120"
"First, let's determine the cost of each item in the uniform:

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}

   - Total legs from insects: \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Number of rare mutant invertebrates: 3
   - Legs per rare mutant invertebrate: 10
   - Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Now, we sum the legs from all the creatures:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

"First, let's calculate the total minimum monthly payment Jessica needs to make on all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Therefore, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:

$1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time Billy will spend peeling and cutting the potatoes, we need to break down the process into two parts: peeling and cutting.

1. **Peeled Potatoes:**
   - Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food.

The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many peaches John collects, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends collecting peaches.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the rate at which he collects peaches.

First, we know that John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total number of minutes as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly need into a daily need.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly need is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"First, let's determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"
"To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we can follow these steps:

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:

- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:

"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times she mows the lawn.
- She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour) into the formula, we get:

"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons. 

The final answer is:

The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. So, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

"First, let's determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information given.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Time to finish one crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3
- Total time spent on crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Time to finish one sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of sudoku puzzles solved = 8
- Total time spent on sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, we add the time spent on both activities:
- Total time spent = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"First, we need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of $15000 on advertising, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

**Total amount spent on advertising for the two years: $20000.**"
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \( 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \( 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \).

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount they will pay:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \( 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Next, we calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer, we get:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"First, let's determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{\text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tomatoes eaten by both Steve and his girlfriend per day:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = \text{Tomatoes eaten by Steve per day} + \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Now, we need to find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = \text{Total tomatoes per day} \times 7 = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can determine the number of vines needed by dividing the total number of tomatoes needed per week by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.

3. **Letters Mike sends**: Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

4. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

5. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate over the two days and then determine the difference in calories consumed.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on Monday:
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

Next, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on Tuesday:
- Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

"First, let's find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

This means Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. So, the number of times Anne went down the slide is:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and 2 more cows are added to each stall, so each stall now has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We are asked to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is equal to $0.01, the total value of the pennies is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, the total value of the nickels is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Since 1 dime is equal to $0.10, the total value of the dimes is:
   \[
   20 \times 0.10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Dollar bills**: Brady has 40 dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is equal to $1, the total value of the dollar bills is:
   \[
   40 \times 1 = 40 \text{ dollars}

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees, the time to heat to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.

"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

First, we calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes together gives:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars and then account for the stars in the other rows.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
   So, there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

2. Subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40
   \]
   So, there are 40 stars in the 5-star rows.

3. Determine the number of 5-star rows by dividing the number of 5-star stars by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula for time, which is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's determine the total time Susan works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the working time from hours to minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated in 10-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:

\[ 15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"First, let's determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Next, we check if each player gets an extra point in the fourth round:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, we sum up the points of all three players after the extra points have been distributed:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
83"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Will buys 15 oranges.
2. He has two sons who will wash oranges based on their ages.
3. The oldest son is 8 years old, so he will wash 8 oranges.
4. The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so he is 4 years old, and he will wash 4 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of oranges washed:

- Oranges washed by the oldest son: 8
- Oranges washed by the youngest son: 4

Total oranges washed = 8 + 4 = 12

Will originally had 15 oranges. After the sons wash 12 oranges, the number of unwashed oranges is:

15 - 12 = 3

So, the final number of unwashed oranges is:

"First, let's calculate the number of each activity Darren does on the second day:

- Pushups: \(100 + 20 = 120\)
- Squats: \(50 - 10 = 40\)
- Dumbbell presses: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Finally, let's add up all the activities to get the total count:

\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.

Rice consumed per meal by the household = 5 members * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg per meal.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:

Rice consumed per day = 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed per week is:

Rice consumed per week = 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

Number of weeks = 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people, making it a total of 4 bids including her initial bid.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. The first bid after the opening bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

So, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service annually, we need to break down the costs into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
```
31800

"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to understand the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, will produce two pages on the front and two pages on the back, making a total of four pages per piece of paper.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the total number of pages**: The tabloid has 32 pages.
2. **Determine the number of pages per piece of paper**: Each piece of paper, when folded, produces 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back).
3. **Calculate the number of pieces of paper needed**: To find out how many pieces of paper are needed, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages produced per piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Thus, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks. She also spent an additional $10 on rides. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

To find out how much money is left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount of money left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to determine how many books she sold in the second year and then calculate the earnings based on the price per book.

First, let's summarize the information given:
- Total books in the collection: 250
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books remaining unsold: 50
- Price per book: $20
- Books sold in the first year: twice the number sold in the current year

From the information, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year} \]

We know the total number of books in the collection and the number of unsold books:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year} \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} \]
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings (without bonus)} = \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings (with bonus)} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so we calculate his total earnings for the month:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, calculate how many people he beat:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

\]

This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

Next, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100/\text{suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50/\text{suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, let's sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:

   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so his current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

4. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna and receiving more from his father.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

"To find the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of \(25 + 15 = 40\) people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, \(1/4 \times 40 = 10\) people left the party.

This means \(40 - 10 = 30\) people stayed at the party.

We are also given that 22 men stayed at the party. Since the total number of people who stayed is 30, the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is \(8\).

"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and since the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"First, let's determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together give a total of 26 pencils. We can express this as:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + \text{Number of loose pencils} = 26 \]

Since the number of loose pencils is 2, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are in 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add their pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Next, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are traded.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Next, we know that each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

Thus, the total monthly payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

\[
\boxed{224000}

"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used the $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total amount deducted from the $43 purchase is the reward plus the coupon amount:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount the customer paid is:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:

- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:

- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:

- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A)."

"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Therefore, for 8 batches, the sugar needed is \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces.

2. Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Therefore, for 1 batch, the sugar needed is \(70 \times 1 = 70\) ounces.

3. Add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to get the total:
   - Total sugar needed = sugar for suckers + sugar for fudge
   - Total sugar needed = \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."

"First, let's determine how many hot dogs each person ate.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so:
\[ \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so:
\[ \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
2. Find the total number of plant pots needed.
3. Subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots April bought.

First, we know that the school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. Therefore, the number of plant pots needed for the roses is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we add the number of plant pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of plant pots needed:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]

April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many plant pots she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number of plant pots she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

4. The result will be the amount she saved.

Let's go through the calculations step by step:

1. Andrea initially had $36.
2. She spent $11 on a sweater. So, the remaining amount after buying the sweater is:
   \[
   36 - 11 = 25
   \]
3. She then gave her brother $4. So, the remaining amount after giving her brother money is:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation by \( T \). Then we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job:
- She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours.
- So, her earnings from the first job are \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings from her second job:
- She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours.
- So, her earnings from the second job are \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.

Now, let's add her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs to find out her total savings:
- She already has $80 in savings.
- Adding the earnings from both jobs: \(80 + 200 + 75 = 355\) dollars.

Finally, let's determine how much more she needs to save to buy the phone:
- The phone costs $400.
- She has $355 saved.
- So, the amount she still needs to save is \(400 - 355 = 45\) dollars.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine the height of the second tree. Since it is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, and the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, the second tree is:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears Dean bought.

The cost of 6 toy cars at $2 each is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 5 teddy bears at $1 each is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - He initially had $10.
   - Amount left after buying gumballs = \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had before buying candy:**
   - Billy spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount spent on candy = $6.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

Thus, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"First, let's determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed. The problem states that a bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

The amount of stuffing for a Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds, and for a chihuahua bed, it is 2 pounds. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

First, we know that Sara currently has 8 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Erin's current points:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring 14 points."
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

Difference = Distance Cho hiked - Distance Chloe hiked
Difference = 112 km - 45 km = 67 km

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"First, let's determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel. Since Axel has 50 silver pesos, Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.
- Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together.

- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 silver pesos + Anna's 100 silver pesos = \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 gold pesos + Anna's 120 gold pesos = \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Finally, we add the total silver and gold pesos to find the overall total number of pesos they have together.

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all 36 cups, the total time it takes to sell all the lemonade is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total time:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members of the choir. So, initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

However, on the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Final numerical answer:
16"

\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

Now, let's find out how much money David saves by buying the bracelet instead of buying individual tickets:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The difference in cost is \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars.

Thus, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has:

- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for bows on these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means that the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services before the bundle discount:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu costs $10 a month.
- Disney Plus costs $10 a month.

So, the total cost without the bundle discount is:
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate the discount Tim gets by bundling these services. The discount is 20%, so the cost after the discount is 80% of the original cost:
\[ 30 \times 0.80 = 24 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 24 = 34 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Finally, we compare this to the $60 cable package to find out how much money Tim saves:
\[ 60 - 34 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day. This means he uses the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, we find the daily savings in energy consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

   - He has 40 cannolis.
   - Therefore, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **Calculate the new number of cannolis after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **Determine the new number of corns after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - He finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school.
   - He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.

2. **Determine the number of steps taken before the jog:**
   - Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, he must have taken \(10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000\) steps before his jog.

3. **Calculate the steps taken during the jog:**
   - He had already taken half of his 10,000 steps to and from school, which is \(10,000 / 2 = 5,000\) steps.
   - Adding the 1,000 steps from his short walk with his friend, he had taken \(5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000\) steps before his jog.
   - Therefore, the steps taken during his jog are \(8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000\).

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

So, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is:
\[ 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:

2. Determine how many dozens of cookies that total is.

First, Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that will explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles will explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle exploding.

However, without additional information, we can only calculate the number of candles that will explode, which is 500. If we assume the defects are independent, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode would be:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 5\% \times 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

First, we calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price (100% - 30% = 70%).

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days, which is 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days:
\[ 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"To find the size of Timothy's locker, we can work through the relationships given step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet, landing on a ledge at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

3,000 feet"
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.

First, the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the costs into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years total 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{256}
\]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the jogger jeans. The problem states that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we need to find out the total amount Cole saved. The problem states that he saved a total of $6. Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we can set up the following equations:
\[ \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
\[ \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price. Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is:
\[ x - 22 = 2 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the sale price is the same as the original price since no savings are mentioned for the tattered jeans. Therefore, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   \[
   4 \text{ buses} \times 60 \text{ employees/bus} = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   \[
   6 \text{ minibusses} \times 30 \text{ employees/minibus} = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   \[
   10 \text{ minivans} \times 15 \text{ employees/minivan} = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Now, we add the capacities together to find the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[
240 \text{ employees} + 180 \text{ employees} + 150 \text{ employees} = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"First, let's determine the number of birds attracted by each type of bird feeder.

- Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds.
- Each bird feeder Lillian made attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each homemade bird feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds.

Lillian has 3 homemade bird feeders and 3 store-bought bird feeders. We can now calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder.

- Total birds attracted by homemade feeders: \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- Total birds attracted by store-bought feeders: \(3 \times 20 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

\[90 + 60 = 150\]

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the bagel**: The bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the original price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the soup} = 4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Cost of the cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Determine the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"First, let's determine the number of letters in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so we add 4 to 3:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of letters in both names. We add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
Amount needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"First, let's determine how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, and Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons, we calculate:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Next, we find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Now, we need to determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so:

\[ \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money George had left after his purchases. Since he had 1% of his money left after spending $5, we can calculate the amount of money he had left as follows:

\[ \text{Money left} = 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

This means George spent:

\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:

\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much he spent on candy bars:

\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars he bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:

\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many lollipops each of his four friends received. Since the 20 lollipops were shared equally among his four friends, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, which means 2 pieces are eaten. Since the cake was divided equally, each piece weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, the weight of the 2 pieces eaten is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake is:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, we need to determine the time it takes for Bernadette to be driven to the theater. Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time to account for the additional 12 minutes (16 minutes - 4 minutes) of travel time.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

\[

"First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of blue} + 4 \text{ packs of red} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other:

\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know that Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the length of Movie A is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs loose in the cupboard.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, the number of glasses she can make is:

\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. Therefore, the number of trays she can put out is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker:
\[ \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\$576}{48} = \$12 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday:
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

The salesman sold the remaining sneakers to the department store. The number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]
The revenue from selling these sneakers is:
\[ 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

The total revenue from all sales is:
\[ \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

The total cost of the sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

The salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"

Therefore, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is:

\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of the regular ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.
   - We can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   21 - 15 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   6 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 6 - 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."

"First, let's determine how many sapphires Jenna has after the trade:
- Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.
- She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
- After the trade, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires.

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires and rubies:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- Each ruby is worth $1200.
- The value of the 5 sapphires is \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.
- The value of the 2 rubies is \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
2. Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
3. Add the two amounts together.

Marin eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Nancy eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Adding the apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of potting soil are required. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, and there are 15 red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)
                      = 15 + (0.60 * 15)
                      = 15 + 9
                      = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
                       = 15 + 24
                       = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
                      = 15 + 24 + 39
                      = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.

So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

**45**"
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip):
\[
\frac{4490}{2250} \approx 2.0044
\]
Rounding up, we get 3 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since a negative position doesn't make sense in this context, we interpret this as moving from 1st to 6th place (since she can't be in a negative position, we assume she moved to the 6th place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(6 + 2 = 8\). So, she is now in 8th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(8 - 3 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(5 + 1 = 6\). So, she is now in 6th place.

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"First, let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

1. Calculate the total number of employees:
   - There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
   - Total employees = 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

2. Calculate the total number of tour guides:
   - Each group has 7 tour guides.
   - Total tour guides = 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

3. Calculate the total number of people:
   - Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides
   - Total people = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

The total number of people going on this tour is 621."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel during the busy weekend.

The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend, we calculate the increased cost as follows:

\[ \text{Increased cost per day} = 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ \text{Total hotel cost} = 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each ticket costs $5000 and they are buying two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:

\[ \text{Total plane ticket cost} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

\[ \text{Total trip cost} = 5400 + 10000 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"First, let's determine how many tubes of blue paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, and Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint, Jasper has:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Next, let's determine how many tubes of yellow paint Jasper has. Since Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, and Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint, Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

Now, we add the number of blue and yellow paint tubes that Jasper has to find the total number of paint tubes Jasper has:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, the total number of paint tubes Jasper has is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

The combined weight of the two pennies is:

\[
48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}

"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned so far: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total earned from the goal to find out how much more they need:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"First, let's determine how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can store up to 100 songs:

- Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
- Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate. Since he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he made a bet to give up $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find the cost of Jillian's handbag, we start by identifying the cost of her shoes, which is given as $80. The problem states that the handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We can express this relationship with the following calculation:

1. Calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

2. Subtract $20 from this amount to find the cost of the handbag:
   \[
   240 - 20 = 220
   \]

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \(\boxed{220}\)."

First, we calculate the total miles James runs in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption for five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - The number of bags required is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we calculate the number of Pomeranians Jana has. Since two thirds of Jana's 27 puppies are Pomeranians, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, so we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to sum the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, we sum these temperatures:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30
\]

Next, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10
\]

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is \(-10\) degrees Fahrenheit."

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"To determine how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays.
2. Subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has.

First, we calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs and Jaime has 2 trays, the total capacity is:
\[ 24 \text{ eggs/tray} \times 2 \text{ trays} = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed from the total number of eggs Jaime has:
\[ 64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is:

"To determine the cost per razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid.

Given:
- 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall.
- The 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall.

The shortest cheerleader is 60"" tall.

In the human pyramid, the shortest cheerleader is at the top, so the height of the pyramid is the height of the shortest cheerleader.

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[ \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. Therefore, each day she walks:

"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"To find the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we first need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then sum these amounts.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn. The amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

To find the total amount of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma, we add the two amounts together:

"First, let's determine the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, 6 pieces will provide:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the snowshoes is:

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags that Tara bought.

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ canvas bags} \]

Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. Tara sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, the fight lasts 5 rounds of 3 minutes each, so the total number of minutes is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Joe throws 25 punches per minute, so the total number of punches he throws in 15 minutes is:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{375} \]"
"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Suzanne's cookies} = 36
   \]

2. Next, we are told that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made:
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

3. Finally, we are told that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies that Josh made:
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount is calculated as follows:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert Rob's time into minutes. Since Rob takes 2 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes to shingle a house.

According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double Rob's time and then add 40 minutes to it.

Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

280"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the number of skeins required for one set of winter wear and then multiply by the number of grandchildren.

For one set of winter wear:
- Hat: 2 skeins

"First, let's determine the picking rate for each person:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we add up the picking rates of all four individuals to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum these values.

First, we calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

Next, we calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9.

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. Assuming she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her weekly consumption is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, let's calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her additional daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her new daily consumption is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost of her new weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. According to the problem, Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then the number of chairs she has is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. The problem states that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom bought a CD for $4 and the total amount he paid was $48. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of CD} \]
\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{\text{Cost of headphone set}}{\text{Cost of one CD}} \]
\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 hours or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"First, let's determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we need to find out how old Jame will be in 8 years. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\).

Now, we need to find out how old Jame's cousin is currently. Since in 8 years Jame's cousin will be 55, his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

Finally, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin. The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost and the individual costs of the computer and the printer. We can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

Anne is 8 years old."
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is given as 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is given as 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to complete her monthly goal, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - Tip amount = 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.
   - Total bill including tip = $50 + $10 = $60.

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:

"To solve this problem, we need to break down the month of April into two halves and determine the daily savings for each half.

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

9. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

   - Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's sorted play set.
2. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

First, we know that James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. 

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's daily earnings.
2. Calculate John's weekly earnings.
3. Determine how many weeks are needed to save $80.

**Step 1: Calculate John's daily earnings.**
John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day.
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate John's weekly earnings.**
John works 4 days a week.

"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. Calculate the number of buttons with four holes.
2. Calculate the total number of holes from both types of buttons.

First, we know that there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes. Therefore, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 2 holes:
\[ 7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes per button} = 14 \text{ holes} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 4 holes:
\[ 14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes per button} = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 \text{ holes} + 56 \text{ holes} = 70 \text{ holes} \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"First, let's determine how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. The daily recommended amount is 4 cups, and Octavia drinks half of that:

\[ \text{Octavia's daily coffee intake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate Juan's current daily coffee intake. Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's current daily coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended amount from his current intake:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"First, let's determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is \(12 - 4 = 8\) years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the first son needs 12 candles and the second son needs 8 candles. Therefore, the total number of candles needed is \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Each pack contains 5 candles, so we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\). This means James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \( x \). According to the problem, \( x = 20 \).

The steps given in the problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Take the starting value \( x \) and add half of it: \( x + \frac{x}{2} \).
2. Divide the result by 5: \( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \).
3. Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: \( \left( \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} \right) \times (x - 12) \).

Now, let's substitute \( x = 20 \) into the expression and simplify step by step.

1. Calculate \( x + \frac{x}{2} \):
   \[
   20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the total time into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the total time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate how much 30% of Herb's house price is, and then subtract that from Herb's house price.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

2. Subtract that amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"First, let's determine the number of cups and dishes Judy brought to the event.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.
She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Next, let's find out how many cups and dishes her friend brought.

Her friend brought 40 cups.
Her friend also brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought = Judy's cups + Friend's cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\)
Total dishes brought = Judy's dishes + Friend's dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils brought by the two is the sum of the total cups and total dishes:
\[52 + 68 = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

John earned $40 more than Jill.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
$40"
"First, calculate the total calories burned from aerobics and running:

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Total calories burned: \(1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\)

Next, calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned:

- Water needed: \(\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\)

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to determine all three speeds:

1. The initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
2. After the lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
3. If he increases his typing speed by 5 WPM once more, his new speed will be \(52 + 5 = 57\) WPM.

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we sum the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight change per week for each breakfast option.
2. Multiply the weekly weight change by 5 to find the total weight change over 5 weeks for each option.
3. Find the difference between the two total weight changes.

**Step 1: Weekly weight change**
- Eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week
- Eating Donuts: +1.75 pounds/week

**Step 2: Total weight change over 5 weeks**
- Eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
- Eating Donuts: +1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = +8.75 pounds

**Step 3: Difference in weight change**
- Difference: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds = 15 pounds

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{316}\) seats."
"Let's calculate the weight of each dog step by step.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake.
3. Calculate the weekly protein intake.

Step 1: The protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so the daily protein intake is:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \]

Step 3: To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already put down a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \).

George makes \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"First, let's convert all Colby's coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs a nickel.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 8 quarters = \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime = 2 nickels, 6 dimes = \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels = 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel = 5 pennies, 15 pennies = \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts originally cost $35 with no discount mentioned, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost before tax:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50 and the total cost is $52.50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he cannot make the purchase with the given budget.

However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the problem setup, we can still calculate how much more money he would need:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks how much money Joe will have left, and he cannot make the purchase, the answer is that he will have:
\[ \boxed{0} \]
Joe will have no money left and will be short by $2.50."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of butter Juan will need is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

3. Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - However, the problem states that the cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\)
   - Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\)
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\)

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
2. Calculate the total amount of water used per year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used per week.**
Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water.
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used per year.**
There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[ 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used per year.**
The cost of one gallon of water is $0.15.
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

First, the total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Next, Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}

"To calculate the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in that week, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum the results.

1. **Cars towed in the first three days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Cars towed in the remaining four days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[
\text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

So, 25 riders can stay upright.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 25 riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[

   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"
"To find out how many fish Tommy caught, we need to follow the information given step by step.

   \text{Number of fish Tommy caught} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first need to calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by the total cost divided by the number of classes attended:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Next, we distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Then, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Finally, we divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole Bob wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to the new monthly salary:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21000 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$20000\right) = \$21000 + \$10000 = \$31000 \]

Now, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with the bonus by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$31000 \times 12 = \$372000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$372000\) in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = \( 10 \times 750 = 7500 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for dress pants = \( 10 \times 150 = 1500 \) dollars.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = \( 30 \times 60 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Sum of the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   - Total cost = \( 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[
\boxed{10800}

"To find the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we first calculate the distance each person biked individually and then sum these distances.

For Alisa:
- Speed: 12 miles per hour
- Time: 4.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

For Stanley:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
79 miles"
"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay separately, and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half his soil digging rate through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Finally, we sum the time required for both the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the number of cupcakes each person will get.

   \[
   1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people}
   \]

2. Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
   \[
   27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
   \]

So, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes at that time is:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she received 20000 more new likes. Therefore, the total number of likes now is:

"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2100}

"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account balance is $420 - $200 = $220. Since her weekly wage should be $300 and she only has $220 in her account, the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = \( 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \).

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = \( \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, let's break down the information given:

1. Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records.
2. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
3. Her first 8 days were good.
4. Her next 8 days were bad.
5. Her following 8 days were neutral.
6. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, let's account for the specific days mentioned:
- First 8 days were good, so 8 good days are already accounted for.
- The next 3 days are specified as good, neutral, and good, which means 2 more good days.

So, the total number of good days is:
- Initial good days (first 8 days) = 8
- Additional good days (next 3 days) = 2
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since the total number of good days recorded is 12, and we have already accounted for 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:

"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow an additional 360 inches, we divide the required growth by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**
20"

"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes by setting up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns} \times 96 \text{ potatoes}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} \]

\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]

\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]

\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

So, John and Jack have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"To find the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for apples is \(1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

2. **Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4\).

3. **Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is \(2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6\).

Now, we sum the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now that we know the age of one of the triplets, we can find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

\[180 - 80 = 100\]

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the candies. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so one candy costs:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, 10 candies will cost:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves each month. Since Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, we calculate Neil's monthly savings as follows:

\[ \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of coins Rong has saved:

\[ \text{Rong's total savings} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

And the total number of coins Neil has saved:

\[ \text{Neil's total savings} = 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine the number of each type of square:

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, the number of blue squares is:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, the number of green squares is:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, the number of white squares is:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12

"First, let's determine the capacity of Gordy's truck. Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 \]

Let's denote Gary's truck capacity by \( x \). So we have:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + x = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 8800 + x = 11600 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 8800 from both sides of the equation:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:

"First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

"First, let's calculate Dora's father's age. Given that Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age, we can express this as:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 \]

Substituting Dora's age (15) into the equation:

\[ \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Since Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father:

\[ \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34 \]

Now, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:

\[ \text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} \]
\[ \text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 \]

Next, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After this transaction, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube:

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"First, we determine how many students are in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]
So, each of the six groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:
\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]
This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

Now, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from the original 6 groups. Since 6 groups are already formed, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles as well (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.

Adding her earnings from both days:

- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total number of each type sold and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of vanilla scents sold:
- They sell 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- Total vanilla scents sold = \(5 \times 4 = 20\).

Next, calculate the total number of fruity scents sold:
- They sell 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- Total fruity scents sold = \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

Now, find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
- Difference = \(20 - 16 = 4\).

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants.

Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants.

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135:
\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \]

Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount needed by the number of ears of corn:
\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her activities over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time for soccer and video games is:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Tatiana plays video games for \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the remaining 9 hours:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

This means the time she spends playing soccer is the remaining time after accounting for reading and video games:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the total time available (12 hours) and the time spent on soccer (6 hours):

\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Anthony starts with 50 pencils.
2. He gives 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. So, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils}
   \]
3. Next, Anthony gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
   \]
   After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils}
   \]

So, the number of pencils Anthony kept is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"Let's define the variables for the number of enemies jumped on, berries collected, and seconds left on the timer for both Ava and Emma.

Let:
- \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Then, for Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the four pizzas.
2. Subtract the cost of the two pizzas that are already known.
3. Divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

Let's start with the total cost of the four pizzas, which is $64. The cost of two of the pizzas is $30. So, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:

\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:

\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \(W\). Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\), we get:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = 5 - 17\]

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[\boxed{4}\]"

First, the total cost of the trip is $300. The school will cover half of this cost:
\[ \text{School contribution} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

Next, we need to find out how much John still needs to raise. John has $50, and the school will contribute $150, so the total amount covered by John and the school is:
\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \]

The amount of money John still needs to raise is:
\[ 300 - 200 = 100 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John is missing is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. To prevent the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The temperature difference that needs to be compensated for is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees is:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. This is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total salary expense for all employees after three months.

**Step 1: Determine the number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:
\[ 200 \text{ employees} + 60 \text{ employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total salary expense for all employees after three months.**

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total salary expense for 260 employees for one month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since we are calculating the total amount of money paid after three months, and the salary is paid monthly, the total salary expense for three months is:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[ \boxed{3120000} \]"

\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Next, we determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[ \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210 \]

Finally, we find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:
\[ \$230 - \$210 = \$20 \]

So, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part of her schedule:

- She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
- Playing half an hour each day for 14 days means she plays \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the total hours for the second part of her schedule:

- She plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
- There are 7 days in a week, so she plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of her schedule:

- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

So, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. Calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Determine the difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Determine the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches Milo can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month from January to May, given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month.

Starting with 10 students at the beginning of January:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}

"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores:

John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

This means they used 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows was 35. After using 18 and dropping 3, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows left can be used to make 14 S'mores. These 14 S'mores need to be shared between John and DeSean. If they share the S'mores equally, each kid can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.

"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).
- The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces.

We can write the equation for the total amount of the salt scrub as:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can solve for \( z \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can substitute \( z = 5 - 2s \) back into the equation to check the values. However, we only need to find \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if we choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number, the equation will hold. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

"To determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First week production:**
   \[
   \text{First week production} = 8,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Second week production:**
   \[
   \text{Second week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{First week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third week production:**
   \[
   \text{Third week production} = 3 \times \text{First week production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total production for the first three weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total production for the first three weeks} = \text{First week production} + \text{Second week production} + \text{Third week production}
   \]
   \[
   = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total monthly production:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly production} = 50,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

6. **Fourth week production:**
   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = \text{Total monthly production} - \text{Total production for the first three weeks}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"First, let's determine how many clay dishes each person made based on the information given.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, we add up the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old laptop.
2. Determine the total amount of money Erika has, including her savings, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom.
3. Use the information that she still needs $50 to find out how much she already has.

First, the reduced price of the laptop is:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is the sum of the money in her purse, the money from her part-time job, and the money from her mom:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

We know that after adding this total amount to the $50 she still needs, she will have enough to buy the laptop. Therefore, the total amount of money she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

- From 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- From 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

So, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he can extract:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk he needs to produce is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows he needs is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs \(\$5600\)."

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons:
\[ 3 \text{ packs of water balloons} \times 3 \text{ dollars each} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars} + 9 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes

= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given information and categorize the students accordingly.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group requires and then see how many such groups can fit into the 2-hour concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Time available for groups = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Finally, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:
- Number of groups = 110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. So, the new amount of water is:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[
\boxed{14000}
\]"
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ customers} \times \$20 \text{ per customer} = \$800 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$800 = 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ \$800 - \$80 = \$720 \]

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ \$800 + \$720 = \$1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges.

She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges.

She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

Therefore, the number of oranges she remained with is \(12 - 9 = 3\).

Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"First, let's determine how many badges each person earns in a year.

- Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
  \[
  1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
  \]

- Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
  \[
  3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"First, let's calculate the total number of banana bread loaves Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. She baked for 5 hours, and she can bake 2 loaves per hour.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ loaves/hour} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of slices from these 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50 in dollars. To find the total amount raised, we multiply the number of slices by the price per slice.

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount raised is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"

Gretchen had a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

First, calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
- The initial number of burritos ordered is 600.
- The total number of burritos consumed is 520.
- Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(23\).

**Final Answer:**

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought, let's break down the information given:

1. The bag of potatoes weighed 5 pounds.
2. The bag of sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weighed \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
3. The bag of carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.

"First, let's calculate the total number of jello cups Greg needs. Since there will be 30 kids and each kid can have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups needed is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many three-ounce boxes of jello are required to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can find out how many 3-ounce boxes are needed by dividing the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each 3-ounce box of jello is on sale for $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

So, the seller will give back $500 in change. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$500 \]"
"First, we calculate the total amount Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we have:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the cost:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the question asks for the amount Keenan spends per week in a four-week month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, Keenan spends \(\boxed{40}\) dollars per week."

"First, let's determine the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we calculate:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate the number of outdoor plants as follows:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. To find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants from the total number of plants:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

The speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The cost of the salad is $6.
2. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it is $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, so the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the raise:

- Mark's old hourly wage: $10
- Raise per hour: $2

New hourly wage = Old hourly wage + Raise per hour
New hourly wage = $10 + $2 = $12

Next, let's calculate how many hours Mark works in a week:

- Hours per day: 8
- Days per week: 5

Total hours per week = Hours per day * Days per week
Total hours per week = 8 * 5 = 40

Now, let's calculate Mark's weekly earnings with the new hourly wage:

Weekly earnings = New hourly wage * Total hours per week
Weekly earnings = $12 * 40 = $480

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). However, the problem does not provide the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, but we can express \( L \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

Since the problem does not give us the exact value of \( J \), we can infer that the value of \( J \) must be such that \( L \) is a non-negative amount. The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we calculate Carl's weight as follows:

Martin's weight = 55 kg
Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg = 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg = 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg

Finally, we calculate Harry's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg = 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"First, we need to account for the 4 cookies that Susan's husband took. So, we subtract these from the total number of cookies:

\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies. 

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages each read over the two days:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages read by Daniel from the total pages read by Denise:

\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

**Final Answer:**
15"
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls or
- 8 child bowls

Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, we can see that the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. This means the pot has enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Now, let's calculate how much soup is left after the family has eaten their bowls:
- The family eats 4 bowls in total.
- The pot originally had enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

Since the family has already eaten 4 bowls, and the pot originally had enough for 4 adult bowls, there is no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen he bought.

1. The cost of one notebook is $1.50. Since William bought five notebooks, the total cost for the notebooks is:
   \[
   5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
   \]

2. The cost of one ballpen is $0.50. Since William bought one ballpen, the total cost for the ballpen is:
   \[
   1 \times 0.50 = 0.50
   \]

3. Adding the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together gives:
   \[
   7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, we calculate the amount of material needed for 20 small masks. Since Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one small mask by dividing 2 yards by 4:
\[ \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]
Now, we can find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks by multiplying the material needed for one small mask by 20:
\[ \text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of material needed for 8 large masks. Since Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, we can find out how much material is needed for one large mask by dividing 2.25 yards by 3:
\[ \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]
Now, we can find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks by multiplying the material needed for one large mask by 8:
\[ \text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total amount of material needed:
\[ \text{Total material} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total amount of material Jo needs is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- Deepa spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- Therefore, the average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27} = 8\).

The average price she paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the total hours in a day.

1. **Sleeping**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
2. **Working**: He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. **Walking the dog**: He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 10 \text{ (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ (working)} + 1 \text{ (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

There are 24 hours in a day. To find the free time, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \]

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."

Next, let's determine how many red shoe boxes Tim uses and how many are left:

- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes used is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3\).
- Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4, and the number of red shoe boxes left is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

"To solve this problem, let's first set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

The relationship given in the problem can be written as:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm: \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.

Adding 100 acres more: \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

\(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

Therefore, the two farms together have a total of 700 acres."
"First, let's determine how many packages Colby completes per hour. According to the problem, he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in that time.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

The profit is:

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

First, we know that each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}

"First, we determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water that will be emptied in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the calorie content for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

The final numerical answer is:
85000"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the numbers of each type of toy:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.

First, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria initially:
- Maria gave 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria had 1 balloon for herself: \(1\) balloon.

So, the total number of balloons given by Maria is:
\[8 + 1 = 9\]

Next, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
\[9 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group.

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed in total, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

   - The total distance spat by both is \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.
   - The average total distance spat is \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

The average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"First, let's calculate the total time Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning. This is a total of 17 hours.

Next, we need to determine the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional hours after that. The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours), the cost is 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost if Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay. The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"First, let's determine how much hay each sheep needs. According to the problem, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the overall amount of hay Nate needs:

\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we subtract the amount he wants to deposit in the bank:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 5 pencils:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The visit charge: $40
2. The labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours
3. The parts charge: $60

First, calculate the labor charge:
- Since the charge is $35 per hour, for 2.25 hours, the labor charge is \(35 \times 2.25 = 78.75\).

Next, add up all the charges:
- Visit charge: $40
- Labor charge: $78.75
- Parts charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $178.75."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Since he only sold 5 CDs, but the cost of 10 CDs was $90, the net amount he spent on the CDs he kept is:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

However, since he sold the CDs for more than he paid for them, the net amount he was out is actually the initial cost minus the money he got from selling the CDs:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

But since the question asks how much money he was out, and he ended up with more money than he spent, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$0} \]

In fact, he made a profit of $110, but the question asks for the money he was ""out,"" which in this context means the initial expenditure, so the answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5
Marcus's age = 26 - 5
Marcus's age = 21

Now, since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × Marcus's age
Leo's age = 2 × 21
Leo's age = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

- The paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side.

First, calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:

\[
1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Since each paper is printed on both sides, each sheet of paper contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2:

\[
\frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"First, let's calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes to match the rate at which Vince staples the reports:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"First, let's determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining by adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"First, let's determine the number of emails that are not work emails. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day, and 7 of these are work emails. So, the number of non-work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remainder (the non-work emails) are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. The number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

Finally, we need to determine how many of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. The problem states that one-third of the other emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"First, we determine Shawna's age. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate the age of Shawna's father, who is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. 

\[

"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the following relationship to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

According to the problem, Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey. Therefore, the number of corn chips Collins received is:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"First, we calculate the total cost of the tickets for travel. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, which cost $400 in total. 

50% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of episodes in the show. We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up all the times:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones.

The price of the first two phones is $600 each, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the number of boxes she gave away:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes to her mom} + 2 \text{ boxes to her sister} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the given boxes from the total to find out how many boxes she has left:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes she kept:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \text{ of the remaining boxes} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes to find out how many boxes she sold:
\[ 8 \text{ boxes} - 2 \text{ boxes} = 6 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, we calculate the total number of oranges she sold:
\[ 6 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Next, we need to determine how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books. He has already saved $14, so:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford his books.

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use over the 8 days.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She is outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces per day.
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
- Therefore, the number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. Therefore, his dad's current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. Therefore, his brother's current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"First, let's determine how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught each day.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we determine the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

First, let's find the total number of petunias needed:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, let's find the total number of sweet potato vines needed:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Next, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations to find the total soil used so far:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil they have is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"First, let's calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes:

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00:
\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

**Final Answer:**
6"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:
1. **Peeling Shrimp**: Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
2. **Sautéing Shrimp**: Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's calculate the time required for each task for 90 shrimp:
1. **Peeling 90 Shrimp**:
   - Since she peels 6 shrimp per minute, the time to peel 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing 90 Shrimp**:
   - Since she sautés 3 shrimp per minute, the time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks (peeling and sauturing) need to be done sequentially, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Let's denote the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet as \(D\).
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so \(D = 30\).

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"First, let's determine the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's find the total duration of their howls combined:

\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers.
2. Determine how much money Adam's mother gave him.
3. Determine how much money Adam's father gave him.
4. Calculate the total amount of money given by his parents.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total cost of the trousers is $30.
2. Adam's mother gave him $6.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. The total amount of money given by his parents is \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. The amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively. We are given the following information:

1. Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
2. Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From the online fund: $1500

Total from neighbors and online fund: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we need to determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The ""everyone else"" here refers to the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, which is $2000.

So, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2000 = $6000

However, we also need to consider the additional $200 that Walter's friend is going to donate. This does not affect the lawyer's contribution, which is based on the initial total of $2000.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

$6000

So, the final numerical answer is:

$6000"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. Since he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. Since he has 10 appointments and each takes 30 minutes, the total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtracting the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic gives us the time left for updating records:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of chocolate bars per box.

First, let's find the total number of boxes sold:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- Together, they sold \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

Next, we know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes in total, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

First, let's calculate the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- Therefore, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
- Therefore, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- Therefore, the total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can set up equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Peter is:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Martha is:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):

\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:

\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Now, calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. So, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, we can find the total number of sticks by adding the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]

"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns per hour in total from wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we need to determine how much money Janet wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"First, we calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased:

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she evenly distributed 72 pictures into 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 of the albums contain only selfies and 2 of the albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only selfies is:

\[ \text{Selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of pictures in the albums that contain only portraits is:

\[ \text{Portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ \text{Total portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \(x\). Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"First, let's determine the amount of ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. We know that:

- One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
- With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds of ore per day, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day. Over 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent across all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

89.8%"
"First, we need to determine the total number of seats already allocated for graduates and faculty. This is calculated as follows:

\[ 950 \text{ (seats for graduates)} + 300 \text{ (seats for faculty)} = 1250 \text{ seats} \]

Next, we subtract the allocated seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family:

\[ 6000 \text{ (total seats)} - 1250 \text{ (allocated seats)} = 4750 \text{ seats} \]

These 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates. Therefore, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"First, let's determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For one fabric piece:
\[ A = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

**Final Answer:**
47.25"
"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"To find the number of Spanish books, let's break down the information given:

1. Total number of books = 50
2. Half of them are written in English, so the number of English books = \(50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25\)
3. 10% of them are written in German, so the number of German books = \(50 \times 10\% = 50 \times 0.1 = 5\)

Now, to find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

Number of Spanish books = Total number of books - Number of English books - Number of German books
Number of Spanish books = \(50 - 25 - 5 = 20\)

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Bernice has already driven. According to the problem, Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days. However, the problem does not specify the distance she drove each day, so we assume she drove a total of 325 kilometers in those 4 days.

The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive \(\boxed{1630}\) kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear."
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed.**

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"First, we calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident. The insurance is 60% more than the normal cost of $120.

The increase in cost is calculated as:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost of the insurance is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets Greg uses in a year.
2. Determine how many loads of laundry are needed based on the machine's capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.**

- Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
- Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

**Step 2: Determine the number of loads needed.**

- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
- The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

**Step 3: Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year.**

- Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the cats in one day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's find out how much cat food is consumed in one day. Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by one cat in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."
"First, let's determine how many slices each person ate based on the information given.

1. Becky ate 10 slices.

3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate and how many are left from their order.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate and how many are left from their order.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas eaten} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team to find the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:

"First, let's calculate the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}

"First, let's calculate the total number of guests Kayla invited:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Let's start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount of money. Let's denote Maggie's original amount of money as \( M \). We can write the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's determine Riza's original amount of money. Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount of money. Let's denote Riza's original amount of money as \( R \). We can write the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's determine the total number of bananas each monkey eats in a week.

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day. In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
- Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\). Therefore, in a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey:
\[70 + 98 + 7x = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7} = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, he completed an additional 500 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can find the cost of one rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 15 roses:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"Let's break down the timeline step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes after the first train arrives, which is 40 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves after 45 minutes (40 minutes to arrive + 5 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (60 minutes from the start).
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it leaves at 60 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (80 minutes from the start).
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes). The fourth train arrives at 80 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and he bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800.

The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
```
72000

"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Since Binkie's score was 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

Twice Binkie's score: \(2 \times 90 = 180\)

Frankie's score: \(180 + 15 = 195\)

Frankie's score was 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took him 1 hour to reach the point where he realized he forgot something. 

\[
\text{Answer: } 1 \text{ hour}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.

Total bananas from bunches = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

If Jenny were to buy these bananas individually, at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:

Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Since she bought the bananas in bunches for $3.00 per bunch, the total cost for 10 bunches is:

Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money she saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas:

Money saved = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first determine the growth rate per year. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, so the annual growth rate is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"First, let's determine the number of each type of bike sold:

1. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

2. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

3. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
   \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from each type of bike:

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
   \]

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times \left(\frac{500}{2}\right) = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
   \]

Finally, we sum up the earnings from all types of bikes to find the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of hay bales per hour:**
   - Each hour, the farmer produces 5 bales, but the truck removes 3 bales.
   - Therefore, the net increase in the number of hay bales in the field per hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Since the net increase is 2 bales per hour, over 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the initial number of bales in the field, we assume the field starts with 0 bales.
   - After 6 hours, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time spent in classes from Monday to Friday. Now, let's calculate the time spent on extra learning on Saturday and Sunday.

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of these days.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time.

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height after the first bounce.
3. Determine the height after the second bounce.

First, the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Next, the ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, the ball bounces again to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Let's break down the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}\]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:
   \[72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}\]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:
   \[74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}\]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:
   \[69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}\]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. Therefore, the number of bags sold is:
\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. Therefore, the total earnings are:
\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"First, let's determine the initial state of the sodas:
- Total sodas: 12
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 3 = 9

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, we need to find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. There are 2 shaken sodas left out of a total of 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:

\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry. However, the problem does not provide the number of people in each car or bus that actually attended the ceremony. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only calculate the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported by the vehicles, but we cannot definitively state the number of people inside the church without additional information.

Given:
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- There were 12 buses.
- There were 20 cars.

First, calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Since the problem does not specify how many of these people actually attended the ceremony, the final numerical answer based on the given information is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Therefore, we can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

2 minutes"
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, we can now calculate the total time spent over 5 days:

- \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}\).

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

- \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. 

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance}) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Set of Towels Purchase:**
   The set of towels was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Total New Purchases:**
   Add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."
"To determine Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris. Therefore, Ben's age is:
   \[
   \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
3. Caroline is three times older than Ben. Therefore, Caroline's age is:
   \[
   \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

Thus, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount based on her current savings rate.

1. **Calculate the annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement."
"First, we need to determine the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Each of these 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the total population of the school, we start by noting that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school by \( P \).

We can set up the following equation based on the given information:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We can calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days in June.
2. Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.
3. Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.
4. Determine the difference between the miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time and the miles she plans to hike per day.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in June.**
June has 30 days.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike.**
Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day.**
Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

**Step 4: Determine the difference between the miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time and the miles she plans to hike per day.**
To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike, we need to calculate the required miles per day to hike 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples bought is 12 kg. If Pierre and Paul take 7 kg, then the amount left for Jacques (and any other person, like James, if we assume James is Jacques) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

Therefore, the temperature in the morning was \(-3\) degrees Celsius."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we calculate the total amount of money Raymond has after saving from his allowance:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, the final amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine how much money Anna spent in total. She started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the total amount spent is:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, we know that Anna had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost Anna $5. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Adding this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the light blinks. The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We can find the rate of blinking by dividing the number of blinks by the number of minutes:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the initial number of male and female guppies and goldfishes in Tate's garden pond:

- Initial male guppies: 4
- Initial female guppies: 7
- Initial male goldfishes: 3
- Initial female goldfishes: 5

Next, we add the new fish Tate buys:

- New male guppies: 2
- New female guppies: 1
- New male goldfishes: 2
- New female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes after the purchase:

- Total male guppies: 4 (initial) + 2 (new) = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 (initial) + 1 (new) = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 (initial) + 2 (new) = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 (initial) + 3 (new) = 8

Now, we find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we calculate how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"First, let's determine the time each person spent on their chores:

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total production of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the total production of all five workers is:
\[400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}\]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

So, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"First, let's calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, which is 60 pounds.

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had must be half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[
\boxed{64}

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance, given that he flies 400 kilometers every day.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, given that he flies 400 kilometers per day. We do this by dividing the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use the speed of the 2nd fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's define the number of eggs painted by each person with variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Madeline painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.
- Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{96}\) dollars."
"First, let's determine how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary. Valerie earns $5000 and her brother earns $10000, so together they earn:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we find the total amount of money they all have together by adding Valerie's salary, her brother's salary, and their mother's salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking, which includes the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks.

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week.

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks and then add these to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **700**."
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost per single bagel by dividing the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This can be simplified to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of passengers:

\[ \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 84 \]

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). Therefore, we have:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

Next, we need to account for the 20 women who alight from the bus at the next stop. The number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, let's denote the probability of winning for the first ticket as \( P_1 \). According to the problem, \( P_1 = 20\% = 0.20 \).

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is:
\[ P_2 = 3 \times P_1 = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning each ticket:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

- Total number of octuplets = 8
- Number dressed in purple = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
- Number dressed in blue = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we calculate how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows:
- Number of blue-wearers wearing bows = \(2 \times \frac{1}{1} = 2\) (since all blue-wearers wear bows)
- Number of purple-wearers wearing bows = \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\)

Now, we find the total number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Total number of bow-wearers = \(2 + 2 = 4\)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Cole hid in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, we determine how many eggs each person found:
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, we calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the eggs found by each person:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

"First, let's calculate how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia gave him \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100.

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we need to add this amount to the $100 Jack originally had.

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has $120. 

\[
\boxed{120}

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's determine how much money Rissa was given. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \( x \). After giving \( x \) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( 15 - x \) dollars. According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original money. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left. Initially, Ronnie had $5, and he gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and that half the mural is yellow, we can determine that 6 pints of the paint are yellow (since \(12 \div 2 = 6\)).

The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. The total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3:

\[6 \div 3 = 2\]

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is given as 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:
\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"To find the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of it on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the number of days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\). We start with \(C_0 = 2.75\) inches.

- After the first day, \(C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
- After the second day, \(C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
- After the third day, \(C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
- After the fourth day, \(C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
- After the fifth day, \(C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since \(C_5 = 0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of girls on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of boys on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, we can find the total number of students on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys on varsity:

\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

Step 1: The dentist drills 4 teeth.
Step 2: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Therefore, the number of teeth capped is \(4 + 7 = 11\).
Step 3: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
Step 4: The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk was sour, we calculate:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk. Therefore, we calculate the refund as follows:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the net gain of snowballs per 15 minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time needed to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert the time into hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old when Digimon came out.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, this means they needed to order more bandages to cover the deficit. They ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. The deficit is 16 bandages, so they ordered 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional amount for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Add the additional amount for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To find out how many pens Alain has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Determine the number of red pens:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

2. Determine the number of black pens:
   - Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

3. Calculate the total number of pens:
   - The total number of pens is the sum of the red pens and the black pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens is \(25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac. Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
\[50 + 90 = 140\]

**Final Answer: 140**"
"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining step by step:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining root beer is 8 gallons, which will be shared equally among the 3 people. Therefore, each person will get:
\[
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
```
19

"First, let's determine the height of Mattison's two-story house. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find the height of the first floor to the ceiling. This height is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let's denote the height of the second floor as \( h \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

To find \( h \), we solve the equation:

\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. This leaves:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells for the other two teams to find.

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. This leaves:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells for team Gogetters.

Therefore, team Gogetters found:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by mortgaging his home. The house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount after paying off the debts.

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights of the tunas are as follows:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

First, let's find the selling price. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72. So, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]
To perform the multiplication, we can simplify it as follows:
\[
72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"First, let's determine the capacity of each class in John's school. Since each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest on the $300 he borrowed.

The interest is calculated as:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen needs to pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he needs to return minus the amount he has already paid:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after the increase. The original cost of one visit is $2. An increase of 150% means the cost is increased by 150% of $2.

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]

So, the new cost of one visit is:

\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of visits Pauline made over the 8 years. She visits the museum 3 times a year, so in 5 years, she made:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]

In the next 3 years, she also made 3 visits each year, so she made:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]

Adding these together, the total number of visits is:

\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

Since each visit now costs $5, the total amount spent is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost Karen would pay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
3. Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.**

- The original cost of a manicure is $35.
- The original cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The discount offered is 20%.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]

So, the discounted cost of the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]

So, the discounted cost of the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

The total cost for both the manicure and pedicure after the discount is:
\[ 28 + 32 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.**

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- A manicure involves 10 nails, and a pedicure involves 10 nails.

The total number of nails for both the manicure and pedicure is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

The total cost for the nail art is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

**Step 3: Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.**

"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, let's break down the information given:

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each.
2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
3. Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

First, calculate the total number of issues from the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, calculate the number of issues from the magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

Then, calculate the number of issues from the last magazine, which sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, add up all the issues from each magazine to find the total number of magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since the question asks for the number of magazines she gets every year, and we have calculated the total number of issues, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To find out how many paintings Kim has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many paintings Shelley has.
2. Use the information about Shelley to find out how many paintings Kim has.

First, we know that Samantha has 27 paintings and that she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has:
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:
\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Thus, the number of paintings Kim has is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie earns from the 4 standard 1-hour lessons. His standard rate is $80 per hour, so for 4 lessons:

\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is 75% of the standard rate:

\[ 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Charlie gives 2 1-hour lessons at this reduced rate, so the total for these lessons is:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:

\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[ \boxed{440} \]"

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day (assuming he doesn't stop at all, which is not realistic but we'll use this for calculation purposes), the distance he travels in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} = 1200 \text{ km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"First, let's calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used to make the grape juice. Since he used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, and Madeline ate 6 grapes, we have:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many grapes were left after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes. Initially, the total number of grapes can be represented as \( G \). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes used for the pies is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the remaining grapes were all used for the pies, we can set up the following equation:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 48 + 36 \]
\[ G = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82

"First, let's determine the capacity of each shelf:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:

- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"First, let's calculate the discounted price of one bag of beef jerky. The original price is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. Since one bag contains 30 sticks and the discounted price is $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total.

Next, we calculate how many questions she got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum up the results.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are 4 people in the family, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - There are 8 rooms, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Adding the flashlights for the people and the rooms together, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms, and half of them have 4 small candles each. So, the number of rooms with small candles is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of small candles is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. So, the number of rooms with medium candles is also \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Adding the small and medium candles together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**
   - The total number of candles and flashlights is the sum of the flashlights and the candles, which is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

"To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Tim spends at work answering phones each day.
2. Determine how many calls he can handle in that time.
3. Multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week.

First, we know that Tim spends 6 hours each day at work. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the hours to minutes:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we know that it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call. So, the number of calls he can handle each day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Since Tim works 5 days a week, the total number of calls he deals with in a week is:

"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will need to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To determine the cost for Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs.

"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. Therefore, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are 4 additional phones. The cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To determine how much money Derrick makes in June by selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

June has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.**

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June by selling all the doughnuts is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade has taken: 210 photos.
2. Determine how many photos Jade uploads in one day. Since she uploads 6 batches each day and each batch contains 7 photos, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
   \[
   6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day}
   \]
3. Calculate the number of days required to upload all 210 photos. This is done by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
   \[
   \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
   \]

Therefore, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for one week and then multiply it by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one week:
- Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair of pants} = \$16.00\)
- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, add these amounts together to get the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for 5 weeks:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
\[50 + 20 = 70\]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
\[2 \times 70 = 140\]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
\[60 \times 4 = 240\]

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480\]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[480\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we need to account for the kernels that pop from the residual heat after the pan is taken off the heat. This is a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels} \]

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs to make 5 gallons of lemonade in total (4 gallons for the party + 1 gallon for Allen).

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, he will need \(5 \times 1 = 5\) cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The tower is made out of 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).
4. The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of blocks:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. Therefore, the number of seeds in a large sunflower is:
\[ 36 + (0.5 \times 36) = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"First, we determine how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Next, we find out how many pens Sarah has. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. 

\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's determine Anne's height. Since Albert is 36"" tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne's height is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72"" \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne. Therefore, Jackie's current height is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70"" \]

Jackie grew 3"" over the summer. To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we subtract the 3"" she grew from her current height:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67"" \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day.
2. Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars produced in two weeks.

Step 1: The company produces 5000 bars per day.

Step 2: There are 14 days in two weeks. So, the number of bars produced in two weeks is:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Step 3: The company sells each bar for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is:

"To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from his allowance over 3 weeks.

Ryan earns $6 each week, so over 3 weeks, he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Since there are 4 people in total and each ice cream cone costs $1.25, the total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings, Ryan has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the costs of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate the total amount Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. So, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]
Therefore, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both of them:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many holes are filled and how many are left after each day Nate is home. Each day, Nate fills 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net change in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

We need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for all the table legs.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table needs:
\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

James is putting together 4 tables, so the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.**
- Number of nights the restaurant is open per week: 2
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the total amount made in a week is \(\$180\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given that the vendor made a profit of 25%. The profit percentage is calculated on the cost price, so the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

So, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (since there are 20 animals in total)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
