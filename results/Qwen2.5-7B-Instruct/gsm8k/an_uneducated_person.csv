"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day.

The number of eggs left to sell is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day at the farmers' market.

**$18**"
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

So, in total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts. 

**Final Answer: 3**"
"First, we need to calculate the new value of the house after the repairs. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%. 

The original value of the house was $80,000. A 150% increase means the value increased by 1.5 times the original value.

So, the increase in value is:
\[ 80,000 \times 1.5 = 120,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original value gives us the new value of the house:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Now, we need to calculate Josh's total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repair costs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ 70,000 \]"
"James runs 60 meters in each sprint. He does 3 sprints 3 times a week.

So, in one session, he runs:
60 meters/sprint × 3 sprints = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session × 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

**540 meters**"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of feed each chicken needs in a day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals a day, each chicken gets:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, if Wendi has 20 chickens, the total amount of feed needed for all the chickens in a day is:

\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:

\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:

\[ 140 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can pair them up to make the calculation easier. There will be 8 pairs of glasses.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is \(5 + 3 = $8\).

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\) sheep.

260"
"First, let's calculate how long it would normally take to download the file without any interruptions:

- The file size is 200 GB.
- Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.

Without any interruptions, the time to download the file would be:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's break down the process with the interruptions:

1. **First 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB} \).
   - Time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Restart due to Windows update:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download from the beginning:**
   - Now, Carla has to download the entire 200 GB again.

4. **Time to download the remaining 200 GB:**
   - Time to download 200 GB at 2 GB/minute is \( \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 100 \text{ minutes} \).

Adding all these times together:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ \boxed{160 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"First, let's calculate the distance John initially travels to the point he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

When he turns around, he is 180 miles away from home.

Next, we calculate the distance he covers on his way back home. He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time of 4 hours minus the 2 hours in traffic and the 0.5 hours already spent driving, which is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
At 80 mph, the distance he covers in 1.5 hours is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance he covers on his way back is:
\[ 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Since he was 180 miles away from home initially and has covered 135 miles on his way back, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"First, we calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, we calculate her overtime pay. She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.

\[ 1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Now, we calculate her earnings for the 5 hours of overtime.

\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week.

\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ 366 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost for each type of pastry:

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the pastries:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. So, the revenue from selling lemons each year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Cost**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

So, the net profit each year is:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}
\]

4. **Break-even Point**: We need to find the number of years \( n \) such that the total net profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of $90. The total net profit after \( n \) years is:
\[
7.5n \geq 90
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house, and she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

4. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

5. Add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

6. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[
2x = 36
\]

7. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

20 - 4 = 16 students

Next, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:

25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

These 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance. Now, we subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are enrolled in hip-hop dance:

16 - 4 = 12 students

To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and then multiply by 100:

(12 / 20) * 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5/100) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2/100) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values:
- Jewelry: $5,125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096

The electronic gadgets will yield a higher value at the end of the month. The profit from the electronic gadgets is the final value minus the initial value:
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Therefore, the profit the merchant would make by choosing the electronic gadgets is $96."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward. 

For the first day, the distance covered by each train is 80 miles.
For the second day, the distance covered by each train is 150 miles.

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The final numerical answer is:
230 miles"
"First, let's calculate Jill's earnings from teaching:

She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week as a teacher. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \times 35 = 700 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \times 50 = 35000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from being a cheerleading coach:

She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week as a coach. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \times 15 = 450 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \times 50 = 22500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add her annual earnings from both jobs to find her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 + 22500 = 57500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, her annual salary is:
\[ 57500 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many eggs Claire uses in a week. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week, she uses:

3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Now, let's calculate how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:

21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

7"
"First, let's calculate the total time Marissa has to complete the 12-mile trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that the total distance is 12 miles and the desired average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time required:
\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, the remaining time she has to walk the last 6 miles is:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula for speed:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we have:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume is 9 liters. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:

\[ \text{Water in remaining orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we have:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:

\[ \text{Total water} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Samantha is now 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to calculate the difference between Raymond's current age and the age he was when his son was born.

So, 25 (Raymond's current age) - 23 (age when Raymond had his son) = 2 years.

Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to 5 out of his 8 customers. 

- The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

Adding these together: 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts by 2 centimeters every hour, after 4 hours it will melt by:

2 centimeters/hour × 4 hours = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter."
"To find the original price of the book, we need to understand that the price Kyle paid ($19.50) is 75% of the original price (since he got a 25% discount).

Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that \( 75\% \) of \( P \) is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the boxes of pizza.

The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
The cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $3 = $15.
The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $6.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much she spent on the boxes of pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from $50:
$50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

Final answer: 2."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to travel. His second stop was 15 miles before the end, so he had 15 miles left to travel when he made his second stop. Therefore, the distance he traveled between his first and second stops is 40 - 15 = 25 miles.

Final numerical answer:
25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of the two pairs of high heels. We know that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much. So, the cost of the second pair of heels is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. This is the sum of the cost of the first pair and the second pair:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let's denote the cost of the boots by \( B \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 99 = 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"First, let's figure out their current ages. Since Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can say that Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

The total of their ages is given as 162, so we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find x, we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have x, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"First, let's find out how many jelly beans each friend guessed:

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, let's add these guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of guesses, which is 3.

240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can break it down into a few steps:

1. Calculate the daily care time for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends on this daily care over the course of a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, which is \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \).

So, \( 2S + 30 = 110 \).

Subtract 30 from both sides: \( 2S = 80 \).

Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 40 \).

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Therefore, the number of gold coins is \( 40 + 30 = 70 \).

Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of Raymond's jewels would be 40 / 2 = 20 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than this, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by Mike, we add the points from both halves of the game:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

Total points scored by Mike: 9."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Yogurts are sold at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ 60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets:

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells his lego sets for $15 each and has $5 left after buying 8 video games for $20 each.

First, let's calculate how much money John spent on the video games:
8 video games * $20 each = $160

Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we can find out how much money he had before buying the video games:
$160 (spent on video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Now, we know John sold his lego sets for a total of $165. To find out how many lego sets he sold, we divide the total amount of money by the price per lego set:
$165 / $15 per lego set = 11 lego sets

John originally had 13 lego sets and sold 11 of them, so the number of lego sets he still has is:
13 - 11 = 2 lego sets

Final numerical answer:
2"
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate his speed in miles per hour. First, let's break down the information given:

1. John runs a total of 60 miles a week.
2. He runs 3 days a week.
3. He runs 3 hours on the first day.
4. He runs half as much time on the other two days.

Let's calculate the time he runs on the other two days:
- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, so he runs for \(3 \div 2 = 1.5\) hours each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he runs in a week:
- Time on the first day: 3 hours
- Time on the second day: 1.5 hours
- Time on the third day: 1.5 hours
- Total time: \(3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6\) hours

Next, we need to find his speed. Speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Total distance: 60 miles
- Total time: 6 hours
- Speed: \(60 \div 6 = 10\) miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

10 miles per hour"
"First, let's determine Dana's running and walking speeds.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

So, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \div 4 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, let's calculate the time she spends running and walking in six hours.

Total time: 6 hours
- One-third of the time running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
- Two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

- Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
- Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s, then Ben’s iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s, Brandon’s iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

So, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pieces of apple pie were available at the beginning. Since Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many calories are in the whole 300g bag of chips. Since it has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories, the total calories in the bag are:

\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Now, you have already consumed 1800 calories out of your daily target of 2000 calories. This means you have:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

left for the day. Since each serving is 250 calories, you can have:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g, you can eat:

\[ 0.8 \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ g/serving} = 48 \text{ g} \]

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips."
"First, let's figure out how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, we can calculate the pounds of beeswax needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of beeswax needed} = \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the supplies. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, we can find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Net profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is:
\[ 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, let's find the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 104 \]"
"Candice started with 80 post-it notes. She used 220 post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. To find out how many post-it notes were in the package she bought, we need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she used and had, and then subtract the ones she started with.

So, the total number of post-it notes she used and had is 220 (used at work) + 23 (left over) = 243.

Now, subtract the ones she started with: 243 - 80 = 163.

The package she purchased contained 163 post-it notes."
"First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 4-foot long wire is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, if the wire is cut into pieces that are 6 inches long, we can find out how many pieces Tracy obtained by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is:

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Now, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is:

3/4 * 120 units = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"First, let's calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd has per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozen

Next, we calculate how much Lloyd makes per day by selling these dozens of eggs at $2 per dozen:

21 dozen * $2/dozen = $42 per day

Now, to find out how much Lloyd makes per week, we multiply his daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7):

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294 per week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week."
"To find out how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance he travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

First, we calculate the time Tom spends traveling from 1 to 4 PM:
- From 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.
- Since his ship travels at 10 miles per hour, the distance \(D\) he covers in 3 hours is:
  \[
  D = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Tom to travel back at 6 miles per hour:
- The distance back is the same, 30 miles.
- The time \(T\) it takes to travel back is given by the formula:
  \[
  T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
  \]

So, the time it takes Tom to get back is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by 1/2:

\[ 7.5 \div \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final answer:
\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's calculate the revenue for Thursday:

- For truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- For car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Next, let's calculate the revenue for Friday:

- For car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday: $480 (since no truck tires were repaired)

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue. Since Thursday's revenue is $520 and Friday's revenue is $480, Thursday had the higher revenue.

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:

$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens. Their mother's cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had more kittens.

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. So, Patchy has:
3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, adding all the kittens together:
Adopted kittens: 7
Patchy's kittens: 21
Trixie's kittens: 12

Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so she has:
30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the number of lollipops by 2:
28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

Jean can fill 14 bags."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate how much one trip to the movies costs and then see how many times he can afford it with his $42.

The cost of one trip to the movies is the sum of the ticket and the popcorn:
\[ \text{Cost per trip} = \$7 + \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times Peter can afford this with his $42:
\[ \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\$42}{\$14} = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times."
"To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry: 5000 pounds.
2. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. The remaining weight available for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds. The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is:

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00.

25% of $40.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the 25% fee is $10.00.

Next, we add the $3.00 delivery fee and the $4.00 tip to the original bill and the 25% fee.

The total additional fees are:
\[ 10 + 3 + 4 = 17 \]

Now, we add these additional fees to the original bill of $40.00:
\[ 40 + 17 = 57 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is:

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

So, the total number of raspberries is 187."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Sour oranges: 2

Now, let's add up the bad, unripe, and sour oranges:
1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
25 (total) - 8 (bad, unripe, and sour) = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17."
"First, we need to find the total cost of the material and the jeweler's work. Janet pays $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler, so the total cost is:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Now, we add the insurance cost to the original total cost to find the final amount Janet paid:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, the final amount Janet paid is:

"After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the pension value per year. The base pension is $50,000 per year. 

For the 21st to 30th year, she gets the base pension plus 5% of the base pension. 

5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
\[ 50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500 \]

So, her additional pension is $2,500 per year. 

Adding this to her base pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $52,500.

\[ \text{Annual Pension} = 52,500 \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount Aleena pays for the first half of the year. Since the streaming service charges $140 per month, for 6 months (half a year), the cost is:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less. So, we need to find 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \]

Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Since the second half of the year also consists of 6 months, the total cost for the second half is:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]

Now, we add the costs of the first half and the second half to get the total amount paid for the year:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the mpg, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:
\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know that her car can travel 25 miles for every gallon of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can travel on a full tank by multiplying the mpg by the tank capacity:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"First, let's figure out how much time Jim spends on TV and reading each time he does this activity.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half as long as he watches TV, which is:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, each time he does this, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ hours/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Over 4 weeks, he spends:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final answer is:

- There are 4 schools.
- Each school has 2 teams (girls' and boys').
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school also sends 1 coach for each team, so 2 coaches per school.

So, for players:
- 4 schools * 2 teams/school * 5 players/team = 40 players

For coaches:
- 4 schools * 2 coaches/school = 8 coaches

Adding players and coaches together:
- 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people

"First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

Next, we need to find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, let's find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times 4 \text{ dollars per slice} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:

5 cell phones * $150 each = $750

Now, we need to calculate the interest. The interest rate is 2% for each unit, so for 5 units, the total interest would be:

5 * $150 * 2% = $150 * 2% = $3 for each unit

So, the total interest for 5 units is:

5 * $3 = $15

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones:

$750 (total cost) + $15 (total interest) = $765

Shiela is paying this amount in 3 months with equal monthly payments. So, we divide the total amount by 3:

$765 / 3 = $255

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.

Given:
- The top level (4th level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **4th level (top level):** 16 square feet
2. **3rd level:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **2nd level:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **1st level (bottom level):** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ 7.5 \]"
"Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. 

To find out how many cups of dog food she uses in the first year, we need to know how many days are in a year. A year typically has 365 days.

So, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
365 - 180 = 185 days

For the first 180 days, she uses:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, she uses:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

Adding these together gives the total amount of dog food used in the first year:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food she will use. Each bag contains 110 cups.

So, the number of bags needed is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"First, let's figure out how much laundry each person does based on the information given.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"First, let's figure out the cost per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50:
- Cost per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 (repeating)

For the package of 2 flowers for $1:
- Cost per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50

Since $0.50 is less than $0.8333, the package of 2 flowers for $1 is the better price.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 18 flowers using the better price.

- Number of packages of 2 flowers needed for 18 flowers = 18 / 2 = 9 packages
- Total cost for 18 flowers = 9 * $1 = $9

If Vincent were to buy the flowers at the other price:
- Number of packages of 3 flowers needed for 18 flowers = 18 / 3 = 6 packages
- Total cost for 18 flowers = 6 * $2.50 = $15

The money saved by buying at the better price is:
- Money saved = $15 - $9 = $6

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"First, we calculate the discount amount:
$100 * 30% = $100 * 0.30 = $30

Then, we subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost for the grooming is $70."
"First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters of water, we can calculate this as:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we need to add the amount of water the boy got, which is 6 liters:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of water given to the girls and the boy from the initial 24 liters to find out how much water is left:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water left is:

\[ 10 \text{ liters} \]"
"Let's calculate the total number of stickers Charlie had after each event:

1. Initially, Charlie had 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He received 23 stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's find out how much Alex weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds:

\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"First, we find the total number of roses by multiplying the number of rose bushes by the number of roses per bush:

3 rose bushes * 25 roses per bush = 75 roses

Next, we find the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

75 roses * 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Then the number of games they won is \( L + 8 \).

Since they played 22 games in total, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

The team won 15 games.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. After 5 years, her salary is increased by 10%. So, her salary after 5 years is:

\[ 600 + (600 \times 0.10) = 600 + 60 = 660 \]

This means her monthly salary after 5 years is $660. Now, she will get a 10% increase every year for the next three years.

After the first year (6 years total in the company):
\[ 660 + (660 \times 0.10) = 660 + 66 = 726 \]

After the second year (7 years total in the company):
\[ 726 + (726 \times 0.10) = 726 + 72.6 = 798.6 \]

After the third year (8 years total in the company):
\[ 798.6 + (798.6 \times 0.10) = 798.6 + 79.86 = 878.46 \]

So, her annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[ 878.46 \times 12 = 10,541.52 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 10541.52 \]"
"Let's say Harald's record sold \( x \) copies. Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, Marilyn's record sold \( 10x \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. So, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 10x = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11x = 88,000 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ x = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ x = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to find out how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the guests don't show up, that means 3/4 of the guests will attend.

Christina invited 16 friends, so the number of guests expected to show up is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of gift bags she needs. Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Christina will spend is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much potato salad the children will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, a child will eat 5 lbs of potato salad (10 lbs / 2).

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Next, we calculate the total amount needed for the children:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Finally, we add the amounts for adults and children to find the total:
200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic."
"Cindy has 4 pets.

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"First, we need to find out how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles. Since Lee now runs it in 38 seconds and used to be two seconds faster than Gerald, we can say that Gerald used to run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed has improved by 10%. This means he can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 90% of the time it used to take him. To find out how long that is, we calculate 90% of 40 seconds.

\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

36"
"First, let's find out how many cats there are. Since there are two cats for every dog and there are 60 dogs, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Next, we need to find the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand the volume loss**: When Freda cooks the canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. This means that the volume of the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking.

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking**: Since the sauce made is 32 ounces and it is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking must be \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. So, the number of cans used is \( \frac{64}{16} = 4 \) cans.

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the 30 minutes is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is the original number of cars minus the 5 that took an exit. This gives us:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, we have the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of plants she already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, Mary is giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. So, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Now, we need to find out how many potted plants Mary will have left after giving away 40 plants. She originally had 80 plants and is giving away 40 plants, so the number of plants she will have left is:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Mary also received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to the 40 plants she has left after giving some away, the total number of plants she will have is:

\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day."
"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which is 20 glasses of water.

"First, let's calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions (subtracting 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, let's calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the TV watching time for each day:

- **Monday**: 1 hour
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Friday**: 2 hours
- **Total known time**: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (known time) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes (0.5 hours), we can find the number of 30-minute episodes by dividing the total time spent on Wednesday by the length of each episode:
1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He then dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total, we need to calculate the number of fruit roll-ups each of them had.

First, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had:
- Beatrice's roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had:
- Marcell's roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups both of them had to find the total:
- Total number of fruit roll-ups = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two people):
- Average number of fruit roll-ups = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"First, let's figure out how many feet Julia needs to row to reach the shore. Since it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

"First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ 300 = 50 \times D \]

To find \( D \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 50:

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought ten of these at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She bought five of these at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has gone up by 50%, so the new price is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15 each.
- Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- The price has also gone up by 50%, so the new price is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24 each.
- Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts used are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined, we can find out how many teaspoons each part represents by dividing the total by the total number of parts:

120 teaspoons / 20 parts = 6 teaspoons per part

Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 6 teaspoons per part by 7 parts to find the total teaspoons of sugar:

6 teaspoons/part * 7 parts = 42 teaspoons

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. So, he buys a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $60. Therefore, the total cost for 6 pairs of shoes is \(6 \times 60 = 360\).

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

The total number of vehicles at the port the next day was 30.

To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles the next day: 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles.

Since each container has 5 vehicles, we divide the number of new vehicles by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"First, let's find out Lylah's salary four years ago. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, which was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \( L \).

Adrien's salary four years ago was 130% of Lylah's salary, so:
\[ 1.30L = 40,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = 30,769.23 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Now, let's calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from what it was four years ago. So, his new salary is:
\[ 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

Since Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage, her new salary is:
\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.92 \]

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Each pad has 30 sheets of paper.

So, in a week, he uses:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"First, let's figure out how many fruits Kael brought. 

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

So, Kael brought:
- \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's add up all the fruits:

Morisette's fruits:
- Apples: 5
- Oranges: 8
Total for Morisette: \(5 + 8 = 13\)

Kael's fruits:
- Apples: 10
- Oranges: 4
Total for Kael: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Adding both totals together:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

So, they have 27 fruits in total."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so:
8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.

For the rest of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday), she slept 1 hour more than 6 hours, so:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

Now, let's add up her sleep hours for the whole week:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 hours
- Thursday: 7 hours
- Friday: 7 hours

Total sleep hours = 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 34 hours.

So, Sadie slept a total of 34 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, so she covers:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

After that, she runs at 5 miles per hour. The total time is 7 hours, so the remaining time after the first 3 hours is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

In the remaining 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, so she covers:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles} \]

"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, she stamped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

These 20 letters are now in the pile of already-stamped letters. If there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, and 20 of them were just added, then there were \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) letters already in the pile when Jennie began.

So, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is 10.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the package Julia bought had \( x \) spoons.
2. Her husband gave her a package of 5 spoons.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she used 3 spoons from the total she had.
4. After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left.

So, the equation to represent the situation is:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought had 10 spoons.

Final answer:

"First, let's find out the cost of each item:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchase:

- For 4 watermelons: \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- For 20 peppers: \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- For 10 oranges: \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

\(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total time spent by doctors with patients in a day:

500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12000 minutes

Convert this time into hours:

12000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the revenue and cost for the hospital:

Revenue from patients:
200 hours * $200 per hour = $40,000

Cost to the hospital:
200 hours * $150 per hour = $30,000

Finally, calculate the profit:

Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000

The hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. So, the number of elves left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves left:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

So, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Joseph's expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.

"Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and the luge 2 times, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and the luge 2 times, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides. Together, they rode a total of 4 + 6 = 10 rides. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used is 10 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets.

60 tickets"
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday, which is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles.

To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage:

\(41 - 4 - 24 = 13\) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 

First, we find out how much he pays in a month:
4 car washes * $15 per car wash = $60 per month

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year:
$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"First, let's figure out how many video games Brian has right before the comparison. Brian originally has 20 video games but lost 5, so he has:

20 - 5 = 15 video games.

Now, we need to find out how many video games Bobby has. According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So we calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has and then subtract 5:

3 * 15 = 45

Now, subtract 5 from 45:

45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Final answer: Bobby has 40 video games."
"First, we need to find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. Since one third of the 27 unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the subs, bags of chips, and cookies.

- The cost of 2 subs at $7.50 each is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\).
- The cost of 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\).
- The cost of 2 cookies at $1.00 each is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\).

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the delivery fee and tip.

\[15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\]

Next, we need to calculate the 20% delivery fee on the total cost.

\[20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\]

Now, we add the delivery fee to the total cost before the tip.

\[20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total.

\[24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"Mark completed the first test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Since he had 8 hours to complete the first test, he could have answered \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions. However, the first test had 75 questions, so he left \(75 - 40 = 35\) questions incomplete.

For the second test, he had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate of 5 questions per hour. In 6 hours, he could answer \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions. Since the second test had 100 questions, he left \(100 - 30 = 70\) questions incomplete.

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests, Mark left \(35 + 70 = 105\) questions incomplete.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the number of pink gumballs, we start by defining the number of blue gumballs. According to the problem, there are 12 blue gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 4 \times (\text{Number of blue gumballs}) + 22 \]

Substituting the number of blue gumballs (12) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Now, we perform the multiplication and addition:

\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 48 + 22 \]
\[ \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70."
"First, we need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4 (semi-automatic cars)

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the number of queens be \( Q \).
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \).
3. Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

The total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 7Q \]

We know the total number of bees is 700:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week. Since he plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total hours spent playing video games in a week as follows:

2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

Now, since Jordan earns $10 an hour at his part-time job, we can calculate how much money he would earn if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games:

$10/hour * 14 hours = $140

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:
- Milk is a food item, so it costs $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so they cost $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so they cost $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so they cost $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so they cost $4.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4
Total cost of non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the non-food items:
Total cost of non-food items after tax = $10 + $1 = $11

Now, let's add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 = $5

Finally, we add the cost of the food items to the cost of the non-food items after tax:
Total cost of everything = $5 + $11 = $16

So, the final numerical answer is:
$16"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so:

\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths needed. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles of bleach per client} = 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \]
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack of cloths per client} = 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the bleach and cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cloths costs $5, so:

\[ 16 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} = \$32 \]
\[ 8 \text{ packs of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:

\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:

\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:

\[ \$20 \]"
"John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, with 100 pineapples per hectare. So, the total number of pineapples in his field is:

10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

So, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. 

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10.
The cost for 1 adult ticket is $12.

So, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost} = \text{Change} \]
\[ \text{Amount given} - 22 = 8 \]

To find the amount given, we add 22 to 8:
\[ \text{Amount given} = 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

To find Dorothy's friends, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, the number of Facebook friends James has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute
- Time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute
- Time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

The winner is Steve, and the loser is Tim. The difference in their times is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate the number of tires Shawnda inflated:

- For the 5 people on bicycles, each has 2 tires, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the 3 people on tricycles, each has 3 tires, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the 1 person on a unicycle, there is 1 tire, so that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

So, the final answer is:
\[5\] dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl has:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid with:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, Carl receives $4.00 in change."
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).
2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).
3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
5. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).
6. Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the remaining fries are \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on the days he has three 1-hour classes. He has these classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, which is 3 days a week.

Each of these days, he spends 3 hours in class. So, for these 3 days, he spends:
\[ 3 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of hours he spends in classes on the days he has two 2-hour classes. He has these classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which is 2 days a week.

Each of these days, he spends 4 hours in class (2 hours each class, and he has 2 classes). So, for these 2 days, he spends:
\[ 2 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's add the hours from both types of days to find the total number of hours he spends in class each week:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/week} + 8 \text{ hours/week} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:
\[ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[ 272 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

- Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
- Chocolate croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
- Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 2 feet = 24 inches) = 1440 inches

Now, let's add these lengths together to get the total length in inches:

1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for all the apes and then double it for 2 months.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas.

For 2 months, the total bananas needed = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back).

Blake's total distance:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. So, each round trip is 80 yards (40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back).

Kelly's total distance:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

Final answer:
\[ 280 \text{ yards} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the pens. Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so the total cost for the pens is:
4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks. He bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost for the notebooks is:
2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8

The cost of the rim of bond paper is $20.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find out how much Raphael spent in total:
Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper = Total cost
$6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out from under a lily pad, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so we subtract those 2 from the total. 

17 - 2 = 15

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday was 17 feet, the depth on Tuesday would be:

17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we calculate two thirds of 24 feet:

(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the total number of fish each person caught.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

So, Anakin's total is \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

So, Locsin's total is \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

Now, we add the totals of Anakin and Locsin to find the overall total:
\[19 + 13 = 32\]

The final numerical answer is:
32"
"To find the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step. The price increases by 20% every two months. 

First, let's find out how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

This means the price will increase 18 times. Each time the price increases by 20%, we multiply the current price by 1.20 (which is the same as adding 20% to the current price).

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. After each increase, the new price is the old price multiplied by 1.20. So, after 18 increases, the price will be:

\[ 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator:

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:

\[ 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final price is:

\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"First, let's figure out the cost of each type of toy.

We know that one red car costs $4. 

We also know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. If an action figure costs $5, then the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys.

- The cost of 5 red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

- The cost of 3 action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the amount of money Jackie will lose by doing her taxes herself instead of hiring an accountant. She will lose $35 for each hour of freelance work she doesn't do, and she'll lose 3 hours of work.

So, the total loss in income is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from this loss. The accountant charges $90.

So, the net loss in income if she does her taxes herself is:
\[ 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jackie will have:
\[ \boxed{15} \]
more dollars if she hires the accountant."
"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract that from her budget.

First, let's add up the costs of the items:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so no additional cost)
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the addition step by step:
1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €157 = €1404
3. €1404 + €74 = €1478
4. €1478 + €102 = €1580

The total cost of the items is €1580. However, Elvira's budget is only €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

So, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:
€1500 - €1580 = -€80

Final answer:
-€80"
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan. So, she needs:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( S + B = 24 \):
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is \(\boxed{16}\) years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Adding $2 to that, Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18.

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, for those 5 days, he walks:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the 2 weekend days, he walks:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekends gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"First, let's find the cost of each item:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
3. The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The average is calculated as \((25 + 75) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:

\[25 + 75 + 50 = 150\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is \(150\) dollars."
"To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs for each type of creature and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the legs from the spiders:
- There are 80 spiders.
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

Next, let's calculate the legs from the insects:
- There are 90 insects.
- Each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

Finally, let's calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
- Each has 10 legs.
- So, the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Now, we add the legs from all the creatures together:
- Total legs = legs from spiders + legs from insects + legs from rare mutant invertebrates
- Total legs = \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\).

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"First, let's figure out the ages of each bird:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = \(19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51\)

The total age of the four birds is 51."
"First, let's calculate how much Jessica wants to pay for each debt if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

For the student loans:
Minimum payment = $300
50% more = $300 * 1.5 = $450

For the credit card:
Minimum payment = $200
50% more = $200 * 1.5 = $300

For the mortgage:
Minimum payment = $500
50% more = $500 * 1.5 = $750

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total monthly payment:
Total monthly payment = $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500

To find the annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:
Annual payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel one potato. It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time to peel all the potatoes is:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut one potato. It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato. For 60 potatoes, the total time to cut all the potatoes is:

\[ 5 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 300 seconds to minutes:

\[ 300 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the potatoes and the time it takes to cut the potatoes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

\[ 95 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many glasses of lemonade they sold to make a $25 profit.

The cost to make one gallon of lemonade is $3 (lemons) + $2 (sugar) = $5.

The profit per gallon is the selling price per gallon minus the cost to make it. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0.50, the selling price per gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

The profit per gallon is then $10 (selling price) - $5 (cost) = $5.

To make a $25 profit, they must have sold $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.

The cost of lemons for 5 gallons is 5 * $3 = $15.

So, they spent $15 on lemons.

They spent $15 on lemons."
"First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know there were 240 Asians in total and 80 of them were Japanese. So, the number of Chinese is:

240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 (Chinese)

We are told that 60 of the Chinese were boys. To find out how many were girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese:

160 (Chinese) - 60 (boys) = 100 (girls)

So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team.

100"
"First, let's calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel.

Zaid's salary is $6000.

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \) dollars.
2. Car fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after these expenses.

Remaining amount after rent and car fuel: \( 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \) dollars.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

Donation to charity: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money is left after the donation.

Remaining amount after donation: \( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \) dollars.

Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700 for their expenses.

Total amount given to daughter and wife: \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations.

Remaining amount after giving to daughter and wife: \( 1250 - 900 = 350 \) dollars.

So, the final amount of money Zaid will still have is \( 350 \) dollars."
"First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has. Since Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, Monic has:

40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Now, Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani has:

36 + 10 = 46 crabs

To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each one has:

Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."
"The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. Since the total number of students who voted was 80, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).
2. According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. So, we can write:
   \[
   5W = 200
   \]
3. Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
4. The problem states that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses \( R \) is:
   \[
   R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"First, let's figure out Mark's age two years ago. We know Jan is currently 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old.

The problem states that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we calculate half of Jan's age two years ago:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Then, we add 5 years to this value to find Mark's age two years ago:

\[ 14 + 5 = 19 \]

So, two years ago, Mark was 19 years old. To find Mark's current age, we add 2 years:

\[ 19 + 2 = 21 \]

Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is currently 21 years old, we add 2 years to find Jean's age:

\[ 21 + 2 = 23 \]

So, Jean is 23 years old.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's calculate the total time for each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time = 55 seconds × 4 runners = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Total time = 60 seconds + 57 seconds + 54 seconds + 51 seconds = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
2 seconds"
"First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.

The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in their probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Final answer:
\[ 100\% \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much straw is used for the hamsters and the rabbits, and then use that information to find out how much straw is used for the rats.

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\).

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There is a pen of rabbits.
   - 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:**
   - Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = \(50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

4. **Straw used for rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for rats = \(160 \text{ pieces} - 70 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

5. **Rats:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \(r\) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = \(3 \text{ cages} \times r \text{ rats per cage} \times 6 \text{ pieces per rat} = 18r \text{ pieces}\).

6. **Setting up the equation:**
   - \(18r = 90\).

7. **Solving for \(r\):**
   - \(r = \frac{90}{18} = 5\).

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.

"To calculate how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we need to apply the interest for each month.

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict is $106.12.

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we add the cost of the tickets and the food to find the total cost for these items:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66.00 \]

Adding the cost of the rides to the cost of the tickets and food gives us the total amount spent:

\[ 36.00 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 102.00 \div 3 = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"

1. Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week for ten ducks.
2. Divide that amount by 7 to find out how much they need per day.

First, we know that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. So, for ten ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly amount by 7:
\[ 35 \text{ pounds/week} \div 7 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year. So, the net increase in trees per year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Number of flamingos taken back on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back.

3. **Number of pink flamingos left on Saturday morning:**
   - After taking back 6 pink flamingos, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).

4. **Number of white flamingos added on Saturday morning:**
   - The neighbors painted the 6 taken-back pink flamingos white and put them back.
   - So, there are now 6 white flamingos.

5. **Number of pink flamingos added on Sunday morning:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos now is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

6. **Number of white flamingos on Sunday morning:**
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

7. **Difference between the number of pink and white flamingos:**
   - The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

So, there are 6277 kids in Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards:**
   Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month:**
   She collected three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

3. **Cards Collected in the Second Month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

4. **Cards Collected in the Third Month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

5. **Total Number of Cards:**
   Now, we add up all the cards she had initially and the cards she collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week equally for two publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays:
2 * 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence

For 500 sentences at 10 cents each, he earns:
500 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."
"Baldur gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. That's a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails of water every day. Since each pail contains 5 liters of water, the total amount of water he gets every day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

"To calculate how much money John made that year, we need to consider his regular salary, the one-time monetary reward, and the impact of the 5% raise.

1. **Regular Salary:**
   - John makes $2000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his regular salary for the year is \(2000 \times 52 = 104000\) dollars.

2. **5% Raise:**
   - The raise is 5% of his weekly salary.
   - 5% of $2000 is \(2000 \times 0.05 = 100\) dollars per week.
   - With the raise, his new weekly salary is \(2000 + 100 = 2100\) dollars per week.
   - For the year, his salary with the raise is \(2100 \times 52 = 109200\) dollars.

3. **One-Time Monetary Reward:**
   - He received a one-time reward of $5000.

4. **Total Money Made in the Year:**
   - Adding the one-time reward to his salary with the raise: \(109200 + 5000 = 114200\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is **$114,200**."
"First, we need to find out how many tons of grapes Josie's farm produces in a year. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and she has 10 acres, we multiply 5 tons by 10 acres:

5 tons/acre × 10 acres = 50 tons

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from these 50 tons of grapes. Since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply 50 tons by 2 barrels/ton:

50 tons × 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches: \( 2 \text{ slices/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since a sandwich uses 2 slices, an omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total slices of cheese for omelets: \( 3 \text{ slices/omelet} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese for Dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we add up all the slices of cheese used:
\[ 14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of blue pens Janet bought. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. So, the total number of blue pens is:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of red pens Janet bought. She bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens Janet has. She originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Adding the blue and red pens to this, we get:

\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Adding these together:

\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, the final number of pens Janet has is:

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of tests and the desired average:**
   - Mr. Bert gives 6 tests.
   - Brinley wants an average of 93.

2. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   - The formula for the average is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}}\).
   - Rearranging the formula to find the total score: \(\text{Total Score} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of Tests}\).
   - Plugging in the values: \(\text{Total Score} = 93 \times 6 = 558\).

3. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   - Brinley's scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Sum of these scores: \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

4. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Let \(x\) be the score on the sixth test.
   - The total score after removing the lowest score (which is 71) should be 558.
   - The sum of the remaining five scores (excluding 71) plus \(x\) should equal 558.
   - The sum of the remaining scores is \(438 - 71 = 367\).
   - Therefore, \(367 + x = 558\).
   - Solving for \(x\): \(x = 558 - 367 = 191\).

So, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"First, let's calculate the kilometers Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode 25 kilometers each time and did this at least 5 times a week for four weeks.

For the first four weeks:
- Kilometers per ride: 25 km
- Number of rides per week: 5
- Number of weeks: 4

Total kilometers for the first four weeks:
\[ 25 \, \text{km/ride} \times 5 \, \text{rides/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 500 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the kilometers he rode in the following three weeks. He rode 60 kilometers each time and did this 2 times a week for three weeks.

For the next three weeks:
- Kilometers per ride: 60 km
- Number of rides per week: 2
- Number of weeks: 3

Total kilometers for the next three weeks:
\[ 60 \, \text{km/ride} \times 2 \, \text{rides/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 360 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods to find the total distance:

Total kilometers:
\[ 500 \, \text{km} + 360 \, \text{km} = 860 \, \text{km} \]

So, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \, \text{km} \]"
"First, let's determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can find the weight of each candied apple by dividing the weight of a chocolate bar by 2.

Weight of each candied apple = 40g / 2 = 20g

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, each weighing 40g.

Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 * 40g = 1000g

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, each weighing 20g.

Total weight of candied apples = 80 * 20g = 1600g

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.

Total weight of Joe's bag of candy = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

So, the final numerical answer is:

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the cakes from each day together: \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Total cost for half a dozen plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Cost of half a dozen plates = $36000.
   - Cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. **Calculate the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - One dozen cups = $34800 / 20 = $1740.

4. **Calculate the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups = 12 cups.
   - Cost of one cup = $1740 / 12 = $145.

The total cost of buying each cup is $145."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars from babysitting.

Now, let's consider the money Sara earns from mowing the lawn:
- Let \(x\) be the number of times Sara mows the lawn.
- Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so she earns \(4x\) dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn is \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars (from her savings and babysitting).

To find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find \(x\) such that:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final answer:

"First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time taken to walk a certain distance is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour) into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours walking."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total.

So, 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 customers.

Therefore, on the third day, Sloane counted 250 customers."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( S = 8 \) gallons of water. 

The final answer is:

"First, we need to find out the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. 

The final answer is:

\[ 44 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. 

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Janeth will pay in total over 12 months. She is paying $165 each month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we subtract the total payment from the total amount to be returned to find the remaining balance:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, let's find the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.

Given:
- Harriet is 21 years old now.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45."
"First, let's find out how many points each student scored.

Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is \(68 / 2 = 34\). So, Yuri scored \(34 + 10 = 44\) points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[68 + 44 + 85 = 197\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[251 - 197 = 54\]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card James has after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards James has after these changes:

Total cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage is 33.

So, the final answer is:

33%"
"Let's break down the cost step by step:

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"First, let's figure out how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place per minute together.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 \div 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

"First, let's find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest when Ashlyn first went to the farm. 

30% of 120 watermelons were ready:
\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were taken home by Ashlyn. This means the remaining watermelons are:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest:
\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

So, 63 more watermelons were harvested. This means the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Final answer:
21"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars.

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, we calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%, so we find 10% of $240,000.

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, we calculate the registration cost. Each car has a $1000 registration fee, and there are 12 cars.

\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Finally, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration.

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[ 276,000 \]"
"First, let's find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday. Since Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, Kylie collected:

20 (Robert's shells) + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:

25 (shells on Monday) × 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday."
"If there were 50 ants and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.

"There are 36 penguins initially sunbathing.

One-third of them jump in the ocean:
36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go into the cave:
36 ÷ 3 = 12 penguins

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
12 (in the ocean) + 12 (in the cave) = 24 penguins

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 tomatoes per day.

To find out how many tomatoes they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):
9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes/week.

Since a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:
63 tomatoes/week ÷ 3 tomatoes/vine/week = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of pizza slices needed. John has 20 friends and each friend wants 4 slices. So, we multiply 20 by 4:

20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices

Now, since pizzas are sold in slices of 8, we need to find out how many pizzas are required to get at least 80 slices. We do this by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Using Pens to Make New Pens**: For every 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen.

First, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he initially bought. Since he can make 1 new pen from every 5 empty pens, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, from the 25 pens, he can make 5 new pens. Now, we add these 5 new pens to the original 25 pens:

\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

Next, we need to consider if he can make more pens from the 5 new pens. However, since he only has 5 new pens and he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen, he cannot make any more new pens from these 5 pens.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram has is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, so he had:

Now, let's find the sum of their ages:

Jessa's age: 20
Joan's age: 25
Mary's age: 23

Sum of their ages: \(20 + 25 + 23 = 68\)

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"First, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we have:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, 300 students went out through exit A. This means the number of students remaining is:

\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who went out through exit B. Since 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B, we have:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, 420 students went out through exit B. This means the number of students remaining, who went out through exit C, is:

\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, Dolly will read 3 books (2 of her own and 1 from Pandora) and Pandora will read 3 books (1 of her own and 2 from Dolly). 

So, collectively, they will read:
Dolly's total: 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books
Pandora's total: 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books

Adding these together: 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books

"First, let's figure out how many pen pals Mike still has. He originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he now has:

\[5 - 2 = 3\]

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike receives in a week is:

\[3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}\]

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages in a week. Now, we need to calculate how long it takes Mike to write 30 pages. He writes a page every 6 minutes, so the total time he spends writing in minutes is:

\[30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}\]

So, the final answer is:

450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Jason's phone plan includes 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes he used from his monthly plan:

1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes

So, Jason has 250 minutes left."

   \]

3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10

   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin.

5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken.
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2

"First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums. There are 32 snails in one aquarium and 4 snails in the other, so the difference is:

32 - 4 = 28 snails

According to the problem, this difference (28 snails) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. So, we can set up the equation:

28 = 2 * (number of fish in both aquariums)

To find the number of fish in both aquariums, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

28 / 2 = 14

This means there are 14 fish in both aquariums combined. Since the problem states that both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide this number by 2:

14 / 2 = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works each week:

6 hours/day * 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours for the 5 weeks:

24 hours/week * 5 weeks = 120 hours

The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:

120 hours * $250/hour = $30,000

The makeup artist gives a 10% discount for the amount of work done. So, the discount amount is:

10% of $30,000 = 0.10 * $30,000 = $3,000

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid:

$30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Jean paid $27,000."

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Sue ate is \(20 + 26 = 46\).

The total number of cookies her sister ate is \(5 + 13 = 18\).

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, the total calories Sue consumed is \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The total calories her sister consumed is \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight before termites ate any part of it is:

20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so they ate:

30% of 8000 pounds = 0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites ate is:

Next, we need to determine how many cups of flour are required for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies. Therefore, we can find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies by setting up a proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} \]

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price:
\[ 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"First, let's calculate the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.

Transfer fees: 3% of $400,000
\[ 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \]

Brokerage fee: 5% of $400,000
\[ 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \]

Now, let's add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee to the amount Mr. Tan paid for the remaining loan.

Total additional costs: $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) + $250,000 (remaining loan amount)
\[ 12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the total additional costs from the selling price to find Mr. Tan's net proceeds.

Net proceeds: $400,000 (selling price) - $282,000 (total additional costs)
\[ 400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000 \]

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees. It takes 40% longer than the initial 20 minutes.

40% of 20 minutes is:
\[ 20 \times 0.40 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to warm the oil, which was 20 minutes.

So, the cooking time is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time to heat the oil from the start to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
- Time to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees: 28 minutes
- Time to cook the chicken: 15 minutes

Total time:
\[ 20 + 28 + 15 = 63 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:
\[ 63 \text{ minutes} \]"
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- The agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 50 \text{ ads} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- The agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \text{ dollars/ad} \times 15 \text{ ads} = 1125 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} + 1125 \text{ dollars} = 1375 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of:
\[ 1375 \text{ dollars} \]"
"The juggler has 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

4 blue golf balls."
"The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has:
300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has:
300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms. John has 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows. So, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is:

3 bedrooms/house * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows/house

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:

2 houses * 6 windows/house = 12 windows

Next, we need to add the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:

2 houses * 4 windows/house = 8 windows

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows together to get the total number of windows:

12 windows (from bedrooms) + 8 windows (additional) = 20 windows

So, the total number of windows between the houses is:

20"
"First, let's add up the cost of the items the mother bought:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the cashier gives back $5.00."
"First, let's calculate the number of stitches for each part of the sweater.

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches:
\[ \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:
\[ \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \]

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. So, the stitches for the two sleeves can be found by subtracting the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total:
\[ \text{Stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2:
\[ \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: \(800 + 2400 = 3200\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is $3200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."
"First, let's find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, 32 cards had the letter A on them.

Next, we need to find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

Now, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

This means 24 cards had the letter B on them. Now, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Next, 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

This means 15 cards had the letter C on them. Now, we find out how many cards were left after removing the cards with the letter C:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

So, the remaining 9 cards had the letter D on them. Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Matthew spends digging the small holes. Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig one small hole, for 30 small holes, he will spend:

\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time he spends digging the large holes. Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig one large hole, for 15 large holes, he will spend:

\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on both small and large holes:

\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

\[ \text{Final answer: } 4 \text{ hours} \]"
"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 10 + 10 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, we substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

Final answer:
Sam is 6 years old."
"To find out how much Peter paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
- Peter bought 20 popsicles.
- Each popsicle costs $0.25.
- So, the total cost for the popsicles is \( 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
- Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
- Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
- So, the total cost for the ice cream bars is \( 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
- Total cost = cost of popsicles + cost of ice cream bars
- Total cost = \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) dollars.

So, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"First, let's find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has 70 spots and a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to get the combined total:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2450 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 team members + (12 team members * 2 guests) = 12 + 24 = 36 people from the team members and their guests. Adding the 3 coaches, the total number of people is 36 + 3 = 39.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are needed. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3: 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, to find out how much Maddy will spend, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"First, let's figure out the total length taken up by the topaz gemstones. Since Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones and each gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much length is left for the sterling silver beads. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches, so the length taken up by the beads is:

\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads are needed to fill the 17 inches, we divide the remaining length by the length of each bead:

\[ 17 \text{ inches} \div \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads} \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\)
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\)
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\)

Adding these together gives:
\(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\)

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is now. Since Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, we calculate her brother's age as follows:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is currently 18 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents:
\[ 5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly also has 2 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents:
\[ 2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stars in the three rows of 8 stars and the two rows of 6 stars.

For the three rows of 8 stars:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

For the two rows of 6 stars:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Now, let's add these together to find out how many stars are in these five rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has 76 stars in total. To find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows, we subtract the 36 stars from the total:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the 40 stars by 5 stars per row:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars altogether on the flag.

8"
"First, we need to calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are required to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's find the speed of the car in the slow lane. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[ \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, let's find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

22 - 5 = 17 medals

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

22 + 17 = 39 medals

According to the problem, the total number of medals they have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number they have together. So, we multiply the number of medals they have by 10:

39 * 10 = 390 medals

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is 390."
"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars/packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars/adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and the 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them. So, the number of chocolate bars each child will get is:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars/child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. 

The final answer is:

"First, let's figure out how much time Susan actually works.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she takes a half-hour break, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, convert 2.5 hours into minutes:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we divide the total minutes by 10 and then multiply by $5:

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15

15 * $5 = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"First, let's calculate the points each player has after the first three rounds:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra point to each player in the fourth round if they have over 20 points:

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike now has \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony now has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's add up the total points of all three players:

- Mike has 22 points.
- Jim has 18 points.
- Tony has 43 points.

The total points after the fourth round are:

\[22 + 18 + 43 = 83\]

So, the final total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:

- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Second day total:
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Total count of activities:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90

"First, let's calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members eating rice at each meal, so the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Since each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"First, let's add up the crates Sam sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's sum these up:

15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates in a week. So, we need to find out how many crates he was off by subtracting the number of crates he sold from his target:

120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"Let's break down the bidding process step by step.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each bid increases by $50.
3. There are 3 other people who each bid once, so there are 3 additional bids after the opening bid.

The bids can be listed as follows:
- First bid (opening bid): $200
- Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Fourth bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so her bid is the fourth bid. Therefore, Carmen's bid is $350.

The desk costs Carmen $350."
"First, let's calculate the total miles John drives in a day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, which is a total of 60 miles per day.

Next, we calculate the total miles driven in a week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

Now, we calculate the total miles driven in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year.

The cost per mile is $2, so the total cost for the miles driven in a year is 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000.

Now, let's calculate the total bonus he gives his driver. He gives a $150 bonus per month, and since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus for the year is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus to find the total cost for the year. The total cost is $30000 + $1800 = $31800.

So, the final numerical answer is:
$31800"
"First, we need to find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. 

On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.

So, the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. So, we need to multiply the combined time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes.

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's why: Each piece of paper, when folded in half, gives you 4 pages (2 on the front and 2 on the back). So, for 32 pages, you would need 32 divided by 4, which equals 8 pieces of paper. However, since the question asks for a simple folding method where each piece of paper is folded once and then unfolded to show 4 pages, the answer is 16 pages per piece of paper, but since each piece of paper is used for 4 pages, you only need 8 pieces of paper to make 32 pages. 

Final answer:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[200 - 90 - 45 = 65\]

Since each book sells for $20, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

Watson works 10 hours a day and earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:
10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:
$100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:
$500/week + $300/week = $800/week

April typically has 4 weeks, so his total earnings for April are:
$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, we calculate how many people he beat:
20 people * 80% = 20 * 0.8 = 16 people

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total and beat 16, the number of people he lost to is:
20 - 16 = 4 people

So, John lost to 4 people."
"First, let's find out how many loaves are sold in the morning. Two-thirds of the 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This means that the remaining loaves are:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 8 / 4 = 2 pounds per week.

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. So, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.

The final answer is:
4 weeks"
"First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:

- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Now, let's calculate the savings on the milk:

- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings per packet of milk: $0.5

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk:

- Total savings on ice cream: 2 tubs * $2/tub = $4
- Total savings on milk: 4 packets * $0.5/packet = $2

Finally, let's add the savings together:

- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk."
"To find out how many new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many extra arms and legs they will get based on the given intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - Arms grow every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra arm is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - Legs grow every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of times a person will grow an extra leg is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs together:
- Total extra limbs = Extra arms + Extra legs
- Total extra limbs = 5 + 3 = 8

So, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
\[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the suitcases. Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
\[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

Now, let's determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times the cost of a business suit is:
\[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
Adding $700 to this amount gives the cost of the flight ticket:
\[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip. So, the total amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

The amount Theo has left to spend on gifts is:
\[ 4000 - 1950 = 2050 \]

So, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many eggs the family consumes each day.

Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

The rest of the family, which is 5 - 3 = 2 people, eat 2 eggs each, so that's:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

So, the total number of eggs consumed each day is:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Now, to find out how many eggs they consume in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Trent is 32 years old."
"First, let's find out Noah's age six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, Noah's age six years ago was 40 / 2 = 20 years.

Now, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, the population six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 120,000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. This can be expressed as:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot 3D + 2 \cdot \frac{D}{2} = 2 \cdot 105 \]
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final answer:
30"
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Now, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to the 50 marbles already in the store. So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
\[ 20 + 50 = 70 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Solomon's father gave him. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

Now, we add the marbles given by his father to the total number of marbles Solomon already had:
\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per cubic foot. So, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"If the classroom has 30 boys, then it has:

- 3 times as many girls as boys, so it has \(30 \times 3 = 90\) girls.
- 1/10 as many non-binary children as boys, so it has \(30 \div 10 = 3\) non-binary children.

To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and non-binary children:

\[30 \text{ (boys)} + 90 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (non-binary)} = 123\]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires, we can calculate the number of electric poles as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the proportion:

\[ \text{Number of poles} : \text{Number of wires} = 1 : 3 \]

Let the number of poles be \( x \). Then, we have:

\[ x : 45 = 1 : 3 \]

This can be written as:

\[ \frac{x}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We know that 22 men stayed at the party. So, the number of women who stayed can be found by subtracting the number of men who stayed from the total number of people who stayed.

Number of women who stayed = Total people who stayed - Men who stayed
Number of women who stayed = 30 - 22
Number of women who stayed = 8

So, the final numerical answer is:
8"
"The book costs $4, and the magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than a magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The pen costs $1."
"First, let's find out how many pencils Jam has in total. Jam has 26 pencils in total, including 2 loose pencils. This means the number of pencils in the three boxes is:

26 (total pencils) - 2 (loose pencils) = 24 pencils in the boxes.

Now, we need to find out how many pencils Jam and Meg have together:

Jam has 26 pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils.

So, together they have:

26 (Jam's pencils) + 46 (Meg's pencils) = 72 pencils.

Now, we need to find out how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils. Since we know that 3 boxes can store 24 pencils, we can calculate the number of boxes needed for 72 pencils by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils that 3 boxes can store:

72 pencils ÷ 24 pencils per 3 boxes = 3 sets of 3 boxes.

So, they need 3 sets of 3 boxes, which is:

3 × 3 = 9 boxes.

Final numerical answer:
9"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon uses to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. So, the number of ice cubes needed is:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

Next, we need to calculate how much the coffee is weakened by adding these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening of the coffee is:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve this, we need to understand the trade ratio and how it applies to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records traded is \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records."
"First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

This means there are 40 junior programmers. Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. So, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so they are paid:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month} \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the total number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

4. Simplifying the expression, we get \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

5. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation \( x + 6 = 20 \).

6. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, for 40 percentage points, it will take:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert 120 minutes into hours:
\[ 120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her 10 more, so she has:

**Erin has 14 lollipops left.**"
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off the next purchase. So, $80 / $20 = 4. This means they earned $4 in rewards.

On this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their $4 reward. However, they also applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon took 2 * $4 = $8 off the price.

Now, let's calculate the total amount after applying the reward and the coupon:
- The original amount spent was $43.
- After applying the $4 reward, the amount is $43 - $4 = $39.
- After applying the $8 coupon, the amount is $39 - $8 = $31.

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so the annual salary is:
\[ 15 \times 2000 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

With a 20% tax rate, the tax amount is:
\[ 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the net pay for Job A is:
\[ 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B.

Job B pays $42,000 a year. With a 10% tax rate, the tax amount is:
\[ 42,000 \times 0.10 = 4,200 \text{ dollars} \]

After tax, the amount is:
\[ 42,000 - 4,200 = 37,800 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to subtract the $6,000 property tax:
\[ 37,800 - 6,000 = 31,800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs. Job A pays $24,000, and Job B pays $31,800. The difference in net pay is:
\[ 31,800 - 24,000 = 7,800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Nick will make $7,800 more at the job with the higher net pay rate. 

Final answer:
\[ 7,800 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many of the 220 castles are ruins. Since 40 percent of them are ruins, we calculate:

\[ 220 \times 0.40 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate:

\[ 88 \times 0.50 = 44 \]

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United:
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installments: 6 months * $350 = $2,100
- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 months * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, let's find the difference between the two offers:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"First, let's add up all the paintball guns they have:

DJ has 8 guns
Nick has 10 guns
RJ (I assume this is a typo and should be Richard) has 5 guns
Richard has 5 guns

So, the total number of guns is \(8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28\).

Now, we need to share these 28 guns equally among the 4 of them. To find out how many guns each person would get, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\(28 \div 4 = 7\)

So, each of them would have 7 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we can break it down into simple steps.

First, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of suckers.
- For 8 batches, he needs \(30 \times 8 = 240\) ounces of sugar.

Next, calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge:
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for 1 batch of fudge.
- For 1 batch, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

Now, add the amounts together:
- Sugar for suckers: 240 ounces
- Sugar for fudge: 70 ounces
- Total sugar needed: \(240 + 70 = 310\) ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year. Maria bought 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial total value is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The stock price increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price per share after the increase is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

Now, the total value of the shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. So, the new price per share after the decrease is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Now, the total value of the shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

\[ \$72 \]"
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Then the number of chickens is \( 2C \).

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can write the equation:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} + 20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} \]
\[ = 80 + 80 \]
\[ = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have is 160."

"The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."

So, if Tyson runs 1/5 times more, he will run:
\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total distance Tyson would run in June if he trained for the whole month. June has 30 days, so:
\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:
\[ 180,000 \text{ meters} \]"

"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the legs from each type of table and then add them together.

First, we calculate the legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs

Next, we calculate the legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

The total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"First, let's calculate how many cookies Jenny's son eats in a week. He gets 4 cookies 5 days a week, so:

\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week. He eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so:

\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we add the cookies eaten by her son and her husband to find out how many cookies are eaten by them in total:

\[ 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies} \]

The bag of cookies has 36 cookies in total. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the cookies eaten by her son and husband from the total number of cookies:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies} \]

So, Jenny eats:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on one shirt. The original price of one shirt is $30, and the discount is 40%. 

To find the discount amount for one shirt:
\[ 30 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30 \times 0.40 = 12 \]

So, the discount on one shirt is $12. 

Now, let's find the price of one shirt after the discount:
\[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]

So, the price of one shirt after the discount is $18. 

Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we need to find the total cost for 2 shirts:
\[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"First, let's calculate the daily earnings from tractors:

10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, let's calculate the daily earnings from silos:

5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find out the percentage increase in earnings, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.1 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 (the number of months in a year).

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of food:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - So, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **The monthly cost of treats is $20.**

3. **The monthly cost of medicine is $100.**

4. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
   - Total monthly cost = \( 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the yearly cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the yearly cost is \( 220 \times 12 = 2640 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down each activity and calculate the total hours step by step.

1. **Yoga class on Monday**: 1 hour
2. **Cooking class on Tuesday**: 3 times the yoga class, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
3. **Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday**: 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes)
4. **Museum tour on Thursday**: Half the time of the cooking class, so \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours
5. **Errands on Friday**: 2 hours

Now, let's add all these hours together:

\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8\]

"Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. So, the total amount she spent and gave away is $11 + $4 = $15. 

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount spent and given away from the amount she started with:

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the time John spent on each activity:

1. Boating: 6 hours
2. Swimming: Half the time he spent boating, so \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
3. Watching shows: 3 shows, each 2 hours, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Now, let's add up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time by \( T \). We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is:

"First, let's calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her first job. She earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she earns from her second job. She earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money she already has in her savings, the money from her first job, and the money from her second job:

\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so we need to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save:

"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.

The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so it is:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet tall.

The combined height of the shortest and second trees is:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

The tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so it is:
2 × 17 feet = 34 feet tall.

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the toy cars. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the teddy bears. Dean bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find the total amount spent by Dean. The total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears is:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:

"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then we'll subtract this from her budget to see how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. Cost of one round of mini-golf: $5
2. Cost of go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20
3. Arcade tokens: $5

Total cost for Morgan (including one friend):
\[ 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 \]

Now, let's assume Morgan is inviting \( x \) friends. The total cost for Morgan and \( x \) friends would be:
\[ 30(x + 1) \]

Morgan's budget is $90, so we set up the equation:
\[ 30(x + 1) = 90 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x + 1 = \frac{90}{30} \]
\[ x + 1 = 3 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends.

"First, let's calculate how much Marisa spends on lollipops each day. She buys 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, so:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 each day on lollipops.

Next, we need to find out how much money she has left after buying the lollipops. She gets $5 as pocket money every day, so:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Marisa saves $4 each day. If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Billy spent on gumballs. Since gumballs cost $0.05 each and he bought 40 gumballs, the total cost for gumballs is:

\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This means that before buying the gumballs, Billy had $2 less than the amount he had after buying the candy. Let's denote the amount of money Billy had after buying the candy as \( x \). Therefore, before buying the gumballs, he had \( x + 2 \) dollars. Since he spent half of his remaining money on gumballs, the other half must be \( x \). So, we have:

\[ x + 2 = 2x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 2 = x \]

This means Billy had $2 left after buying the candy. Since his father gave him $10, the amount he spent on candy is:

\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount spent on candy by the cost per pound:

\[ \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

So, Billy bought \(\frac{16}{3}\) pounds of candy. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{16}{3}} \]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 miles by the 900 miles traveled per day:
\[18000 \div 900 = 20\]

So, the train goes between services every \(\boxed{20}\) days."
"First, let's figure out how much stuffing is needed for a collie bed. The collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. 

A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."
"First, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive to his friend's house. The distance is 220 miles (200 miles + 10 miles detour) and he drives at 70 mph.

Time to friend's house = Distance / Speed = 220 miles / 70 mph = 3.14 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it took for John to drive back home. The distance is 240 miles and he drives at 80 mph.

Time to return home = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Now, let's add the two times together to get the total time for the trip.

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time to return home = 3.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.14 hours

So, the total time for the trip is 6.14 hours."

1. Points from the first test: 15
2. Points from the second test: 18

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we need to find out how many more points she needs:
\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This number is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence over goods on sale. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

We are given that the total number of people kicked out of the Walmart is 50. Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:

\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for the picture frames. Each picture frame costs $20, and there's an additional 20% cost for etching. So, the etching cost per frame is:

\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

Adding the etching cost to the original cost of the frame:

\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames and etching is:

\[ 44 \times 24 = 1056 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the pins. There are 2 seniors who will receive pins, and each pin costs $5. So, the total cost for the pins is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the cords. One-fourth of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is:

\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

Finally, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts:

\[ 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1208 \]

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[ \boxed{1208} \]"
"If the hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the market and Ethan makes his own DIY version, he saves 20% on the materials cost. 

First, we calculate 20% of $400:
20% of $400 = 0.20 * $400 = $80

So, by making it himself, Ethan saves $80.

Now, we subtract the savings from the original price:
$400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold over the three days, we add the pairs sold each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

"First, we need to find out the value of the faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total equipment was faulty, we calculate 40% of $400,000.

40% of $400,000 = 0.40 * $400,000 = $160,000

This means the faulty pieces of equipment are worth $160,000. Therefore, the value of the functioning pieces of equipment is the total amount minus the value of the faulty pieces.

$400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000

So, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day.

So, the milk from the first half is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

And the milk from the second half is:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Adding both amounts together gives the total milk collected every day:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls.

"First, let's find out how many pupils like blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we calculate:

40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils are left after accounting for those who like blue:

40 pupils - 20 pupils = 20 pupils.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so we calculate:

20 pupils / 4 = 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. To find out how many that is, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:

20 pupils - 5 pupils = 15 pupils like yellow.

So, the final answer is:
15 pupils like yellow."
"First, let's find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since she got $56 from selling the apples at $4 per piece, we can calculate the number of apples sold on Monday by dividing the total money by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, which means:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of apples picked over the three days. We add the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]

Since the apples picked on Monday were all sold, the number of apples picked on Monday is the same as the number sold, which is 14. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she has to repay and then divide it by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest on the loan. The interest rate is 10% per year, and the loan period is 5 months. Since the interest rate is annual, we need to adjust it for 5 months.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $3,650, the rate (R) is 10% or 0.10, and the time (T) is 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year).

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is the principal plus the interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 = 3802.085 \]

Now, we need to divide this total amount by the number of months (5) to find out how much Karan has to pay per month:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."
"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so Cho hiked a total of \(14 \times 8 = 112\) kilometers.

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so Chloe hiked a total of \(9 \times 5 = 45\) kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked: \(112 - 45 = 67\).

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost of making the lemonade. Millie spends $18 on supplies. So, her total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Mr. Ruther had 12.8 hectares left, which represents 2/5 of his original land because he sold 3/5 of it. To find the original amount of land, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times \text{original land} = 12.8 \]

To find the original land, we solve for the original land:

\[ \text{original land} = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

\[ \text{original land} = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

\[ \text{original land} = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land."
"First, let's find out how many boys and girls are in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members:

- Number of boys = 52 * 50% = 26
- Number of girls = 52 * 50% = 26

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:

- Girls who can't make it = 26 * 50% = 13

Therefore, the number of girls who actually perform is:

- Girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

- Total performers = Girls who perform + Teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is:
\[ 80 \]"
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $2.
- We have 6 erasers.
- So, the total cost for the erasers is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $3.
- We have 8 pencils.
- So, the total cost for the pencils is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
- Total cost = cost of erasers + cost of pencils
- Total cost = \( 12 + 24 = 36 \) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet:

- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives 9 rides.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets for each ride:

- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \text{ tickets} \times \$2 \text{ per ticket} = \$4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \text{ rides} \times \$4 \text{ per ride} = \$36\).

Now, let's compare the costs:

- David's cost: $30 (for the bracelet)
- Dasha's cost: $36

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:

\[ \$36 - \$30 = \$6 \]

So, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"First, we need to find out the total number of gifts Monica is wrapping. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, the total number of gifts is:

6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, and then find the difference.

First, let's understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\). The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles, which is \(5x + 6x = 11x\). We know this total is 165 popsicles, so we can set up the equation:

\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now that we have \(x\), we can find the number of popsicles each person has. Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles, and Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services.

Netflix costs $10 a month.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost for both is reduced. The discount per service is 20% of $10, which is $10 * 0.20 = $2. So, each service costs $10 - $2 = $8 after the discount. Since he gets both, the total for Hulu and Disney Plus is $8 + $8 = $16.

Now, let's add up the total cost of the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus: $16
- Total: $10 + $16 = $26

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 a month. By switching to the streaming services, he saves:
- Original cable cost: $60
- New streaming cost: $26
- Savings: $60 - $26 = $34

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his $60 cable package."
"First, let's calculate the time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, so \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours

Now, let's find the total work time:
\[4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}\]

Next, we need to find what percentage of her total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as:
\[
\left(\frac{1.5}{7.5}\right) \times 100 = 20\%

"First, let's find out how many books can fit in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of books it can hold is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that the shelving system can hold. So, we need to calculate double the capacity of the shelving system and then add 20 to it:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ 92 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica had initially:

- Erica made 20 cards.
- Her dad brought 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.

So, the total number of cards Erica had is \(20 + 30 = 50\).

Next, let's see how many cards she gave away and received:

- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

Now, let's calculate the net number of cards Erica has:

- She started with 50 cards.
- She gave away 29 cards.
- She received 17 cards.

So, the calculation is \(50 - 29 + 17\).

Let's do the math:

\[50 - 29 = 21\]
\[21 + 17 = 38\]

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.

Next, we calculate how many slices Mark gets. Mark gets 1/4 of the 12 slices:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:

\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices, so we subtract those from the total number of slices:

\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to save and then determine how many days it will take him to save that amount.

First, we calculate the total amount Mark needs to save:
\[ \text{Total amount needed} = \$300 \]

Next, we subtract the amount Mark already has in his bank account from the total amount needed:
\[ \text{Amount still needed} = \$300 - \$50 = \$250 \]

Now, we know Mark earns $10 per day. To find out how many days he needs to work to save $250, we divide the amount still needed by his daily earnings:
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\$250}{\$10 \text{ per day}} = 25 \text{ days} \]

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days to buy the bike.

"First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we calculate the number of millipedes as follows:

Number of millipedes = 90 / 3 = 30

Next, we need to find out how many stink bugs she saw. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate the number of stink bugs as follows:

Number of stink bugs = (2 * 30) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48

Now, we add up all the bugs she saw:

Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."

"The builder works 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month. So, in one month, he works:

\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is:

\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

If he gets paid $50 every day, his total earnings for the year would be:

"First, let's calculate the energy used by the air conditioner per day before the reduction.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour and runs for 8 hours a day. So, the daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 7200 \text{ watts/day} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy usage to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \text{ watts/day} = 7.2 \text{ kW/day} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

The new daily energy usage is:
\[ 900 \text{ watts/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 2700 \text{ watts/day} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 2.7 \text{ kW/day} \]

The energy saved per day is:
\[ 7.2 \text{ kW/day} - 2.7 \text{ kW/day} = 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \]

Over 30 days, the total energy saved is:
\[ 4.5 \text{ kW/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kW} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ 135 \text{ kW} \]"

Now, let's add up all the stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. There are 4 zebras in total, so we divide the total number of stripes by 4:
\[88 \div 4 = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes is:

"To make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.

So, for 5 sandwiches, he will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend 5 * $7.00 = $35.00.

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the meat and cheese will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"First, let's find out how many corns Allan originally had. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, and he has 40 cannolis, he originally had:

Next, Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total number of cannolis is:

\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

Allan also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which means he bought:

\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns} \]

So, the new total number of corns is:

\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

Now, we need to find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house:

"First, let's calculate the total amount paid to employees in May.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each earning $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So, the weekly pay for one employee is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 600 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total weekly pay for all employees is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming the company operates for 4 weeks in May, the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 24000 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid to employees in June.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means the number of employees remaining in June is:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]

The weekly pay for one employee in June is still $600. So, the total weekly pay for all employees in June is:
\[ 600 \text{ dollars/week} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 18000 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Assuming the company operates for 4 weeks in June, the total amount paid in June is:

"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. 

First, we know that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, we calculate 5% of 50,000 candles:

\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

This means 2,500 candles smell like wet dog.

Next, we know that Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means 1% of the candles are expected to explode. So, we calculate 1% of 50,000 candles:

\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

This means 500 candles are expected to explode.

However, we need to find out how many of the candles that smell like wet dog will also explode. Since the problem does not specify any additional information about the overlap between the two defects, we assume that the defects are independent. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is the product of the two probabilities:

\[ 2,500 \text{ (candles that smell like wet dog)} \times \frac{1}{100} \text{ (probability of exploding)} = 2,500 \times 0.01 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"First, we need to find the discount price of each blouse. Since the blouses are 30% off, we calculate 30% of $20.

30% of $20 = 0.30 × $20 = $6

So, the discount price of each blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the discounted price by 4 to find the total cost.

Total cost = $14 × 4 = $56

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"First, let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
- Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \(x\).

So, Joanne gathers a total of \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\) apples.

- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne's sister gathers a total of \(60 + 45 = 105\) apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ (45 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

3. We also know that the total number of humps is 304, and since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

4. Now we have a system of two equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   c + d = 180 \\
   2c + d = 304
   \end{cases}
   \]

5. To find \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
   \[
   (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
   \]
   \[
   c = 124
   \]

6. Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( d \):
   \[
   124 + d = 180
   \]
   \[
   d = 180 - 124
   \]
   \[
   d = 56
   \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \)."
"First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days, so:

\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out how far he traveled over the next two days, which was 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days. So, we calculate 30% of 800 km:

\[ 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so:

\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled during the two-week trip:

\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"First, let's find the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying 5 by 4.

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches big."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet. So, the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet."
"First, we need to determine how much money Mr. Josue received from the second bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which gave him $4000. So, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital Mr. Josue had. He initially had $5000. So, the total capital now is:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

First, 4 boats came and each carried away 5 cats:
4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats

So, the number of cats left after the boats took some away is:
50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse:
3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:
30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats

Final answer:
12 cats"
"Let's break down the cost month by month.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
   - 6 months * $8/month = $48

2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month.
   - 8 months * $12/month = $96

3. For the remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but the problem states 8 months at the new rate), the cost is $14 per month.
   - 8 months * $14/month = $112

Now, we add up all the costs:
- $48 (first 6 months) + $96 (next 8 months) + $112 (last 8 months) = $256

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $256."
"First, let's find the cost of the jogger jeans. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost:

\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars from the jogger jeans} \]
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars from the tattered jeans} \]

Now, let's find the original price of the jogger jeans. Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans was:

\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans was $24. Now, we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:

\[ 24 - 28 = -4 \]

Since the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost, and the result is negative, it means the tattered jeans originally cost more. The correct interpretation is how much less the jogger jeans cost compared to the tattered jeans, which is:

\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's calculate the capacity of the buses:
4 buses * 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Next, the capacity of the minibusses:
6 minibusses * 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

And the capacity of the minivans:
10 minivans * 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add all these capacities together to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, so she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the soup. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which costs $4. 

25% of $4 is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

Next, the cake costs half of the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy the ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and still has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket for $100, he has $50 left, so the money from selling the cards minus the ticket cost equals $50.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 100 = 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final answer:
150"
"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. So, that means 18 guests were supposed to have two hot dogs, and the other 18 were supposed to have one hot dog each.

The total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
\[ 18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means the first hot dog was for everyone, and the second hot dog was needed for everyone as well. So, 40 guests would need 40 more hot dogs.

Since only 54 hot dogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
\[ 40 - (54 - 36) = 40 - 18 = 22 \]

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many letters are in half of Indras' name. Indras' name has 6 letters, so half of that is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters are in her sister's name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so that would be 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name. So, 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

Final numerical answer:
13"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:

- The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Each of the 5 separate utensils costs $5.00, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's add up the cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, let's see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2
- Her mother gave her $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, let's find out how much more money Dora needs:
More money needed = Total cost - Total money Dora has
More money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons."
"First, we need to find out how much gas is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

15 gallons ÷ 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Next, we need to find out how much gas Josey needs. Josey needs 1/4 of a container, so we calculate:

3 gallons/container × 1/4 container = 3/4 gallon

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

3/4 gallon × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"First, let's figure out how much money George had left after buying the chips. He spent 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so:

\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Since George had 1% of his money left after this purchase, the 120 cents represent 99% of the money he originally had. Let's denote the total amount of money George had as \( x \) cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.99x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{0.99} \approx 121.21 \text{ cents} \]

Since George spent $5, which is 500 cents, and he had approximately 121.21 cents left, the amount he actually spent is:

\[ 500 - 121.21 \approx 378.79 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we know he spent 120 cents on chips, so the amount spent on candy bars is:

\[ 378.79 - 120 = 258.79 \text{ cents} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, the number of candy bars he bought is:

\[ \frac{258.79}{75} \approx 3.45 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 3 candy bars. 

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends. He has four friends, so we divide the 20 lollipops equally among them: 20 ÷ 4 = 5 lollipops per friend.

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops."
"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and she cuts it into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that's 2 pieces in total. 

Each piece would weigh \( \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) ounces.

So, they together have \( 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \) ounces of cake.

The remaining cake would weigh \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) ounces.

"First, let's find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:

34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Now, they want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means there are a total of 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges per person

So, everyone will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine needs. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00 per pound = $8.00.

Next, the cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00 per box = $4.00.

The total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by rearranging the formula:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought. Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

- Red beads: \(1 \text{ pack} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 20 \text{ beads}\)
- Clear beads: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 40 \text{ beads}\)

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads}\]

Next, let's calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. We can calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought as follows:

- Blue beads: \(3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads}\)
- Red beads: \(4 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 80 \text{ beads}\)

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads}\]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads one sister has than the other. We subtract the total number of beads Elizabeth bought from the total number of beads Margareth bought:
\[140 - 60 = 80\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - After 1 hour, the temperature is \(40 + 5 = 45\) degrees.
   - After 2 hours, the temperature is \(45 + 5 = 50\) degrees.
   - After 3 hours, the temperature is \(50 + 5 = 55\) degrees.

3. **Opening the Window**: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - In 30 minutes, the temperature will cool down \(30 / 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.
   - So, the final temperature is \(55 - 6 = 49\) degrees.

The house's final temperature is **49 degrees**."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, James's swim time is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. So, James's bike time is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( x \) minutes. The total time for James is:
\[ 36 + 85 + x \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is 59 minutes."
"First, let's find out how long Movie C is in minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"First, let's find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes. Since the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH), we can calculate the distance as follows:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Given that 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay} = 16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail per mile} = 8 \, \text{bails} \]

Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost of the hay is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{dollars per bail} = 24 \, \text{dollars} \]

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which means he has:

\[ \text{Total Money} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{dollars} \]

The change Michael will have after buying the hay is:

\[ \text{Change} = 30 \, \text{dollars} - 24 \, \text{dollars} = 6 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."
"First, we need to calculate Joey's new score after his turn. Joey originally has 214 points and scores an additional 26 points.

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

So, Joey now has 240 points.

Next, we calculate Marcy's new score after her turn. Marcy originally has 225 points and scores an additional 10 points.

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy now has 235 points.

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score.

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

"First, let's calculate the cost per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost per sneaker is:

\[ \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker} \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each:

\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since he started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 at the flash sale, he had:

\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers left} \]

He sold these 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each:

\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars} \]

The total revenue from selling all the sneakers is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store:

\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total cost is $576, so the profit is:

\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:

\[ \boxed{539} \]"

4 packets * 16 pieces/packet = 64 pieces

Now, let's add the two totals together to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought:

48 pieces + 64 pieces = 112 pieces

So, Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons in all."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. If you buy the super ticket, the total cost is:
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total: $20 + $1 = $21

2. If you buy a regular movie ticket and a separate popcorn with a soda, the total cost is:
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $P (unknown price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total: $12 + $P + $3 = $15 + $P

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. So, the cost of the regular ticket and the separate popcorn and soda should be $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 15 + P = 21 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 19 \]
\[ P = 19 - 15 \]
\[ P = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's find the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons at the new price. The cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, the final answer is:

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, calculate the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance is \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- For the second part, the car drives 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance is \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\).

Now, add the distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\).

Next, calculate the total time taken:
- Total time = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

Finally, calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

The car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the total value of her sapphires is:
\[ 8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The value of the 3 sapphires she trades is:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, she has:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires} \]
and
\[ 2 \text{ rubies} \]

The value of the 5 sapphires she still has is:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The value of the 2 rubies she received is:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies gives:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:
\[ \boxed{6400} \]"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day. In 30 days, they would eat 8 * 30 = 240 apples.

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height. So, for one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's find out how many green cards there are. If there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many yellow cards there are. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is 50 / 2 = 25 fairies. So, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, so the remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Final number of fairies remaining: 45"
"First, let's find the total number of puppies:

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, let's find the total number of puppies with spots:

Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots, and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the fraction:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]

Then, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ 35\% \]"
"First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying:

1. **Sugar Cubes**: 2 boxes at 1 pound each = 2 pounds
2. **Carrots**: 4 bags at 12 pounds each = 48 pounds
3. **Hay**: 42 bales at 75 pounds each = 3150 pounds
4. **Oats**: 20 sacks at 65 pounds each = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:

\[ 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number because the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip:

\[ \frac{4500}{2250} = 2 \]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
- Grayson drinks 3 cans a week.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, for cans, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents per week.

For the plastic bottles:
- Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, for bottles, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents per week.

Now, let's find out how much she earns in total each week by adding the earnings from cans and bottles:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total monthly earnings = \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the final answer is:
\[
84

"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we calculate 60% of 10:

60% of 10 = 0.60 * 10 = 6

So, Toni has 6 more plants than Frederick. Since Frederick has 10 plants:

Toni's plants = Frederick's plants + 6
Toni's plants = 10 + 6 = 16

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Since Toni has 16 plants:

Shondra's plants = Toni's plants - 7
Shondra's plants = 16 - 7 = 9

So, Shondra has 9 plants."

The total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust to the last possible positive spot, which is 5th place.
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(5 + 2 = 7\). So, she is now in 7th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(7 - 3 = 4\). So, she is now in 4th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(4 + 1 = 5\). So, she is now in 5th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 5th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck. So, the total number of basketball cards is:
\[ 6 \times 25 = 150 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards. She has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. So, the total number of baseball cards is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Now, let's find the total number of cards Miss Maria has by adding the basketball and baseball cards together:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:
\[ 350 - 50 = 300 \]

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is:
\[ \frac{300}{10} = 30 \]

So, the number of students Miss Maria has is:

"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a $1 discount, so:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

She received a 10 percent discount, so we need to find 10 percent of $10.00:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

Subtract the discount from the total:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:

"To find the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of laundry for one room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Adding these together gives the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
\[2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\]

Since there are 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces of laundry per room by 80:
\[15 \times 80 = 1200\]

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is:
\[1200\]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he starts with 100 pairs (200 shoes / 2 = 100 pairs).

2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, so he now has 100 + 5 = 105 pairs.

3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 more pairs, so he now has 105 + 15 = 120 pairs.

4. On Friday, he gains 30 more pairs, so he now has 120 + 30 = 150 pairs.

5. By Saturday, he has 150 pairs, which is 300 shoes (150 pairs * 2 shoes per pair).

6. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes, so he now has 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes."
"First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Mary can decorate with all her sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, we multiply 6 by 8:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Now, we need to find out how many pans of cupcakes she should bake. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's find out the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2. Three times the price of the pen is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars. The piece of paper costs $1 less than this, so it costs \(6 - 1 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper to find the total cost. The total cost is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given: \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

"First, let's find out how many pencils were there initially. There are 30 students, and each started with 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils at the start is:

\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils left after two months is:

\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to find the combined length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to convert the shark's body length from feet to inches because the remoras' length is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark's body length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find what percentage 12 inches is of 120 inches. We do this by dividing the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have desktop computers. We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4

So, each child gets 5 books."
"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we need to first figure out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things (dairy or peanuts).

We know:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

When we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, we count the kids allergic to both twice. So, we need to subtract the number of kids allergic to both to avoid double-counting.

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the things is:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the final answer is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each plane ticket costs $5000, for two tickets, the cost is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of the hotel. The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day, but it is 20% more expensive because it is a busy weekend. So, the increased price per day is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]
Adding this to the normal price gives:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to get the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

To find the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has, we add the tubes of blue and yellow paint together:
\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

Jasper has 11 tubes of paint."
"The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now, we add the weight of both pennies to find the combined weight:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"First, let's find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, and Gabriel has 20 songs, Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more songs each can add to their players. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs:

- Gabriel can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

- Luri can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

If he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, the time he spends running each week is:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, James runs 6 hours a week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of oats Uncle Ben's horses consume in one day.

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and is fed twice a day, so each horse eats:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total amount of oats consumed by all horses in one day is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much oats the horses will consume over five days:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 200 pounds of oats:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"First, we find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranian puppies are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we calculate:

"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we first need to add the highest temperatures together and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48 degrees Fahrenheit
- Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
- Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

Adding these together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30 degrees Fahrenheit

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 / 3 = -10 degrees Fahrenheit

So, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4 saved. So, the remaining amount he needs is:

$12 - $4 = $8

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

Therefore, Sally spends a total of $32."
"First, let's calculate the total cost before any discounts. Each pack of razors costs $4.00, and she is buying 2 packs.

\[ 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pack} = \$8.00 \]

Since the razors are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, the second pack is free. So, the effective cost for 2 packs is just the cost of 1 pack.

\[ \text{Effective cost for 2 packs} = \$4.00 \]

Now, she has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract that from the effective cost.

\[ \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00 \]

This $2.00 is the total cost for 8 razors (since 2 packs contain 8 razors).

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors.

\[ \frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents.

\[ \$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor is 25 cents."
"First, let's calculate the total height of the cheerleaders in the pyramid.

9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall is:
\[ 9 \times 64 = 576 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the height of the 10th cheerleader:
\[ 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

In the pyramid, the 4 cheerleaders on the bottom, 3 on top of them, 2 on top of the 3, and the shortest (60 inches tall) at the top. So, we need to add the heights of these cheerleaders:

The height of the 4 cheerleaders on the bottom:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the 3 cheerleaders on top:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the 2 cheerleaders on top:
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the shortest cheerleader at the top:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \]

Adding all these heights together:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[ 53 \text{ feet} \]"
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour. She works for 8 hours a day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, she has walked 200 minutes after 5 days."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Brett's current age is 14, so three times that is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).
4. This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old.
5. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 from 42 (since we are looking at her age now, not in four years). So, \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Angela is currently 38 years old.

38"
"To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for morning rides is \( 6 \times 14 = 84 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) dollars.

Now, we add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = cost of morning rides + cost of afternoon rides
- Total cost = \( 84 + 28 = 112 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
112"
"First, let's find out how many oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne to find the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie. Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges:

\[ 120 \text{ oranges} \div 3 \text{ oranges/pie} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let's denote the number of guests by \( x \).

**Cost at the first venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Cost at the second venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (which includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the costs are equal. So, we set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
   \[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Bodhi found \( B \) insects.
2. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found \( \frac{B}{2} \) insects.
3. Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \left( \frac{B}{2} + 7 \right) = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B + \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ B + B + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 2B + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2B = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ B = 18 \]

So, Bodhi found 18 insects. Now we can find out how many insects David found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

And how many insects Lily found:
\[ \frac{B}{2} + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, Lily found \(\boxed{16}\) insects."
"First, we need to find out how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used individually and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

To find out how much yarn they used altogether, we add these fractions:
\[ \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]

So, they used \( \frac{3}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 364 yards:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273 \]

So, they used 273 yards of yarn altogether."
"First, let's calculate the number of gifts for Cherrie's friends:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts
- 3 friends want 2 gifts each: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts

Adding these together, the total number of gifts for her friends is \(10 + 6 = 16\) gifts.

Cherrie also decides to get 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the previous total:

\(16 + 10 = 26\)

Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts."
"First, let's find the width of the rug. Since the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet wide.

Next, we need to find the length of the couch. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

Twice the width of the rug = 2 × 8 feet = 16 feet.

Now, add 2 feet to this:

16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

So, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which costs $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which costs half as much as the grape pack, so it costs $1.
5. The total cost of all the packs is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber. The 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and yields 200 sticks, while the 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as possible since they are cheaper. 

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]
So, he can buy 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood, which will give him:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Since the 2 x 8 pieces are more expensive, it's not cost-effective to buy any of them with the remaining budget. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[ 1200 \]

Final answer:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many legs all the dogs have. Since Mario has 6 sled dogs and each dog has 4 legs, the total number of legs is:

6 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 24 legs

Since snowshoes are needed for each leg, Mario needs 24 pairs of snowshoes. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is:

24 pairs * $12.00/pair = $288.00

So, the final cost for the snowshoes is $288.00."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips in a week without the weekly bus pass.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of trips in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for 10 trips is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, if Janet buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would only pay $20 for the entire week.

To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total cost of the individual trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \$2.00 \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm doesn't have any cows, so this part is just a distractor. 

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, so the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so \(30 + 10 = 40\) animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep, so it has 20 animals.

Adding the animals from both the farm and the zoo: \(40 + 20 = 60\).

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 60 animals."
"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, we can find out how many Sophia bought by dividing the number Rose bought by 4.

For onions:
12 onions / 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

Final numerical answer:
4"
"First, let's calculate the number of days Andy has to achieve his goal. Since today is December 31st and his birthday is July 19th, we need to count the days from January 1st to July 18th.

- January has 31 days
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March has 31 days
- April has 30 days
- May has 31 days
- June has 30 days
- July 1st to July 18th is 18 days

Adding these up:
31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 18 (July) = 199 days

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and to lose 1 pound, he needs to create a 3500-calorie deficit. So, for 30 pounds, he needs a total deficit of:
30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

Now, we need to find out how many calories he needs to burn each day to reach this total deficit over 199 days:
105,000 calories / 199 days ≈ 527.64 calories/day

Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 528 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day. There are 7 days in a week, so he earns:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we multiply 0.25 km by 8:

0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km

Now, we know Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Since she runs 2 km, we multiply 60 ml by 2:

60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie spent 20% of $500 on clothes. That's 0.20 * $500 = $100 on clothes.

So, the remaining money after buying clothes is $500 - $100 = $400.

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. That's 0.25 * $400 = $100 on CDs.

So, the money Julie has left is $400 - $100 = $300.

**$300**"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the cost of the lot be \( L \).
2. The cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot, so the cost of the house is \( 3L \).
3. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   L + 3L = 120,000
   \]
4. Combine like terms:
   \[
   4L = 120,000
   \]
5. Solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
   \]
6. The cost of the house is \( 3L \):
   \[
   3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000

So, the cost of the house is $90,000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags. Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The profit is \(320 - 32 = 288\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes in a fight.
2. Multiply the total number of minutes by the number of punches Joe throws per minute.

First, let's find the total number of minutes in a fight. A fight consists of 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, the total number of minutes is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Joe throws 25 punches per minute. So, the total number of punches he throws in 15 minutes is:

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount from the $10 bills is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The total amount from the $20 bills is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Ali has:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining amount of money Ali has after giving half to his sister is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

"First, let's figure out how many quarts each person can pick per hour.

Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four of them:
\[ 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \]

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is:

"First, we need to determine how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant. Since he can fit 6 red tulips in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

36 red tulips ÷ 6 tulips/row = 6 rows of red tulips

Next, we calculate the number of rows of blue tulips. Since he can fit 8 blue tulips in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

24 blue tulips ÷ 8 tulips/row = 3 rows of blue tulips

Now, we add the number of rows of red tulips and the number of rows of blue tulips to find the total number of rows:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers

So, the final numerical answer is:

9 rows"
"First, we need to determine how much of the raisins will be used for each item if Heather divides the bag equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix. Since there are 3 items and the raisins are divided equally, each item will get:

\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies takes \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, we divide 9 cups by \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ h} = 288 \text{ kWh} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption is:
\[ 288 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2016 \text{ kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

Now, let's calculate Ada's new weekly electric consumption and cost after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so the additional daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ h} = 48 \text{ kWh/day} \]

Adding this to her original daily consumption, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 288 \text{ kWh/day} + 48 \text{ kWh/day} = 336 \text{ kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \text{ kWh/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2352 \text{ kWh} \]

The cost of her new weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2352 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \]

The difference between her new weekly electric bill and her original weekly electric bill is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are working together, they can paint the house 5 times faster than one person. So, we divide the time it takes one person by 5.

10 days ÷ 5 people = 2 days

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint the house:

2 days × 24 hours/day = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"First, let's figure out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, we calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} \]
\[ \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas Jenna has:

\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:

\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has} + \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas} = 20 + 64 = 84 \]

\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} + \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} \]
\[ \text{Total number of chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88 \]

\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = \text{Total number of sofas} + \text{Total number of chairs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"First, we need to find out the cost of the headphone set. We know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD cost $4. So, the cost of the headphone set is:

$48 (total) - $4 (CD) = $44 (headphone set)

Now, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $48. To find out how many more CDs he could buy, we need to see how many $4 CDs fit into the $48:

$48 / $4 = 12 CDs

"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 8 weeks, which totals to \(4 \times 8 = 32\) hours. Additionally, he worked out for 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks, which totals to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours. And he also worked out for 6 hours in one week, which totals to \(6 \times 1 = 6\) hours.

Adding all these together, the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \(32 + 10 + 6 = 48\) hours.

So, the final answer is:
48"
"Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

At the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so now there are \(48 - 8 = 40\) passengers.
- 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers get on.
- Now, the number of passengers is \(40 + 40 = 80\).

At the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so now there are \(80 - 21 = 59\) passengers.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off at the first stop, which means \(8 \div 3 \approx 2.67\). Since the number of passengers must be a whole number, we assume it's 3 passengers (as typically you can't have a fraction of a person).
- Now, the number of passengers is \(59 - 3 = 56\).

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is 56."
"First, let's figure out Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then he is currently:

\[ 27 - 5 = 22 \]

So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

Next, we need to determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years. Let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as \( C \).

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \( C + 8 \) years old. According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Jame's age in 8 years will be:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And 5 years younger than that is:

\[ 60 - 5 = 55 \]

Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old. This means:

\[ C + 8 = 55 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = 55 - 8 = 47 \]

So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

Now, we need to find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:

\[ 47 - 22 = 25 \]

The number of years that separate the age of the two now is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"The computer cost $1,100. The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

The total cost for the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, the cost for the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300.

So, one monitor cost $300."
"The boys brought back 60 seashells each. 

The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, each girl brought back 60 (from the boys) + 4 * 60 (four times as many as the boys) seashells.

Calculating that:

4 * 60 = 240

So, each girl brought back 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 * 2 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thickness of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Emma made a total of 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add those up:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month.

18 vlogs"
"First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill.

20% of $50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10.

Now, add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you are paying the full amount including the tip, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[ 60 \]

So, you ended up paying $60."
"First, let's find out how much each boy initially gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. 

\[ \text{Each boy gets} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The eldest boy starts with $6. He then adds $5 to his share:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The following day, he adds another $10:

\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends $8:

\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $8, he triples the amount he has left:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount he has is:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second half of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.
   - Therefore, in the second half of April, Elvis saves \( 2x \) each day.

3. **Calculate the total savings for the first half of April:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

4. **Calculate the total savings for the second half of April:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings for the month:**
   - Total savings for the month = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

6. **Equate the total savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

8. **Determine the daily savings for the second half of April:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the apples, oranges, and peaches.

For the apples:
3 apples * $1.50 each = $4.50

For the oranges:
5 oranges * $0.80 each = $4.00

For the peaches:
6 peaches * $0.75 each = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

"First, let's calculate how much Jairus earns. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's earnings are:

\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Jenny earns. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task and she also finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's earnings are:

\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny. We subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this, we need to understand how the number of families notified grows with each round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

So, during the fourth round of calls, **81 families** will be notified."

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:

\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. So, we need to calculate 10% of $30.00 and subtract it from the total:

\[10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Next, we calculate the commission for the sales over $1000. Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]
The commission for this amount is 10%, so:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts of commission together to find the total commission earned:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

Now, to find out how many additional bottles Bill needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.

So, twice the time it takes in cold water is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to that gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

This is the time it takes Ray to swim one mile in warm water. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water, we multiply 34 minutes by 3:
\[ 34 \times 3 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in cold water. Since it takes him 16 minutes to swim one mile in cold water, for 3 miles it would be:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:

Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 130 pounds

Next, we need to find out how much Bob weighs. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we can calculate Bob's weight as follows:

Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds
Bob's weight = 260 pounds

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds
Total weight = 540 pounds

Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3
Average weight = 180 pounds

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the sun relative to the pyramid and then calculate the final angle.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which means the initial angle of the sun from the ground is also 32 degrees.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
4. The sun moves for 10 hours.

So, the sun will move up by \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the initial angle of the sun from the ground is 32 degrees, after 10 hours, the angle will be:

"First, let's figure out the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since each son needs one candle per year, the 12-year-old needs 12 candles, and the 8-year-old needs 8 candles. So, James needs a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, to find out how much James spends, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack: 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read each night in the first week. She read for 15 minutes each night.

There are 7 nights in a week, so in the first week, she read:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} \]

So, in 105 minutes, she read:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4 \text{ pages}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \) years.
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

First, we express Shiloh's age in 7 years:
\[ S + 7 = 44 + 7 = 51 \]

Next, we express the nephew's age in 7 years:
\[ N + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:

\[ 30 = 3N \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"First, let's figure out how much Peter spends each day. Since he has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for 7 days, he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, for 4 days, he spends:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

Now, he has spent $40, so he has $30 left for the rest of the week. For the remaining 3 days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Adding the wooden and plastic action figures together, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

- First flower shop: 20 roses
- Second flower shop: 15 roses
- Third flower shop: 30 roses

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Ford grows 40 roses every week. So, the number of roses he lacks each week is:

65 (needed) - 40 (grown) = 25 roses

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is:

25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses

Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
"To find out how much money Katina will have after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount she withdraws over that period and then subtract it from her initial amount.

1. Calculate the total number of months in 2 years:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount withdrawn over 24 months:
   \[
   24 \text{ months} \times \$100/\text{month} = \$2400
   \]

3. Subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the account:
   \[
   \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600
   \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have \$600 remaining in her savings account."
"First, let's calculate the cost of making 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (since 1 loaf makes 10 sandwiches).

The cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost for 10 sandwiches is:
\[ 3.00 + 30.00 = 33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches:
\[ 10 \text{ sandwiches} \times 7.00 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 70.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the revenue:
\[ 70.00 - 33.00 = 37.00 \]

So, the net profit is:
\[ 37.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has:

- Each box contains 64 crayons.
- Kate has 3 boxes.

So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we need to determine how many crayon muffins Kate can make. Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayon:

\[ \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money Kate can make by selling these muffins. Each muffin is sold for $1.50:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the total amount of money Kate can make is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of the bedroom:
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:
\[ \text{Cost of carpet and padding} = (12 + 2) \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 14 \times 216 = 3024 \, \text{dollars} \]

Then, we'll calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 4 \times 216 = 864 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, we'll calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \, \text{dollars per square foot} \times 216 \, \text{square feet} = 34 \times 216 = 7344 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we'll add all these costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 + 864 + 7344 = 11232 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the final cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \boxed{11232} \]"
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

First, we add up all the birds:

50 (Day 1 and 2) + 0 (Day 3) + 120 (Day 4 and 5) + 20 (Day 6) + 90 (Day 7) = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7 days):

280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a value of 20.
2. She adds half of this value to it: \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. She then divides this result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Finally, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12: \(6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 cards. Together, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.

"First, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 but actually reaches 468. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.

To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after being 4% too hot.

Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( x \). The actual temperature will be \( x + 0.04x = 1.04x \). We want this to be 520 degrees:
\[ 1.04x = 520 \]
\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to add the lengths of both movies together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, the second movie is:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"First, we need to find the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract it from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is:
\[ 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

So, the value of Juan's house is:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house and Herb's house to find the combined value:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

120"
"First, let's find out the cost of one box of contacts with the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and it's currently 10% off.

10% of $100.00 is:
\[ 100.00 \times \frac{10}{100} = 10.00 \]

So, the discount is $10.00. Therefore, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. So, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ 1.00 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 1.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total for Jill: \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
Total for John: \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours

Now, let's calculate how much each person earned.

Jill earned:
- \(3\) hours \(\times\) $10/hour = $30

John earned:
- \(7\) hours \(\times\) $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- \(70 - 30 = 40\)

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

So, for 1600 calories, the amount of water she needs is:
(1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = 8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"First, let's list out the typing speeds Jared has:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After another increase: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Now, we need to find the average of these three measurements. The formula for the average is:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
\]

So, we add up the three measurements:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we need to calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \( 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \( 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \( 8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds} \)

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"First, let's calculate the number of people invited via email and their friends. Alex invited 100 people via email, and each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is:

100 people * 2 friends/person = 200 friends

Adding the initial 100 people to these 200 friends, we get:

100 + 200 = 300 people

Next, Alex calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, we add these 10 friends to the total:

300 + 10 = 310 people

Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, we need to add these 8 spouses to the total:

310 + 8 = 318 people

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots and shipping on eBay:
- Boot cost: $13
- Shipping cost: $4 (Amazon's shipping cost) * 2 = $8
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- Difference in cost: $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1

So, the boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- **Day 0:** The beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- **Day 1:** The beanstalk doubles its height, so it becomes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- **Day 2:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- **Day 3:** The beanstalk doubles its height again, so it becomes \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

On Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than 20 feet.

Therefore, it takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's figure out how much protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms each day. 

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, 200 grams would have twice as much protein because 200 is double 100. 

Therefore, 200 grams of mushrooms would have \(3 \times 2 = 6\) grams of protein.

Now, if John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 6 grams of protein each day. 

To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\(6 \times 7 = 42\)

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( x \) years.
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( x - 5 \) years.
3. According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x = 2 \times (x - 5)
   \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = x - 10
   \]
   Add 10 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]
   So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.
5. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

Each implant costs $2000, and George needs 2 implants:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

For one of the implants, he wants a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600, so we subtract that from the total cost:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900. He makes $15 per hour, so we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ 3900 \div 15 = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees.
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 30 \]

Now, we can find the measures of the other two angles:
- The angle that is twice the smallest angle is \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- The angle that is three times the smallest angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is \( 90 \) degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ 90 \]"
"First, let's figure out how much money Colby has in total.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 25 = 200\) cents.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 10 = 60\) cents.
- Colby has 14 nickels. Since each nickel is worth 5 cents, 14 nickels are worth \(14 \times 5 = 70\) cents.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since each penny is worth 1 cent, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \times 1 = 15\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the money Colby has:
\[200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}\]

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
\[345 \div 5 = 69\]

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

Final answer:
69"
"To find the total number of legs, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Now, we add up all the legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

8 pounds + (50% of 8 pounds) = 8 pounds + (0.50 * 8 pounds) = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

So, the weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve gets 5 games for his birthday.
   - He also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for 3 years, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

2. **Games Bought Over the Years:**
   - **First Year:** He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
   - **Second Year:** He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so that's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
   - **Third Year:** He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so that's \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

3. **Total Games:**

Now, let's do the addition:

\[5 + 15 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 104\]

So, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is **104**."
"First, we need to find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to travel 2000 miles is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles. 

The final answer is:

"First, let's find out how much chocolate Ruiz makes in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he makes:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how much Marissa makes in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in one hour, so:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds} \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how much each of them makes in 12 hours. For Ruiz:

\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:

\[ 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolate they made together:

\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate they made together is:

\[ 1260 \text{ pounds} \]"

For the first four hours:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup * 4 hours = $30

Next, let's calculate how much money he earned in the next two hours. He sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.

For the next two hours:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup * 2 hours = $12

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods to find the total amount of money Patrick earned.

Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42

"First, let's find out how many rotations one tire undergoes per mile. Since the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the rotations per mile as follows:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles Jeremy drives in a year. Since he drives 400 miles a month, in a year he drives:

\[ 400 \times 12 = 4800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total number of rotations one tire undergoes in a year:

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 362.5 \times 4800 = 1,740,000 \]

We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced. To find out how many years the tire can last, we divide the total allowable rotations by the rotations per year:

\[ \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \]

So, the tire needs to be replaced after \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"First, we need to determine the total number of washings per pump. According to the directions, 2 pumps give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The bottle costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost per pump and we know that 1 pump gives 60 washings, we can find the cost per pump by multiplying the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \times 60 \text{ washings per pump} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

To convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:

\[ 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Final answer:
\[ 1200 \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt and the shorts.

The shirt originally costs $25, and there's a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

Therefore, the price of the shirt after the discount is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35, and there's no discount mentioned for the shorts, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. Since the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $52.50, which is more than $50, Joe does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he cannot make the purchase with the given amount of money.

Final answer:
\[ \text{Joe cannot make the purchase.} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. He plans to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days.

So, the total number of dozens he wants to make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much butter he will need for 28 dozen croissants. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, for 28 dozen croissants, he will need:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"First, we calculate the cost to repave Monica's street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 per meter. So, the cost for Monica's street is:

150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street. Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and it also costs $194 per meter. So, the cost for Lewis' street is:

490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street."
"First, let's calculate the total duration of the research. The initial funding covers 5 months, and the research takes 10 times that long, so the total duration is:

\[ 5 \text{ months} \times 10 = 50 \text{ months} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the research cost each month. The first 5 months cost $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the cost per month is 50% more than the initial cost. So, the cost per month for the remaining months is:

\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the first 5 months and the remaining 45 months. The cost for the first 5 months is:

\[ 100,000 \times 5 = 500,000 \]

The cost for the remaining 45 months is:

\[ 150,000 \times 45 = 6,750,000 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost of the research:

\[ 500,000 + 6,750,000 = 7,250,000 \]

So, the total cost of the research is:

\[ \boxed{7250000} \]"
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March. March has 31 days.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

Step 1: Number of days in March = 31

Step 2: Each member posts 3 times a day, and there are 1000 members.
So, the total number of posts per day = 1000 members * 3 posts/member = 3000 posts/day

Step 3: Total number of posts in March = 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 2 * 52 = 104 times a year.

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses 104 * 20 = 2080 gallons of water.

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends 2080 * 0.15 = $312.

Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Aquarium**: $10.00
2. **Rocks**: 2 bags at $2.50 each
   \[
   2 \times 2.50 = 5.00
   \]
3. **Coral**: 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   \[
   3 \times 2.00 = 6.00
   \]
4. **Fish**: 20 fish at $0.50 each
   \[
   20 \times 0.50 = 10.00
   \]
5. **Fish food**: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00

"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, he sells:

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for Prince to sell the 750kg of meat from Bill's bull. We do this by dividing the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells per day:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

"First, let's find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so:

\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats} \]

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

This means there are:

\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats} \]

left unoccupied by the administrators. One-third of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats} \]

This leaves:

\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats} \]

occupied by the students. So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

\[ 36 \]

"First, let's calculate the total number of street lights. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

Next, we need to find out how many street lights are functioning. If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ total lights} - 20 \text{ not working lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 76 \]"
"Each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. 

The first DVD has been played 356 times, so it can be played \(1000 - 356 = 644\) more times.
The second DVD has been played 135 times, so it can be played \(1000 - 135 = 865\) more times.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining play counts together:
\[644 + 865 = 1509\]

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 more times before they break."
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went twice a week for 2 hours each time.

Each session is 2 hours, and he had 2 sessions per week. So, each week he spent:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \]

He went to therapy for 6 weeks, so the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The cost per hour is $125, so the total cost for 24 hours is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for John's physical therapy is:
\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Gum Pack**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.

2. **Gum Chewing at School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister. So, he gives:

"First, let's calculate how much the baseball coach spent. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

Next, let's calculate how much the basketball coach spent. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total:

$112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"First, we need to find the total number of flowers Arianna planted. She has 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row. So, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed."
"First, let's convert Ashley's internet speed from kb/s to Mb/s.

1 Mb = 1000 kb

Ashley's speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to Mb/s, we divide by 1000:

20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Now, we need to find out how much data she can download in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour.

0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s = 72 Mb/h

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, it pulled:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the previous days. So it pulled:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

For the remaining four days, it pulled:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the cars from the first three days and the last four days gives:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars it towed that week is:
54 cars"
"First, we need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide Adam's height by 12:

40 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet

The roller coaster requires 4 feet to ride. Adam needs to grow:

4 feet - 3.33 feet = 0.67 feet

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert the required growth from feet to inches:

0.67 feet × 12 inches/foot = 8.04 inches

Now, we calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8.04 inches at a rate of 2 inches per year:

8.04 inches ÷ 2 inches/year = 4.02 years

Since Adam can't grow a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, it will take Adam 5 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"First, let's calculate the total cost the company paid to acquire the cars. Since they paid 30% of the price of each car, and each car cost $25,000, the cost per car is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total cost for the company is:

\[ 7,500 \times 10 = 75,000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the cars. Since each car was sold for $25,000 and he sold 10 cars, the total revenue is:

\[ 25,000 \times 10 = 250,000 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright, we calculate:

25% of 100 riders = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Out of these 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women. So, the number of women who can stay upright is:

60% of 25 = 0.60 * 25 = 15 women

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 (riders who can stay upright) - 15 (women who can stay upright) = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel, and the diamond jewel costs $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

Next, we need to find the price of the silver jewel. The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we subtract $400 from the price of the gold jewel:

\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, we need to find the total price for all three jewels. We add the prices of the diamond jewel, the gold jewel, and the silver jewel:

\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is:

\[ \boxed{4800} \]"
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought 45 stamps in all."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Since Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, the difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how long it will take Tom to cover the 75-mile gap at this rate. We can use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

\[ 11 + 3 = 14 \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"First, let's find out the cost per class if Manny attends all 10 classes. The total cost is $60 for 10 classes, so the cost per class is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class} \]

Since $6 is less than $10, Manny can miss some classes without his parents refusing to sign him up again. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Let's say Manny misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class in this case would be:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):

\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 10x \leq 40 \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class would exceed $10. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

- Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers weekly.
- Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers weekly.

Adding these together gives the total weekly production for the two:

\[350 + 700 = 1050\]

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers."

The cost of 3 oranges is $3.30, so the cost of one orange is:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]

Now, we need to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is:

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise.

His original salary is $20,000. A 5% raise on $20,000 is:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:
\[ \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 \]

So, his total monthly salary including the bonus is:
\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his monthly salary by 12:
\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. Each dress pant costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit, so each dress pant costs:
\[ \frac{750}{5} = 150 \]
Since James buys 10 dress pants, the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 150 = 1500 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \]

Finally, we add up the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost:
\[ 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{10800} \]"
"To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to calculate the number of articles each website publishes and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of articles published by the news website:
- The news website publishes 20 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.
- So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is \(20 \times 28 = 560\).

Next, let's calculate the number of articles published by the sister company:
- The sister company publishes 10 articles per day.
- February has 28 days.
- So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is \(10 \times 28 = 280\).

Now, we add the number of articles published by both websites:
- Total articles = articles by news website + articles by sister company
- Total articles = 560 + 280 = 840

So, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is 840."

"First, we need to determine how much flour is in one bag. The problem states that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, with each portion being 2 kilograms. So, the total amount of flour in one bag is:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, the total amount of flour in three bags is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each of them biked separately and then add those distances together.

First, let's calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Alisa biked = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance Stanley biked = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance biked by both:
Total distance = Distance Alisa biked + Distance Stanley biked
Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"First, let's calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the soil. He digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil, so the time to dig through the soil is:

\[ \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Bill to dig through the clay. He digs at half the speed through clay, which is:

\[ \text{Speed through clay} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay, so the time to dig through the clay is:

\[ \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates, which makes a total of 27 people. Since he wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, that means he needs 2 cupcakes per person.

To find out the total number of cupcakes, we multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes per person:

27 people * 2 cupcakes/person = 54 cupcakes

Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Fishio initially received 2000 likes.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is \(2000 \times 70 = 140000\).
3. Recently, she received 20000 more likes. So, the total number of likes now is \(140000 + 20000 = 160000\).

Therefore, the final number of Instagram likes is 160000."
"First, let's calculate the total cost Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the voucher was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final amount she paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

The price per pomegranate on Wednesday was $30, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount she paid was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"First, let's find out how much Ariadne made from selling green hats in the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the amount she earned from green hats. So, the sales from green hats would be:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne made $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats, which totals:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month would be:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 900 \]

Now, to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the sales from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount she made in two months is:

\[ 2100 \]"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second hour is twice that, so it costs $15 * 2 = $30. The third hour is also twice the first hour, so it costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, we add up the costs:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $30 (third hour) = $75.

So, James paid $75."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 this week. The difference in her bank account is $420 - $200 = $220. If her weekly wage should be $300, and she only has $220 in her account, then the amount withheld from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

Final numerical answer:
80"
"Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, then each guest will need:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 1.5 \text{ eggs per guest} \]

With 16 guests, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 1.5 \text{ eggs/guest} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Since eggs are often sold in dozens, we convert 24 eggs to dozens:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs."
"Shiela has to write a 15-page research paper. She has finished 1/3 of it.

First, we calculate 1/3 of 15 pages:
15 * (1/3) = 5 pages

So, Shiela has written 5 pages.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
15 - 5 = 10 pages

Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

200 pages ÷ 10 pages/day = 20 days

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the plane. The plane cost $150,000.

Next, we calculate the monthly cost for the hanger. James pays $5000 a month for the hanger.

The cost of fuel per month is twice the cost of the hanger, so:
\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Now, we add the monthly costs for the hanger and fuel:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

This is the total monthly cost for maintaining the plane. To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 15000 \times 12 = 180000 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the plane to the annual maintenance cost:
\[ 150000 + 180000 = 330000 \]

So, the total cost for the first year is:
\[ 330000 \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. It took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
3. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

From point 1, we know:
- Time to cook rice = 30 minutes.

From point 2, we can calculate the time to cook pork:
- Time to cook pork = Time to cook rice + 20 minutes
- Time to cook pork = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
- Time to cook pork = 50 minutes.

From point 3, we need to find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
- Combined cooking time of pork and rice = Time to cook pork + Time to cook rice
- Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 50 minutes + 30 minutes
- Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 80 minutes.

Now, we can find the time to cook beans:
- Time to cook beans = Half the combined cooking time of pork and rice
- Time to cook beans = 80 minutes / 2
- Time to cook beans = 40 minutes.

Finally, we add up the cooking times for all the food:
- Total cooking time = Time to cook rice + Time to cook pork + Time to cook beans
- Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
- Total cooking time = 120 minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the first mixture is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the second mixture is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find 20% of $5:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]

So, the more expensive brand costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day. Therefore, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for the week.

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2.

Adding the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \]

So, the total cost is:

"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought, excluding the apple pie.

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each:
   \[
   2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
   \]

2. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.

3. He bought a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
\]

Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
\[
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
\[
\boxed{7.00}

"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

So, let's do the math:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"First, let's calculate the total hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so each week he spends:

\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since the class lasts for 6 weeks, the total hours spent in the class is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

"First, we need to find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. Since 60% of the teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we calculate Rayna's money as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally, we divide the total money by 3:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"The game has 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- Christina had 30 days of mood records.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- Her first 8 days were good.
- Her next 8 days were bad.
- Her following 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, let's see how the mood distribution fits with the given sequence:
- First 8 days: 8 good days

"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Sally has \( x \) books.
2. According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, Janey has \( 2x + 3 \) books.
3. We know that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 21 \).
4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 18
   \]
5. Next, divide both sides by 2:

"First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in 12 days.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, making the total number of toys 4 + 8 = 12.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubles. So, the new number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys. Now, the total number of toys is 12 + 12 = 24.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs leave the shelter. So, the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21. This means James no longer needs 3 toys, so the total number of toys he needs is 24 - 3 = 21.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21."
"First, let's calculate Dylan's investment. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount of $1200.

"First, let's find out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, we can say:

\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can say:

\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

Now, let's find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can say:

\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they have by adding up the cookies each person has:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

So, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is given by:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

"In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. So, in ""turtle"" mode, he mows \(\frac{1}{60}\) of the lawn per minute.

In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, in ""rabbit"" mode, he mows \(\frac{1}{40}\) of the lawn per minute.

Today, Chris mowed half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, we calculate the time it took to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
\[
\text{Time in ""turtle"" mode} = \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{60} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it took to mow the other half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
\[
\text{Time in ""rabbit"" mode} = \frac{1}{2} \div \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding these two times together gives the total time Chris spent mowing the lawn:
\[
30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is:
\[
50 \text{ minutes}

"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, they have spent a total of 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

To find out how much time they have left, we subtract the time they have already spent from the total time they have:

30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

So, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4
- 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, which is 2 * $2 = $4
- 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, which is 2 * $3 = $6

To find the total, we add these amounts together:
$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda baked. Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, and Greta baked 30 cookies, Celinda baked \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies.

Next, we add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda to find the total number of cookies baked. So, \(30 + 60 = 90\) cookies in total.

Now, the pair eats 10 of the cookies. So, we subtract the 10 cookies they ate from the total number of cookies. Therefore, \(90 - 10 = 80\) cookies are left in the box.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
80

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) because one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin is the same. Let's denote the age of each twin as \( y \).

The combined ages of the four individuals (one twin, one triplet, and the other two triplets) are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ y + (x + 7) + x + x = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ y + 3x + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ y + 3x = 37 \]

We need to find the value of \( y \). To do this, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 37 - 3x \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) are ages, they must be positive integers. Let's test some values for \( x \):

If \( x = 9 \):
\[ y = 37 - 3(9) = 37 - 27 = 10 \]

So, if the younger triplet is 9 years old, the older triplet is \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) years old, and the twins are 10 years old each. Let's check the combined ages:
\[ 10 + 16 + 9 + 9 = 44 \]

The combined ages match the given information. Therefore, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's add up the time John needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. We need to convert this to minutes:
3 hours = 3 × 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we subtract the time John needs for homework from the total time he has:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

100"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the candies. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so each candy costs $3.20 / 4 = $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost $0.40 * 10 = $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, 10 candies will cost $0.80 * 10 = $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies to find the total cost. So, $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00.

The final numerical answer is:
$12.00"
"First, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves each month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong, who saves 20 coins each month.

Neil's monthly savings:
\[ 20 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins each of them has saved after 10 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over 10 years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings after 10 years:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \]

Neil's total savings after 10 years:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, so the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Let the total bill be \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, the cost of the heartworm check is:

\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:

\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"First, let's find the cost of each type of fruit per piece:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so a banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1.
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so an orange costs $1 * 3 = $3.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- For bananas: 5 bananas * $1 per banana = $5.
- For apples: 12 apples * $0.5 per apple = $6.
- For oranges: 7 oranges * $3 per orange = $21.

Finally, let's add up the costs to find the total price for the crate:
- Total price = $5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $32.

The price for such a crate of fruit is $32."
"First, let's find out how many squares of each color Brittany's comforter has.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, let's add up all the squares:
\[14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is the total number of squares, which is 68 square feet.

Final answer:
68"
"First, let's figure out how many regular chairs Mia's restaurant currently has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

So, there are currently 40 regular chairs.

Next, we need to determine the total number of chairs required for the function. There will be 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get. She currently has 40 regular chairs and 8 high chairs, which together total:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs she needs, we subtract the number of chairs she already has from the total number of chairs required:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

50 deer * 50% = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

25 bucks * 20% = 5

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks. 

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the points collected by each student:

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + 0.30 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points. Betty has 3 times more points than Tom, so we can check:
   \[
   65 = 3 \times (30 - x)
   \]
   But we already know Betty's points are 65, so Tom's points are 30.
4. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Martha's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. So, the points the class is missing are:

"To find out how many great-grandbabies will be at the family reunion, let's break it down step by step.

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her children has 3 children of their own (grandchildren). So, the total number of grandchildren is:
   \[
   3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren}
   \]
3. Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (great-grandbabies). So, the total number of great-grandbabies is:
   \[
   9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"First, let's calculate how much Greta puts into her retirement account. She puts 50% of her $2400 paycheck into her retirement account.

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, we calculate how much she uses for her monthly car payment. She uses 20% of her paycheck for this.

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and used for her car payment from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left to spend.

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."

"First, let's calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, we multiply 15 by 20:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Hannah's house is at an angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see from the city, we calculate 40% of 300:

\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. She is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. So, we multiply 3 by 5:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks from the city and the fireworks from her backyard:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"First, let's find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20 people

Each person saves a seat and gets two drinks and three snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks as follows:

For drinks: 20 people * 2 drinks/person * $2/drink = $80
For snacks: 20 people * 3 snacks/person * $2/snack = $120

Now, we add the cost of drinks and snacks together to find the total amount spent:

$80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200

So, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks."
"Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul:

4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

Together, the three trucks can haul 11,600 pounds. We know Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul:

4,000 (Gissela) + 4,800 (Gordy) = 8,800 pounds

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the total of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the combined total:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"First, we need to divide $100 in the ratio 3:2 between Gerald and Julia.

The total parts in the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

So, Gerald gets 3 parts, which is 3 * $20 = $60.

"First, we need to find out how much more money the firefighters need to raise to reach their goal. They need to raise $6300 in total and have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount is:

$6300 - $2100 = $4200

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take to raise the remaining $4200, assuming they raise the same amount each hour as they did in the first 3 hours. In the first 3 hours, they raised $2100, so they raised:

$2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours gives us the total hours needed:

3 hours + 6 hours = 9 hours

"First, let's find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city. The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, we calculate:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \]

This means 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by the city.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage for non-industrial purposes is:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in 48 hours, we first need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, the rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, the rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, let's assume the factory produces only chocolate ice cream for the first part of the 48 hours and only vanilla ice cream for the rest, to maximize the total production. However, since the problem does not specify the production schedule, we can assume the factory can switch between the two types of ice cream freely and we just need to calculate the total production based on the rates.

The total production in 48 hours would be:
- Chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- Vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding these together gives:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is:
\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount from Marcus' loyalty card:
\[
10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00

"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's see how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 if she just buys them without the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 1 free (since 4 scoops means 2 sets of 2 scoops, and each set gives 1 free scoop):
\[ 4 \text{ scoops} = 2 \text{ sets of 2 scoops} \]
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ scoops per set} = 4 \text{ scoops bought} \]
\[ 2 \text{ free scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 5 scoops in total with her $6.00.

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

A week has 7 days, so two weeks have \(7 \times 2 = 14\) days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

Both started with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left, and Amy has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks."
"First, we need to find out how many square feet Mr. Boarden wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom. 

To find two thirds of 36 sq ft, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Next, we know that for every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 sq ft, he would need:
\[ 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries. James paid a flat fee of $20 to go picking and then $1.5 per pound for the blueberries he picked. Since he picked 30 pounds, the cost for the blueberries is:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the flat fee, the total cost for picking the blueberries is:

\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if James had bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The price at the store is $2.5 per pound, so for 30 pounds, the cost would be:

\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store, we subtract the total cost of picking from the total cost of buying at the store:

\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses 2 oz of ham.
   - Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up all the calories:

- Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

"First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga makes with her feet when her arms are not raised. She taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps per minute with her arms not raised is:

\[ 300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 3 minutes with her arms not raised, the total number of taps in those 3 minutes is:

\[ 550 \times 3 = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of taps when her arms are raised. With her arms raised, she taps each foot at 200 taps per minute, so the total number of taps per minute is:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute} \]

Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms raised, the total number of taps in those 2 minutes is:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, we add the taps from both periods to get the total number of taps in 5 minutes:

\[ 1650 + 800 = 2450 \]

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of having the city fix it and the total cost of Ron fixing it himself, then find the difference.

1. **Cost if the city fixes it:**
   - The pothole will do $450 worth of damage to Ron's car if it's not fixed.
   - The city council will not charge Ron for this if they fix it.

2. **Cost if Ron fixes it himself:**
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Ron will also need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - The total cost for the asphalt is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

So, the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole himself is:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Savings:**
   - The savings is the difference between the cost of having the city fix it and the cost of Ron fixing it himself.
   - Since the city fixing it costs $0 and Ron fixing it costs $195, the savings is:
   \[ 450 - 195 = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ron saves \(\boxed{255}\) dollars by fixing the pothole himself."
"The restaurant originally has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. If 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, we can calculate the remaining chairs as follows:

Normal chairs left: \(170 - 20 = 150\)
Baby chairs left: \(23 - 13 = 10\)

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs left:
\(150 + 10 = 160\)

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizzas ordered. Since Bryce and his four friends each ordered one pizza, there are a total of 5 pizzas.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. They each ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. So, for each of these 3 people:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 8 \text{ slices} \]
Since there are 3 people, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 3 \times 8 \text{ slices} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices the other two friends ate. They each ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. So, for each of these 2 people:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]
Since there are 2 people, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[ 2 \times 9 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all the friends:
\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ 18 \]"
"First, let's find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Time for dog} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches gives us the total length of Topher's shoe in inches:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby’s shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed with the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows. Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:

\[ \text{Number of students' cars} = 64 \]
\[ \text{Windows per student's car} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Windows smashed for students' cars} = \frac{1}{4} \times 64 \times 4 = 64 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows. Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:

\[ \text{Number of teachers' cars} = 32 \]
\[ \text{Windows per teacher's car} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Windows smashed for teachers' cars} = \frac{3}{4} \times 32 \times 2 = 48 \]

Now, we add the windows smashed for both the students' and teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:

\[ \text{Total windows smashed} = 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"First, let's find the total number of spools Candy has:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find the number of blue spools:

- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45

Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of her spools are blue."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, there are 5000 people in line.
2. By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by midday is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]
3. The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]
4. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted. So, the number of people who voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]
5. The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he needs for 30 days, we multiply 4 by 30:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces per pack:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

"First, let's calculate the total number of smores needed.

For the kids:
9 kids * 2 smores each = 18 smores

For the adults:
6 adults * 1 smore each = 6 smores

Total smores needed:
18 smores + 6 smores = 24 smores

Each sleeve makes 8 smores, and there are 3 sleeves in a box. So, each box can make:
3 sleeves * 8 smores per sleeve = 24 smores

Since they need 24 smores and each box can make 24 smores, they will need:
24 smores / 24 smores per box = 1 box

Final answer:

"First, let's find out Dora's father's age. Dora is 15 years old, and her father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate her father's age as follows:

Father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Father's age = 30 + 8
Father's age = 38

Next, we calculate Dora's mother's age. Dora's mother is four years younger than her father:

Mother's age = Father's age - 4
Mother's age = 38 - 4
Mother's age = 34

Now, we add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."
"To find out how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people. Greg and his 3 younger siblings make a total of 4 people.

"First, let's calculate the weight of each type of book:

- Math and science books: Each weighs 2 pounds. Since there are two types (math and science), the total weight for these books is \(2 + 2 = 4\) pounds.
- French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
- English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
- History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the books:

- Math and science books: 4 pounds
- French book: 4 pounds
- English book: 3 pounds
- History book: 6 pounds

Total weight = \(4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17\) pounds.

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 17 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, Candidate A got:

Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A. So, Candidate B got:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes is 100. So, the votes for Candidate C would be:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"First, let's find out how many apples Beck has initially. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Next, if Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

And Beck will have:

\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after this exchange. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:

\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube.

For the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

For the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces

For the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:
12 ounces (giant) + 14 ounces (medium) + 4 ounces (small) = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the amount of water left is:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

Peter has 2 ounces of water left."
"Clara has 20 books, which is two times as many books as Steven. So, Steven has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) books.

"First, let's find out the cost of a half-gallon jar. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
- Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) chairs are rented during weekdays.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month:
- There are 2 weekend days in a week.
- In 4 weeks, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
- Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
- So, in one 4-week month, \(8 \times 100 = 800\) chairs are rented during weekends.

Now, let's find the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = chairs rented during weekdays + chairs rented during weekends
- Total chairs rented in one 4-week month = \(1200 + 800 = 2000\)

Since we need to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months:
- Total chairs rented in two 4-week months = \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\)

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."

"First, let's break down the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 is \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

2. **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.

   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) students need size large.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

- XS: 11
- S: 22
- M: 18
- L: 9
- XL: 15

Total number of shirts:
\[ 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \]

"First, we calculate the discount amount by multiplying the marked price by the discount percentage:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract the discount amount from the marked price to find the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, you will pay $133 after the discount."
"First, we need to find out how many songs John has in total from his 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply 300 by 20:

300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we need to find out the total time these songs will last. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours."
"First, let's find out how many people think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people is calculated as:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 40 \times \frac{60}{100} = 24 \]

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
\[ 50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \]

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win.

16"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If 6 Pomeranian girls represent one third of the Pomeranians, then the total number of Pomeranians is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).
3. We also know that the Pomeranians make up two thirds of all Jana's puppies. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of Jana's puppies, then the total number of puppies is \(\frac{18}{2/3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27\).

So, the total number of puppies Jana has is 27."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ava gave to Jayden. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, so:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Now, let's add the money Jayden originally had to the money Ava gave him:

\[ 70 + 45 = 115 \]

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the cost of the camera:

\[ 200 - 115 = 85 \]

So, Jayden needs \(\boxed{85}\) more dollars to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the final numerical answer, we can round to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is:
\[ \frac{1000}{7} \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."
"Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends 3 * $2 = $6.
Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends 5 * $1 = $5.

Together, they spend $6 + $5 + $3 = $14."
"First, we need to find out how many pears George has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we calculate 45% of 200 bananas.

45% of 200 is calculated as:
\[ 200 \times \frac{45}{100} = 200 \times 0.45 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since George has 200 bananas, the number of pears he has is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits George has. This is the sum of the number of bananas and the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is:
\[ \boxed{490} \]"

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60.

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, Ezra will have read a total of:

300 (initial books) + 150 (additional books) = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 books / 2 = 150 books

Together, they have read:

450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's books) = 600 books

So, they have read 600 books altogether."
"First, let's calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday:

- She teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 5 hours, she earns \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an additional $5, so her total for Monday is \( 75 + 5 = 80 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for Wednesday:

- She teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- She earns $15 per hour, so for 2 hours, she earns \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) dollars.
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not get the additional $5.

So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Now, let's add her earnings from both days:

- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30

Total earnings: \( 80 + 30 = 110 \) dollars.

**Final Answer: 110**"
"To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total sales for vanilla scents:
- They sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents.
- So, the total sales for vanilla scents = 5 * 4 = 20.

Next, let's calculate the total sales for fruity scents:
- They sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents.
- So, the total sales for fruity scents = 2 * 8 = 16.

Now, we need to find the difference between the sales of vanilla scents and fruity scents:
- Difference = Sales of vanilla scents - Sales of fruity scents
- Difference = 20 - 16 = 4.

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents."
"First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from the eggplants, so he needs to make:

$135 - $60 = $75

from selling the ears of corn. He has 25 ears of corn to sell, so to find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount he needs to make by the number of ears of corn:

$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Tatiana has for the weekend:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining 9 hours:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours (video games)} \]

So, the time left for soccer is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours (soccer)} \]

To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{hours spent on soccer}}{\text{total hours in the weekend}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony had 50 pencils initially.

First, he gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon:
1/2 of 50 = 25 pencils

So, after giving pencils to Brandon, Anthony had:
50 - 25 = 25 pencils left

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
3/5 of 25 = 15 pencils

So, after giving pencils to Charlie, Anthony had:
25 - 15 = 10 pencils left

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. Since the museum is 150 miles away and he drives at 75 mph, the time to get there is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the trip back home is the same distance and speed, the time to get back is also 2 hours.

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

So, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the time to the museum, the time at the museum, and the time back home:

\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours."
"First, let's calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these series is $6 each, and a normal movie costs $10. So, the cost for the series is:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the movies in series from the total.
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]
   The cost for these older movies is $5 each.
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the points for both Ava and Emma based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( E_b + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level \( E_t + 4 \) seconds later.

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \) (number of enemies)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \) (number of berries)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \) (time left on the timer)

So, the points for Emma are:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the points for Ava are:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Now, we find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:

Adding both parts together:

15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

So, they ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Bob had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.
2. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, so the total number of fish in the pond became \(7 + 17 = 24\).
3. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as \(w\) and the number of orange fish he bought as \(o\). So, the new number of white fish is \(4 + w\) and the new number of orange fish is \(3 + o\).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[3 + o = 2(4 + w)\]
Simplifying the equation:
\[3 + o = 8 + 2w\]
\[o = 2w + 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[o + w = 17\]
Substituting \(o = 2w + 5\) into the equation \(o + w = 17\):
\[2w + 5 + w = 17\]
\[3w + 5 = 17\]
\[3w = 12\]
\[w = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, if \(w = 4\), then \(o = 2(4) + 5 = 13\). The total number of fish bought is \(13 + 4 = 17\), which is correct. The new number of white fish is \(4 + 4 = 8\) and the new number of orange fish is \(3 + 13 = 16\). Since 16 is twice 8, the solution is correct.

The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total distance Andy travels to work in a week. Since he travels 5 miles one way, the round trip is 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days.

Total weekly distance = 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of gas Andy uses in a week. His car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

Gallons of gas used per week = Total weekly distance / Fuel efficiency
Gallons of gas used per week = 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons

Now, we know the price of gas is $3 per gallon.

Cost per week = Gallons of gas used per week * Price per gallon
Cost per week = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

10 * $20 = $200

She also received 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is:
140 * $0.25 = $35

So, the total amount of money she received is:
$200 + $35 = $235

Next, we need to find out how much she spent. She spent 3/5 of the twenties and all the quarters.

The amount spent on twenties is:
3/5 * $200 = $120

The amount spent on quarters is:
$35 (since she spent all the quarters)

So, the total amount spent is:
$120 + $35 = $155

Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is:
$155"

"First, we need to find out the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees.

The difference in temperature is:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood burns and heats the house up by 5 degrees, we need to find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

"First, let's calculate the number of employees after three months. The company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 employees

Adding these to the initial workforce of 200 employees, the total number of employees after three months is:

200 employees + 60 employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees each month is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

Since we need to find the total amount paid after three months, we multiply the monthly payment by 3:

$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
"To find out how long the choir will be caroling, we need to calculate the total time for singing both songs.

First, we calculate the total time for singing ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they will sing it twice.
- So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(150 \times 2 = 300\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the time for singing ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they will sing it once.
- So, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is \(240 \times 1 = 240\) seconds.

Now, we add the times together to get the total caroling time:
- Total caroling time = \(300 + 240 = 540\) seconds.

So, the choir will be caroling for 540 seconds."
"First, let's determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:

1. **Billy's starting hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, Billy's raise:** $0.50 per hour, so his new wage is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, Billy's raise:** $1.00 per hour, so his new wage is $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours of work at his final wage:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Next, let's determine Sally's starting hourly wage:
\[ \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

Now, let's calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours of work at her starting wage:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$10.50 \text{ per hour} = \$210 \]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally:
\[ \$230 - \$210 = \$20 \]

So, Billy will earn \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread. Each loaf costs $2, so:
3 loaves * $2/loaf = $6

Next, let's calculate the cost of 2 bagels. Each bagel costs $1, so:
2 bagels * $1/bagel = $2

Now, let's find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:
$6 - $2 = $4

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels."
"First, let's find out how many points Nikita scored. Half of Pierson's points is \( \frac{278}{2} = 139 \). Nikita scored 11 more than this, so Nikita's points are \( 139 + 11 = 150 \).

Now, to find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add Pierson's points to Nikita's points: \( 278 + 150 = 428 \).

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students. There are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students. So, the total number of students is:

40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students

Since each student plants one tree, the students will plant 1000 trees.

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:

40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:

120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:

1000 trees (by students) + 240 trees (by teachers) = 1240 trees

So, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's say Bubbles buys \( x \) stuffed goats. The total number of stuffed animals will then be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"First, let's calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first part. She plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days. 

Half an hour each day for 14 days is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's calculate the total hours she plays in the second part. She plays 2 hours every day for a week, and there are 7 days in a week.

2 hours each day for 7 days is:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both parts to find the total hours she has played so far:
\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required hours:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Distance traveled by the first car:**
   - Speed of the first car: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second car:**
   - Speed of the second car: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. 

**Final Answer:**
20 miles"
"First, we need to find the total cost of the materials before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, the total cost of the materials is:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on this total cost. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add this premium to the original total cost of the materials to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, the final amount James paid is:

\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade.

For third graders:
- 340 out of 500 passed.

For fourth graders:
- 40 out of 100 passed.

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%.
- Therefore, \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\) fifth graders passed.

Now, let's find the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.

Total number of students:
- \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

Total number of students who passed:
- \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)

The overall pass rate is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students, expressed as a percentage:
- \(\frac{680}{1000} = 0.68\) or 68%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 68%."
"First, let's calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. Let's denote the length of the mosaic as \( L \) inches. The area of the mosaic, which is the product of its height and length, is:

\[ 3 \times L = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea drunk by the students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts. So:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies. 

So, the total number of candies Dale has now is:
100 (initial) + 100 (ordered later) = 200 candies.

Since he has already sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
200 (total candies) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies.

Dale still needs to sell 50 candies."
"Let's calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

- **End of January**: The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- **End of February**: The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- **End of March**: The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- **End of April**: The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- **End of May**: The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.

The number of students at the beginning of the year is 10. By the end of May, there are 320 students. The additional number of students is:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the final answer is:

\[

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide that number by the number of days in a week (7) to find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. So, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked:

- 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Adding these together gives the total number of petals before any are dropped:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

Next, we account for the flowers she drops. She drops 1 of each type of flower:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

Subtracting the petals of the dropped flowers from the initial total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[79\]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of marshmallows used by John and DeSean to make S'mores. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, so together they used:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Next, we need to account for the 3 marshmallows that were dropped on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows that are no longer available is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows in the bag was 35. After accounting for the marshmallows used and dropped, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since John and DeSean are sharing the remaining marshmallows equally, each of them can have:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ marshmallows} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"First, let's figure out how long each person can play with one quarter:

- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- The two friends who are worse than Jack can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes each.
- The friend who is better than Jack can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses in 4 hours (which is 240 minutes):

- Jack: \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters
- Each of the two friends who are worse: \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters each
- The friend who is better: \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters

Now, let's add up all the quarters used:

- Jack: 12 quarters
- The two friends who are worse: \(24 + 24 = 48\) quarters
- The friend who is better: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\)

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces.
2. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance used is also \( z \) ounces.
3. Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces.
4. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar used is also \( s \) ounces.
5. The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil used is \( 2s \) ounces.
6. The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of the amounts of salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. This total is 10 ounces.

So, we can write the equation for the total amount of ingredients as:
\[ s + 2s + z + z + s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]
We can simplify this further by dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2s + z = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil used. To do this, we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \) or vice versa. From the equation \( 2s + z = 5 \), we can express \( z \) as:
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can test possible values for \( s \). If \( s = 1 \):
\[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
This gives us:
\[ s = 1, \quad z = 3, \quad 2s = 2, \quad \text{and} \quad 2s = 2 \]
Checking the total:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10 \]
This satisfies the condition. Therefore, the amount of oil used is:
\[ 2s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil used is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John bought 3 goats at $500 each, so the goats cost him 3 * $500 = $1500.
He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so the cows cost him 2 * $1500 = $3000.
In total, John spent $1500 + $3000 = $4500."
"Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which adds up to 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

To find out how many more cupcakes Paul should buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"First, let's find out how many cars Joe has initially. Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, the number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away some cars. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he remains with is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"First, we need to find out how much money came from the students. The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. There are 20 students, and they raised a total of $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) hours.

So, the total time she walked in the two days is \(8 + 4 = 12\) hours.

To convert the total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

So, \(12 \times 60 = 720\) minutes.

"Hunter initially counted 50 cars. During the first break, 20 more cars entered the parking lot, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

Total number of cars he counted during lunch break:
35"
"First, let's calculate how much John makes in a single cycle. Since each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays $1.20, we can calculate the earnings per cycle as follows:

\[ 5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20 \text{ per task} = \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} \]

Next, we need to find out how much John makes in a day. Since he does 30 cycles a day, we multiply the earnings per cycle by the number of cycles per day:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles} \times \$6.00 \text{ per cycle} = \$180.00 \text{ per day} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:

\[ \$180.00 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260.00 \]

So, John makes \(\$1260.00\) in a full 7-day week."
"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game. 

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from each game: 14 (from the first game) + 4 (from the second game) = 18 points.

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games."
"First, let's calculate the total number of tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

Next, let's calculate the total number of tins of dog food Kimberly bought. She bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \).

Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.

Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."
"First, let's figure out how many of each color egg Cindy has.

1. Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. She has twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"First, let's calculate the refund Milly will receive from Amazon. The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of this amount.

\[ \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = 24 \]

Next, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. The book weighs 4 pounds and needs to be returned 20 miles.

\[ \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \]
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \]
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \]

Now, we can determine how much money Milly will lose by subtracting the refund from the shipping cost.

\[ \text{Money lost} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has:

$40 + $100 = $140

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so the cost for the jeans is:

2 * $30 = $60

She also buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we subtract the total cost of her purchases from the amount of money she had before making the purchases:

$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

First week: 8,000 bars

Second week: Half of the first week, so \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars

Third week: Three times the first week, so \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production.

Total production of the first three weeks: \( 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \) bars

Monthly production: 50,000 bars

So, the fourth week production: \( 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \) bars

- The base installation cost is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
- Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed, which means she needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures installed.
- Each additional item costs $15.00.

Now, let's calculate the additional items:

- Additional mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding these together with the base installation cost:

- Total cost = Base installation cost + Cost of additional mirrors + Cost of additional chandeliers + Cost of additional pictures
- Total cost = $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00
- Total cost = $324.00

So, the final cost for Angela is $324.00."
"First, let's find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

Eva's savings: $20.00
Anthony's savings: $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much more that is, we calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:

40% of Anthony's savings: 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. Therefore, Roy's savings are:

Roy's savings: $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Final answer:
Roy has $42.00."
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours:
8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Adding both parts of his journey together:
32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"First, let's determine the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, then the total time for one kangaroo to cross the highway would also be 18 hours, since they are all traveling at the same speed.

Now, if a kangaroo takes 18 hours to cross the highway, and each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then each turtle will take twice as long to cross the highway. Therefore, each turtle will take \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hours to cross the highway.

Since the question asks how long it will take four turtles to cross the highway, and each turtle takes 36 hours, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is still 36 hours, as they are all traveling at the same speed and crossing the highway one at a time.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]"
"First, let's find out how many dishes each person made.

Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory made:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the dishes they made together:
Kora's dishes (20) + Rory's dishes (40) + Jada's dishes (80) = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

So, together they made 140 clay dishes."
"First, let's calculate the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old one. The original price is $600, and the trade-in value is $200, so the reduced price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Erika now needs $400 to buy the laptop. She has $50 less than this amount, so she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

This $350 includes the money she already had in her purse, the $150 she earned from her part-time job, and the $80 her mom gave her. So, we can set up the following equation to find out how much money she had in her purse initially:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Combining the amounts she earned and received:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ \text{Money in purse} + 230 = 350 \]

To find the amount of money in her purse, we subtract 230 from 350:

\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of slices from the large and small apples.

For the large apples:
3 large apples × 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

For the small apples:
5 small apples × 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

Now, let's add the slices from the large and small apples together:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total number of slices:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

So, the final number of apple slices left is:
15"
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. So, from 3 cows, he gets:

5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. So, he needs:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day more

Since one cow gives 5 liters a day, to get the additional 10 liters, he needs:

10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 more cows

Final numerical answer:
2"
"To find the total length of the glue that is not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{6}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."
"Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which amounts to \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

The hat cost $70, so the change Thea received is \(80 - 70 = 10\) dollars.

**Final Answer: 10**"
"First, let's calculate how much money Craig starts with. Since he has 2 twenty dollar bills, he starts with:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount of money Craig started with to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"First, let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, if Jack's socks are \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = \( 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180 \).

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 8 (students good in English only) = 12 students good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

5 (students good at math only) + 12 (students good at both) = 17 students.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the total time each group needs on stage, including the time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage. Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, the total time for each group is:

\[2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes}\]

The concert is 2 hours long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:

\[2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}\]

We need to subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:

\[120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs to find out how many groups can perform:

\[110 \div 10 = 11\]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

\[\boxed{11}\]"
"Brenda's investment accumulates simple interest at a rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. The original amount is $300.

First, we calculate the interest for one year:
\[ \text{Interest per year} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Since the interest is simple, it will be the same each year. So, for 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 years} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add the total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"First, let's find out how many white shirts have collars. Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, we calculate:

40 white shirts / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars

This means the number of white shirts without collars is:

40 white shirts - 20 white shirts with collars = 20 white shirts without collars

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:

50 floral shirts - 20 floral shirts with buttons = 30 floral shirts without buttons

Now, to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:

30 floral shirts without buttons - 20 white shirts without collars = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.

"First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer will use. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

900 eggs ÷ 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Now, if the farmer sells each tray for $2.5, we can find out the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

30 trays × $2.5/tray = $75

So, the farmer will earn $75."
"First, we need to calculate how many goats Mr. Smith sold from each farm.

From Farm X, he sold 10 goats. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
55 - 10 = 45 goats

From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold:
2 * 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y

So, the number of goats left in Farm Y is:
45 - 20 = 25 goats

Now, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:
45 + 25 = 70 goats

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."
"James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so he buys:

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair

So, on average, he pays $110 for each pair of shoes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- 3 baskets of green food at $25 each: \(3 \times 25 = 75\)

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each, so the cost per basket is \(18 - 2 = 16\).
- For 3 baskets of red food: \(3 \times 16 = 48\)

Now, let's add the cost of the green food and the red food together:
- Total cost: \(75 + 48 = 123\)

So, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"First, we need to find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half would be:

\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, for 45 rooms, the total time in minutes would be:

\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms."

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( Y \) be your age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Y + S + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of all ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + (B - 5) + B + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B - 5 + B + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"First, we need to find out how many glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy. Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so it becomes:
4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount is:
8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and then sum them up.

"First, let's figure out how many badges each person earns in a year.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

"Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's define the number of books each person has:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

We know that together they have 85 books, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]

Next, we need to determine how many 3-ounce boxes of jello Greg will need to make 120 cups. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we can find out how many 3-ounce boxes are needed for 120 cups by dividing 120 by 10:

\[ 120 \text{ cups} \div 10 \text{ cups per box} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $1.25, so for 12 boxes, the cost will be:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\$15.00\) on jello."
"The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost is:

5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

$4000 - $3500 = $500

The seller will give back $500 in change."
"First, we need to find out how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the $400 cost, we calculate:

\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240 per month. Since the total cost is $400, Keenan pays the remaining 40%:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide the monthly amount by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month):

\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: 
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pieces eaten on the third day**:
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Total pieces eaten so far**:
   \[
   24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far."
"First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda. Since 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00, we divide $21.00 by 7 to find the cost of one bottle of soda.

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]

Next, let's find the cost of one bottle of water. Since 4 bottles of water cost $8.00, we divide $8.00 by 4 to find the cost of one bottle of water.

\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. 

\[ \text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water to find the total cost.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"First, we need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost is:

16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left."
"First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. She earned $33 for 3 hours, so we divide $33 by 3 hours to find her hourly rate.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much she would earn after 12 hours. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by 12 hours.

\[ \text{Earnings after 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours."
"Paul starts with 52 marbles and receives 28 more, so he has:

52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

Then, he loses 1/4 of his marbles. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles.

So, he loses 20 marbles. To find out how many he has left, we subtract the lost marbles from the total he had after receiving more:

80 - 20 = 60 marbles.

Paul has 60 marbles left."
"First, let's calculate the points Amy scores from each type of question.

"First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000 by selling these 180 chickens at $50 each. The total revenue from selling 180 chickens at $50 each is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

This $9000 is the total amount of money Isaias will have after selling the chickens, which includes his initial cost plus the $2000 profit. To find out how much he bought the chickens for, we subtract the $2000 profit from the total revenue:

\[ \text{Initial cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold was 32. Since Julie and the boys together sold 32 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold together by subtracting Julie's sales from the total:

32 - 14 = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many each of them sold:

18 ÷ 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

14 - 9 = 5 glasses

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. 

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's find out how much Iris spent on the manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, we calculate:

Manicure cost = $400 * 1/4 = $100

Next, we calculate the cost of the pedicure, which is 3/4 the cost of the manicure:

Pedicure cost = $100 * 3/4 = $75

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent at the spa:

Total cost = Hair cost + Manicure cost + Pedicure cost
Total cost = $400 + $100 + $75
Total cost = $575

So, Iris spent $575 at the spa."
"First, we need to calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling the rope. The rope is 20 meters long and she can sell it for $2 per meter.

So, the total money she will get from selling the rope is:
20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to determine the cost of the new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 per meter, and we need to know how many meters of the new rope Sarah wants to buy. Since the problem does not specify the length of the new rope, let's assume she wants to buy a rope of the same length as the one she sold, which is 20 meters.

So, the cost of the new rope is:
20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Now, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah got from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over:
$40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope is:
$10"
"First, let's figure out Melanie's current age. If in 10 years she will be 18 years old, then her current age is \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) years old.

Let's say in \(x\) years, her age will be 24. Since she is currently 8 years old, in \(x\) years she will be \(8 + x\) years old. We set this equal to 24 to find \(x\):

\[8 + x = 24\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[x = 24 - 8\]
\[x = 16\]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"Argo starts with 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

So, the total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

Now, to find out how many toys Argo has left, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number of toys:

200 - 150 = 50 toys.

Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Fridays, they make twice as many as on Tuesdays, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.

So, the total number of chimichangas made on these three days is:
125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas.

"First, we need to find out how many microphones will actually find space to fit in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means 80% of the microphones will be arranged in pairs.

20% of 50 microphones are:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't find any space. This means:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from the 40 microphones that will find space. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:
\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged on the stage is:
\[ 20 \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of birds Jerry counts in each part of the question.

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) birds.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) birds.

Now, we add all these numbers together to find the total number of birds Jerry counts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"Lani started with 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies, so she had:

Each jar had 10 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals for the orchids is:

\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies. Joelle has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals for the daisies is:

\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the total number of petals of the orchids from the total number of petals of the daisies:

\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. 

Final answer:

"First, let's find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of 100 plants are indoor plants, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 indoor plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after removing the indoor plants:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]

These 75 plants are either outdoor plants or flowering plants. Two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

So, there are 50 outdoor plants. The rest of the plants are flowering plants:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 flowering plants. To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total 100 plants:

\[ \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants."
"A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. So, a thingamabob spins at:

\[ \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. So, \( K = 3J \).
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. So, \( A = 5J \).

We also know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing Joe's lawn is \( 6J \).

The total earnings from mowing lawns over the two weeks is the sum of the earnings from Joe's, Kamala's, and Alba's lawns:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K = 3J \) and \( A = 5J \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha's total earnings from selling lemonade and mowing lawns last month was $80. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

We need to find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales. To do this, we need to determine the value of \( J \). However, the problem does not provide the exact value of \( J \), but we can express \( L \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

Since the problem does not give us the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can't determine \( J \) directly. But we can still find \( L \) if we assume the simplest case where \( J = 1 \) (the smallest possible value for \( J \)):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"First, let's find out Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight of 55 kg.

Carl's weight = Martin's weight + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg
Carl's weight = 71 kg

Next, we find Christian's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so we add 8 kg to Carl's weight of 71 kg.

Christian's weight = Carl's weight + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg
Christian's weight = 79 kg

Finally, we find Harry's weight. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight of 79 kg.

Harry's weight = Christian's weight - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 79 kg - 5 kg
Harry's weight = 74 kg

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"First, let's calculate how much John earns from renting his car each month.

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total hours he rents his car out each month is:
\[ 10 \text{ times} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting his car each month are:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750 \]

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his total earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is:
\[ \$750 - \$500 = \$250 \]

Therefore, John's profit from renting his car each month is:
\[ \$250 \]"
"First, let's figure out how many notebooks Martha originally had. Since Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, she must have originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Therefore, Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of Joseph's notebooks from Martha's:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

"Dijana rowed for 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles. So, Anis rowed \(50 + 10 = 60\) miles.

The total distance both of them rowed is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

So, the total distance they rowed is 110 miles."
"First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4 cookies. So, we subtract 4 from 100:

100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews:

96 ÷ 6 = 16 cookies

So, each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies. 

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more than what Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

So, the total pages read by Denise are \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

Daniel read 0 pages today, so his total is still \(13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract Daniel's total from Denise's total: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"Calvin's pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since Calvin and his wife are adults, they will each have 1 bowl, which is equivalent to 2 adult bowls in total. This means the pot can serve 2 adult bowls and 6 child's bowls (since 8 - 2 = 6).

If each child gets 1 bowl, and there are 2 children, they will need 2 bowls in total. This leaves 4 bowls for the children from the leftover soup (6 - 2 = 4).

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover bowls by the number of children: 4 bowls / 2 children = 2 bowls per child.

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, we can calculate the material needed for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- So, for 1 small mask, she needs \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she needs \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- So, for 1 large mask, she needs \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she needs \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

First, let's find the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. Since there are 9 movies and she saw each one 3 times, we multiply 9 by 3:

\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]

So, Deepa saw the movies 27 times, which means she bought 27 tickets.

Next, we need to find the average price per ticket. We do this by dividing the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is:

\[ 8 \]

Therefore, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"First, let's figure out how many hours Harold works and walks his dog each day.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works:
10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total hours he spends on these activities:
8 hours (working) + 1 hour (walking his dog) = 9 hours

Harold has 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time he has left, we subtract the hours he spends working and walking his dog from the total hours in a day:
24 hours - 9 hours = 15 hours

So, Harold has 15 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and uses 3, so he has:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

He starts with 9 red shoe boxes and uses 1/3 of them, so he uses:
9 * (1/3) = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, he has:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, the final number of shoe boxes left is:
4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoe boxes."
"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, so Joseph originally had \(9 \times 2 = 18\) books. Joseph lost 2 of them, so he currently has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Dean gives 1/5 of his 30 marbles to Jamie, so:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Next, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Now, we need to calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving some to Jamie and Donald. Initially, Dean has 30 marbles. After giving away 6 marbles to Jamie and 10 marbles to Donald, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 30 - 6 - 10 = 14 \]

So, the final number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ 14 \]"
"Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52. 

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. Therefore, Adam's current age is:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first calculate twice Farmer Brown's farm:
2 * 200 = 400 acres.

Then we add 100 acres to that:
400 + 100 = 500 acres.

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres both farms have together, we add Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms:
200 + 500 = 700 acres.

The two farms have a total of 700 acres together."
"First, let's figure out how many packages Colby completes per hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we calculate:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

40 packages/hour * 8 hours = 320 packages

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns. He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, we multiply the number of packages by the payment per package:

320 packages * $0.20/package = $64

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"First, let's figure out how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. So, the time for an extreme sudoku is:

\[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every half hour, we need to find out how many half hours are in 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so half an hour is 30 minutes. Therefore, the number of half hours in 180 minutes is:

\[ \frac{180}{30} = 6 \]

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"First, we need to calculate the total miles Jon drives in a month. Since he drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, we can calculate the total miles as follows:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many tune-ups Jon's car will require. Since a tune-up is needed every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so he works \(5 \times 2 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

In all these three days, Bruce works \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Julia and Nadine bought.

1. The cake costs $11.
2. The balloons: Since 1 dozen is 12 balloons and they are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The ice cream: They bought 2 tubs for $7 each, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each one had:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

"First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since there are 6 students playing tennis and twice that number playing volleyball, we calculate:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 students playing volleyball.

Next, we need to find out how many students are playing soccer. The problem states there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so we add these together:

\[ 16 + 22 = 38 \]

Now, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:

\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

So, the total number of students is:

\[ 56 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class. Since there are 30 students and each sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha collects one shell every month. From age 5 to 10, she collects shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, she collects shells for 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months. Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

60 shells"
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides these into 3 rows, so each row has:

27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. This means that in each row, the cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea.

So, in each row, the number of mint tea cups is:

9 cups / 2 = 4.5 cups

Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks up per trip if he wants to collect 24 berries in total. Since he makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, we need to determine how much water is in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is left in the tank after 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water that will be used in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting this from the initial amount of water in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"

1. **Calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10.
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times \$10/\text{movie} = \$50
     \]
   - Colby has already seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7.
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times \$7/\text{movie} = \$56
     \]
   - Colby has already had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8.
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times \$8/\text{tub} = \$16
     \]
   - Colby has already had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2.
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times \$2/\text{box} = \$8
     \]
   - Adding all these expenses together:
     \[
     \$50 + \$56 + \$16 + \$8 = \$130
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount Colby has to spend:**
   - Colby has $150 to spend each month.
     \[
     \$150 - \$130 = \$20
     \]

3. **Determine how many more movies Colby can see:**
   - It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday, so the tickets cost $10 each.
   - Colby wants to buy a tub of popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost:
     \[
     \$8 + \$2 = \$10
     \]
   - After buying the popcorn and candy, Colby will have:
     \[
     \$20 - \$10 = \$10

"First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so it has \(600 \div 3 = 200\) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so it has \(450 \div 3 = 150\) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \(300 \times 150 = 45,000\) calories.

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories = \(40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000\) calories.

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
85,000 calories."
"First, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs Rita removed over the week.

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day. For both days, that's \(78 + 78 = 156\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs removed:

\[ 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 \]

First, add 39 and 156:

\[ 39 + 156 = 195 \]

Next, add 48:

\[ 195 + 48 = 243 \]

Finally, add 57:

\[ 243 + 57 = 300 \]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[ \frac{300}{5} = 60 \]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"First, let's calculate the distance traveled by the bus. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance is:

\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled by the car. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:

\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys.

Here are the numbers of each type of toy:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
31 (building blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we know that the total number of toys is 62. So, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: 
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, we substitute the expression for \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute the expressions for \( P \) and \( Pa \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

- Total distance spat by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, let's find the total distance spat by both:
- Total distance = Distance spat by Zoey + Distance spat by Sydney
- Total distance = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average total distance spat:
- Average distance = Total distance / Number of participants
- Average distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"First, let's figure out how many widgets each machine makes in a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets an hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.

Now, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month with 30 days.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- In 30 days, it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Revenue = \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Revenue = \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

Finally, we find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Difference in revenue = \(259200 - 194400 = 64800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) dollars more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for 17 hours.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for 24 hours:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron pays for the first 12 hours and then adds 70 pesos for each additional hour:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- The number of additional hours is \(17 - 12 = 5\).
- The cost for the additional hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.

So, the total cost for 17 hours is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, let's find out how much Cameron would save by choosing the second option:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

"First, let's figure out how much hay each sheep needs. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. So, each sheep needs \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Next, we calculate the total hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds, so the total hay for the goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.

Then, we calculate the total hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each needs 7 pounds, so the total hay for the sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.

Finally, we add the hay needed for the goats and the sheep to get the total hay needed. So, the total hay needed is \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so:

\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to subtract the 50 dollars he spent on gas from his earnings:

\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so we subtract that from his remaining money:

\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he buys 5 pencils:

\[ 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} \times 5 \text{ pencils} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to determine how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is:
\[ 56 \text{ children per school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons. Since each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice and she has 9 coupons, the total number of bottles is:

\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students and each student gets 2 bottles, so the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:

\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof, we calculate the labor charge as follows:
   \[
   2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$78.75
   \]
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[
\$40 + \$78.75 + \$60 = \$178.75
\]

So, the total charge for the job is:
\[
\boxed{178.75}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. James gets 10 CDs, and each CD costs $15.

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount. A 40% discount means James pays 60% of the original price.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.60 \times \$150 = \$90 \]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

Now, James decides he doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 each.

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Since he sold the CDs for more than he paid for them, we need to subtract the amount he received from the total amount he paid.

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. In this case, he didn't lose any money; instead, he gained $110.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how much Jen will earn, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then add them together.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \) dollars.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) dollars.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \) dollars.

Now, we add the earnings from all the root crops together:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, Jen will earn a total of $34."
"First, let's calculate the distance James swims before resting. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is:

\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes him to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, his rest time is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he has to swim the remaining 8 miles (since \(20 - 12 = 8\)). His speed for the remaining distance is half of his original speed, which is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we add up all the times: the time to swim the first part, the rest time, and the time to swim the second part:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has based on the information given.

The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. 

If Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, then seven times that amount would be:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

Final answer:
450"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left. Then her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so she ended up with 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

"First, let's calculate the commission Cayley earns from selling the New York Times.

- Each New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.
- His commission is 10% of the price of each copy.

So, the commission from one New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \]

For 6 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the commission from selling the Wall Street Journal.

- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.
- His commission is 8% of the price of each copy.

So, the commission from one Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \]

For 10 copies, the total commission is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12.00 \]

Finally, we add the commissions from both newspapers to get the total commission:
\[ 3.00 + 12.00 = 15.00 \]

So, the total commission Cayley earns is:
\[ 15.00 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (the total points scored by the team)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \)
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \)

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back to find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"If the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, then the total number of pages is:

"First, let's figure out how many hours Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours in total.

Now, we need to convert those hours into 15-minute intervals because that's how fast Vince staples. There are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour (since 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4).

So, in 15 hours, there are 15 hours * 4 intervals/hour = 60 intervals.

Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, in 60 intervals, he staples 30 reports/interval * 60 intervals = 1800 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether."
"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time from when she went to sleep until she woke up, and then subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. The usual sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
2. Convert 8 hours into minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.
3. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.
4. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.
5. Calculate the total time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.:
   - From 10 p.m. to midnight (12 a.m.) is 2 hours, which is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - From midnight to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes, which is \(5 \times 60 + 55 = 300 + 55 = 355\) minutes.
   - Total time from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \(120 + 355 = 475\) minutes.
6. Subtract the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes) from the total time (475 minutes) to find out how many minutes she slept on her bed:
   \(475 - 23 = 452\)

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day."
"First, let's find out how many measuring cups Jonathan has. Since he has two dozen cups, and one dozen equals 12, he has:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many measuring spoons he has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Now, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 \text{ measuring cups} + 10 \text{ measuring spoons} = 34 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital:

1/5 of 1000 beds are occupied, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds occupied} \]

This means the number of unoccupied beds is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

Next, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:
\[ 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Now, we need to determine the total number of unoccupied beds after these 700 patients are admitted. Initially, there are 800 unoccupied beds, and 700 patients are admitted, so:
\[ 800 - 700 = 100 \text{ unoccupied beds} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.

Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:
16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family:
\(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\) emails to family.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:
9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend:
\(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\) email to her boyfriend.

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend."
"First, we need to find out how old Shawna is. Since Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

Shawna's age = 3 (Aliya's age) × 3 = 9 years old.

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we can calculate his age as:

Shawna's father's age = 9 (Shawna's age) × 5 = 45 years old.

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney reported 120% of the actual number, which is 48.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Jeffrey carried \( x \) balls.
2. Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jason carried \( 2x \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by Jeffrey, Jason, and Jordan. According to the problem, if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then we can set up the equation for \( x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried \( x = 1 \) ball, Jason carried \( 2x = 2 \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4x = 4 \) balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes
   - Total holes dug by the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 8 = 31\) holes

2. **Account for the holes filled in:**
   - Holes filled in on the third day: 2 holes
   - Total holes after filling in: \(31 - 2 = 29\) holes

3. **Determine the number of holes by the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.
   - Holes at the end of the first day: 10 holes
   - Four times the holes at the end of the first day: \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes

4. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - Holes at the end of the fourth day: 40 holes
   - Holes at the end of the third day: 29 holes
   - Holes dug on the fourth day: \(40 - 29 = 11\) holes

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. So together, they got:

70 + 70 = 140 corn chips.

Collins got 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, which means Collins got:

70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips each person got:

140 (Amora and Lainey together) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, there were 225 corn chips altogether."
"First, we need to find out how much the travel tickets cost. The problem states that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. The supplies cost $400 in total.

To find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Therefore, the total cost for the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as:
\[ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \]

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) in terms of \( A \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon Stan has caught by substituting \( A = 40 \) into the expression for \( S \):
\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many episodes there are. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:

Number of episodes = 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

Total minutes = 10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles} \)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \( 300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles} \)
- Total distance flown north: \( 36 \text{ miles} \)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[ 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **374 miles**."

"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, Nani's sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

Now, we add up the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
\[8 + 16 + 6 = 30\]

The total age of all three family members is 30."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up all the times:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total. The first two phones are at full price, and each subsequent phone is at half price.

The cost for the first two phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The cost for the next two phones (at half price) is:
2 phones * $600/phone * 0.5 = $600

So, the total cost for all four phones is:

"First, we need to find out how many players are on Zeke's team. Since Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, and Carlton's team has 13 players, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Next, we need to find the total number of players in both teams combined. We do this by adding the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 20 + 13 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ 33 \]"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need \(\boxed{100}\) wooden slats."
"First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes.

So, the number of boxes she has left after giving away is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

Next, she kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself. So, the number of boxes she kept is:
1/4 * 8 boxes = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

So, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is \( 79 \).

Final answer:
79"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these together:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to afford the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we need to determine how many hours he has to work to earn $25. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work 5 hours to afford the books. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Robert has 30 cherries. Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.

The total number of cherries is 60. If Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, together they have \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries. This means Jerry has \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

So, Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

Saturday earnings:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

Sunday earnings:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for two days:
- Saturday + Sunday: $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned $465 for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, she will use:

1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Over 8 days, she will use:

4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Since each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen, the number of bottles she will need is:

32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is:
$160"
"First, let's figure out Emil's age when he turns 24. Emil is currently 19 years old, so he will turn 24 in 5 years.

When Emil is 24:
- He will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- He will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

Now, since this will happen in 5 years, we need to find their current ages:
- Emil's dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, so her sister gave her:
20 (from mother) + 10 = 30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, so her friend gave her:
2 * 20 (from mother) = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add all the beads together:
20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days, we add the amounts from each day: \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

**Final Answer:**
7 servings"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 students = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders/band members = 12 students

So, the final number of students leaving early is:

12 students"
"First, we need to determine the size of Charlie's boots. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's and Sophie wears size five boots, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie wears size 25 boots.

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes together and then dividing by the number of people:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Sophie's boots} + \text{Size of Charlie's boots}}{2} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ 15 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the width of the plants and the space between them are given in feet and inches, we'll convert everything to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 12 inches is 1 foot.

Each plant takes up 1 foot (for the plant itself) plus 1.5 feet (for the space between plants), which totals 2.5 feet per plant.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many plants can fit, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy:

\[ 44 - 17 = 27 \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:

\[ 27 \times 6 = 162 \]

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day. In a week, his brother eats 9 * 7 = 63 pretzels. 

63"
"First, let's calculate the cost for one hanging basket.

For each basket:
- Katherine wants to add 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- She also wants to add 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, the total cost for all the baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to find out how much Jessica sets aside each month for the shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. We divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, let's figure out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we divide 90 by 6:

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp. We know she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, to sauté 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply by 10 minutes:

90 ÷ 30 = 3
3 × 10 = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and cook the shrimp:

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - So, the temperature drop during this period is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **High Speed Cooling:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - So, the temperature drop during this period is \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Air Conditioner:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour without the air conditioner.
   - It was off for 2 hours.
   - So, the temperature increase during this period is \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

4. **Total Temperature Change:**
   - The total temperature drop from cooling is \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
   - The total temperature increase from warming up is \(4 \text{ degrees}\).
   - The net temperature change is \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final Answer:**
14"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Let's break it down:

- For the electric bill, he writes 1 check per month. Over a year, that's 12 checks.
- For the gas bill, he also writes 1 check per month. Over a year, that's another 12 checks.
- For the church, he writes 2 checks per month. Over a year, that's 24 checks.
- For the pest and lawn service, he writes 1 check every quarter (3 months). Over a year, that's 4 checks.

Now, let's add them up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks

So, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of flights the first plane makes in one day. We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and these trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes:
\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many of these 88 trips are to France. According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means that the remaining one-quarter of the flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's add up the total howling time for all three wolves:
\[ 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
\[ \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[ 2 \text{ minutes} \]"
"First, let's figure out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, his father gave him:

\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the money given by his mother and father to find out the total amount of money Adam received from them:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam's trousers cost $30, so to find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"First, let's find the average age of the group. The total age of the children is 20, and there are 4 children. So, the average age is:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is:

\[ \text{Helene's age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene. Akbar is 3 years old, Alessandro is 4 years old, and Helene is 10 years old. Let's denote Wilfred's age as \( W \). The total age of the children is the sum of their individual ages:

\[ 3 + 4 + 10 + W = 20 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 17 + W = 20 \]

To find \( W \), we subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

\[ W = 20 - 17 = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"First, we need to find out the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

The amount collected from neighbors is $500.
The amount collected from the online fund is $1500.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times the amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund. So, we need to multiply the total amount collected by 3:
\[ 2000 \times 3 = 6000 \]

However, before the lawyer makes the donation, Walter's friend also donates $200. This does not affect the lawyer's donation amount, as the lawyer's donation is based on the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund, not on the final total amount.

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ 6000 \]

Final answer:
\[ 6000 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ 50 \]"
"Let's assume the total watermelon is 100 units for easy calculation.

If each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can let the size of each kid's slice be \(x\) units. Therefore, each adult's slice would be \(2x\) units.

Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total slices can be represented as:
\[2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\]

This total must equal the whole watermelon, which is 100 units:
\[8x = 100\]
\[x = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5\]

So, each kid gets 12.5 units, and each adult gets \(2 \times 12.5 = 25\) units.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total watermelon}}\right) \times 100\]
\[\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{25}{100}\right) \times 100 = 25\%\]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on inpatient rounds. He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the appointments. He has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes.

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities.

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 480 minutes to hours.

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. We subtract the 8 hours spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the 9 hours.

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.

"To find out the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours.
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Let's add up the total time required:
- Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Baking: 30 minutes
- Making batter: 20 minutes
- Frosting: 10 minutes

Total time = 120 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find out how many bars are in each box.

First, let's add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. So, the total number of boxes sold is:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we know that the total number of chocolate bars sold is 64. Since these 64 chocolate bars were sold in 8 boxes, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, the number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost per session for the dance studio. The cost per session includes a fixed cost of $25 for renting the studio plus a variable cost of $1.50 per student. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is:

\[ 10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 \text{ per student} = \$15 \]

So, the total cost per session is:

\[ \$25 + \$15 = \$40 \]

The dance studio is rented 3 days a week. Therefore, the weekly cost is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times \$40 \text{ per day} = \$120 \]

Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost is:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times \$120 \text{ per week} = \$480 \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:

\[ \$480 \]"
"First, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. Since Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars, we divide 64 by 4:

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, let's find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. Since Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars, we divide 56 by 7:

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:

16 - 8 = 8

Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"First, let's find out how many female porcupines there are. Since the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50. Adding the number of babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1490} \]"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"First, let's find out how many blue sticks there are. Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, and there are 9 red sticks, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:

Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5
Number of blue sticks = 14

Next, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks:

Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 11

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11
Total number of sticks = 34

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"First, we calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old.

Total students = 3000

Half of the students are over 16 years old:
Over 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500 students

The other half are under 16 years old:
Under 16 = 3000 / 2 = 1500 students

Now, let's find out how many of the students over 16 are male and how many are female.

One-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
Male over 16 = 1500 / 4 = 375 students

So, the number of female students over 16 is:
Female over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125 students

Next, let's find out how many of the students under 16 are male and how many are female.

One-half of the students under 16 are male:
Male under 16 = 1500 / 2 = 750 students

So, the number of female students under 16 is:
Female under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750 students

Now, to find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and the female students under 16:

Total female students = Female over 16 + Female under 16
Total female students = 1125 + 750 = 1875

So, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(14 / 2 = 7\) laps in one hour.

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the second day} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped over two days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{6000}
\]"
"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge Calculation:**
   - After 8 hours, the power bank was at 28% charge.

2. **Charge Before the Second Phase:**
   - For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( x \) be the charge before the last 3 hours.
   - After 3 hours, the charge would be \( x \times (1 - 0.07)^3 \).
   - We know this equals 28%, so:
     \[
     x \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.93)^3 \):
     \[
     (0.93)^3 = 0.804357
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     x \times 0.804357 = 0.28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{0.28}{0.804357} \approx 0.348
     \]

3. **Charge Before the First Phase:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its capacity each hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the charge before the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, the charge would be \( y \times (1 - 0.09)^5 \).
   - We know this equals 0.348, so:
     \[
     y \times (0.91)^5 = 0.348
     \]
   - Calculate \( (0.91)^5 \):
     \[
     (0.91)^5 = 0.624032
     \]
   - So:
     \[
     y \times 0.624032 = 0.348
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{0.348}{0.624032} \approx 0.557
     \]

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **55.7%**."
"First, let's calculate how much Janet earns per hour in total. She earns $10 from wages and $15 from tips, so her total hourly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she wants to save for the down payment. She wants to save 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how much Janet earns in a week. She works 40 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already bought.

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1 each: \(2 \times 1 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining money is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Each plum costs $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

Final answer:
3"
"First, we need to find out the total number of sweets Anne has. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, Anne kept 2 packs for herself. The number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of these 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:

\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:

\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

So, each of her friends received:

\[ 78 \text{ pieces} \]"
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the compound increase formula:

\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \times (1 + \text{rate})^{\text{time}} \]

Here, the present value (initial price) is $120, the rate is 5% or 0.05, and the time is 3 years.

\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

So,

\[ \text{Future Value} = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put in each album. She uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, we divide 72 by 8:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

This means each album has 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 albums were only selfies and 2 albums were only portraits. So, we can find out how many selfies and portraits there are by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

For selfies:
3 albums × 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies

For portraits:
2 albums × 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

Final numerical answer:
27 selfies and 18 portraits"
"First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. Since it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, we can find the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. This gives us:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18 pages:

\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 guests checked in, and the number of guests increases by 30:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

The final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.
He picks 6 bananas on Thursday.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.

To find the total number of bananas John has, we add the bananas picked each day:
4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

John has 22 bananas."
"First, let's break down the quiz into its different types of questions:

- Total questions: 60
- Easy questions: 40% of 60 = 0.40 * 60 = 24
- Average and difficult questions: 60 - 24 = 36
- Since these are equally divided, there are 18 average and 18 difficult questions.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:

- Easy questions: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions.
  - 75% of 24 = 0.75 * 24 = 18

- Average and difficult questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average and half of the difficult questions.
  - Half of 18 (average) + Half of 18 (difficult) = 9 + 9 = 18

Adding these together, the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct is:
- 18 (easy) + 18 (average and difficult) = 36

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"First, let's figure out the price of a large stuffed animal. Since a small stuffed animal costs $4 and a large one costs three times that, a large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let's say Teresa sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The total earnings from the large stuffed animals would be \(12x\) dollars, and the total earnings from the small stuffed animals would be \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars. The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so we can write the equation:

\[12x + 8x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

Dividing both sides by 20, we find:

\[x = 6\]

So, Teresa sold \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\) small stuffed animals.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, so in one week (7 days), he eats \(5 \times 7 = 35\) sandwiches.

The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, so in one week, she eats \(4 \times 7 = 28\) sandwiches.

The son eats 2 sandwiches per day, so in one week, he eats \(2 \times 7 = 14\) sandwiches.

Adding them all together, the family eats \(35 + 28 + 14 = 77\) sandwiches in one week.

"First, let's calculate how much money Suzanne made from selling cookies. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she made:
\[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much money she made from selling cupcakes. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she made:
\[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out her total earnings by adding the money from cookies and cupcakes:
\[ 80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ 320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"The Smith twins found a total of 30 eggs each, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.

There were 100 eggs hidden in total, and if we subtract the 60 eggs found by the Smith twins, we get 100 - 60 = 40 eggs.

Since 10 of these remaining eggs were not found by their friends, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

So, the friends found 30 eggs."
"First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day. 

With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, the additional amount of ore he can mine with a steel pickaxe is:

\[ 12 \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, one dwarf can mine:

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. The total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day is:

\[ 40 \times 18 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For 30 days, the total amount of ore mined is:

\[ 720 \times 30 = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- So, the price per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) dollars.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.5.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- If the price per sandwich is $1.5, then the cost of 8 sandwiches is \( 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \) dollars.

So, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much Tom still needs to pay for the bedroom set after selling his old one. He bought a new one for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

$3000 - $1000 = $2000

Now, Tom has to pay 10% of this remaining amount each month. To find out how much he needs to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

10% of $2000 = 0.10 * $2000 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month."
"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst. Sally started with 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst. So, the number of red balloons that burst is:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
Therefore, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of her 12 yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons released is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
Therefore, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As Sally neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. So, the number of blue balloons she added is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]
Therefore, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is the sum of the remaining red, yellow, and the added blue balloons:
\[ 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

The final number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he doesn't have to turn it in and then subtract that from 100%.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there's a substitute, Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.5\)

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Combined probability: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.2\)

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Combined probability: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.06\)
   - Contribution to the final probability: \(0.06\)

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.76\]

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:
\[1 - 0.76 = 0.24\]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[0.24 \times 100 = 24\%\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"First, we need to find out how many seats are left for guests after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty. The Fine Arts Center has a total of 6000 seats. Subtracting the 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we get:

6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats for guests.

If these 4750 seats are to be split equally among the 950 graduates, we divide 4750 by 950:

4750 / 950 = 5.

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. 

Each graduate receives 5 tickets."
"First, let's figure out how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large ones, and it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, we can calculate the number of medium-sized jelly beans as follows:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 150 medium-sized jelly beans.

Next, we need to determine how many small jelly beans this is equivalent to. We know that 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans 150 medium-sized jelly beans are equivalent to, we multiply 150 by 3:

\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty. She is paid $15 per day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate her total parking expenses. She has to pay $3 for parking each day, and she works for 3 days, so:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes after expenses, we subtract her total parking expenses from her total earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."
"Ted spends 16 dollars on each of the 3 books, so for the books, he spends:

He also spends 6 dollars on each of the 3 pencils, so for the pencils, he spends:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the books and pencils together, the total amount spent is:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many soda bottles Richard will place on the driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he places a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle and then adding 1 (since he starts at the first bottle and places one at the beginning):

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Richard to place the candy in all the bottles. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he needs to do this 8 times (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on until the eighth to the ninth), the total time is:

\[
\text{Total time} = 8 \times 5 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are forty apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we can calculate the total number of apples as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of apples he can make if each pack contains eight apples. We do this by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, the final number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese. Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$11/\text{pound} = \$22 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese. Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$18 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:

\[ \$22 + \$18 = \$40 \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money she started with:

\[ \$50 - \$40 = \$10 \]

So, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:

\[ \$10 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim takes out for college. Since he takes out $50,000 per year for 4 years, the total loan amount is:

\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, let's determine Jim's income before and after college. Before college, he earns $25,000 per year. After college, his income triples, so his new income is:

\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had not gone to college. Since he would have worked for 4 years at $25,000 per year, his total income would have been:

\[ 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000 \]

After college, he will earn $75,000 per year. We need to find out how long it will take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals:

\[ 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 \]

Since he earns $75,000 per year after college, the number of years it will take to earn $300,000 is:

\[ \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \]

So, it will take Jim \(\boxed{4}\) years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces Jim needs. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece will be:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

So, the area of one fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric he needs to buy is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   - Twice Tuesday's delivery: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425
   - Tuesday: 102
   - Wednesday: 209
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of chicken salad + cost of pasta salad
- Total cost = \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **101** dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Loss in the first race: \( -5 \)

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
   - Winning amount in the second race: \( 10 + 1 = 11 \)
   - Win in the second race: \( +11 \)

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Loss in the third race: \( 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \)
   - Loss in the third race: \( -16.5 \)

Now, let's sum up the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: \( -5 + (-16.5) = -21.5 \)
- Total win: \( 11 \)

Net result:
- Net amount: \( -21.5 + 11 = -10.5 \)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

- Average loss per race: \( \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \)

So, the average loss per race is \(-3.5\).

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{-3.5}

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total number of people living in these cities.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities in South America is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, each city has 1000 people living in it. So, the total population of South America is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population of South America, based on the given information, is:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \)."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
   - So, the total number of days is \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked each day:**
   - Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day.

3. **Calculate the total fraction of a day worked over 21 days:**
   - Since each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day each day for 21 days, the total fraction of a day worked by each painter is \(\frac{3}{8} \times 21 = \frac{63}{8}\) days.

4. **Convert the total fraction of a day into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so the total hours worked by each painter is \(\frac{63}{8} \times 24\).

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(\frac{63}{8} \times 24 = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189\) hours.

So, each painter put in 189 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

So, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.

First, let's find the price of the car in 2008:
\[ \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Next, we calculate the price in 2009:
\[ \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times (1 - 0.21) = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12482 \]

Finally, we calculate the price in 2010:
\[ \text{Price in 2010} = 12482 \times (1 - 0.21) = 12482 \times 0.79 = 9847.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is \(\boxed{9847.78}\)."
"First, let's find out how many books are written in English. Since half of the 50 books are in English, we calculate:

50 books / 2 = 25 books in English.

Next, let's find out how many books are in German. Since 10% of the books are in German, we calculate:

10% of 50 books = 0.10 * 50 = 5 books in German.

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

50 books (total) - 25 books (English) - 5 books (German) = 20 books in Spanish.

So, there are 20 Spanish books."
"Bernice drove a total of \(325 \times 4 = 1300\) kilometers in 4 days.

"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Romeo boards a train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
120 + 20 = 140 people

At the second stop, 50 people descend and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people

At the third stop, 80 more people descend:
190 - 80 = 110 people

So, at the final stop, there are 110 people on the train."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. **Tank top**: $10
2. **Running shorts**: $5 more than the tank top, so $10 + $5 = $15
3. **Tennis shoes**: Originally $48, but on sale for half price, so $48 / 2 = $24
4. **Athletic socks**: $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the cost of renovating your kitchen floor, we need to determine how many tiles you will need and then multiply that by the cost per tile.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is 1ft by 1ft, so each tile covers 1 SqFt.
   - Your kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, you will need 200 tiles (since 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - You need 200 tiles.
   - Therefore, the total cost is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"First, we need to find out how much the insurance costs after the increase due to the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

To find the increase:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

For the twins, he needs 4 sheets, and the machine can handle 2 sets at a time, so he does 4 / 2 = 2 loads per week for the twins.

For the king, he needs 1 sheet, and the machine can handle 1 set at a time, so he does 1 load per week for the king.

In total, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 * 52 = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

"First, let's calculate how much food Imma's cats eat in one day. Since she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams each time, the total amount of food per day is:

\[ 60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams per day} \]

Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of food by the daily consumption:

\[ 720 \, \text{grams} \div 120 \, \text{grams per day} = 6 \, \text{days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 6 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices. Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Let's say Donovan's part took \( x \) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \( x + 18 \) minutes. Together, they took 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we have:

\[ x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Let's break down the costs:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: 30 minutes is half an hour, so the cost is $300/half hour = $150
3. Painkillers: 30 pills at $4 each = 30 * $4 = $120
4. Parking: 2 hours at $6/hour = 2 * $6 = $12

Now, let's add them all up:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to find out how many emails James gets in a day that require a response. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 80% of the emails do require a response.

To find 80% of 80 emails:
80 emails * 80% = 80 emails * 0.80 = 64 emails

So, James responds to 64 emails a day.

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. John's score for the first 3 tests: 100 each, so \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\).
2. John's score for the 4th test: 80.

Now, we add these scores together to get the total score:
\[300 + 80 = 380\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of tests to find the average:
\[ \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"First, let's calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.

20 pizzas * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas. This means they have:

20 pizzas - 14 pizzas = 6 pizzas left

Next, let's calculate how many pizzas the football team ate. They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:

20 pizzas * 2 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

40 pizzas * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas. This means they have:

40 pizzas - 32 pizzas = 8 pizzas left

Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:

6 pizzas + 8 pizzas = 14 pizzas

So, the final number of pizzas left is:

"First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony is sending. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small ones, and he's sending 700 small coupons, he will send:

\[ 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so for 700 small coupons, the cost is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so for 1400 big coupons, the cost is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons together:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

"First, let's figure out how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney initially ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so:

10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Next, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had:

7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.

Then, Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches, so he had:

3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is:

6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets the next half pound for free.

Let's calculate the cost:
- For the first pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the third pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- For the fifth pound, he pays $4.00.
- For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

So, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is $18.00."
"First, let's figure out how many people are actually coming to the party. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:

25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members) = 45 people invited.

But 4 people said they couldn't come, so the number of people who will actually come is:

45 (invited) - 4 (couldn't come) = 41 people.

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 people. For each additional person, it costs $6. So, the number of additional people is:

41 (total coming) - 20 (initial free) = 21 additional people.

The cost for the additional people is:

21 (additional people) * $6 (per person) = $126.

So, the total cost of the party is the theater rental fee plus the cost for the additional people:

$125 (theater rental) + $126 (additional people) = $251.

The final numerical answer is:
$251."
"First, let's figure out how much money Maggie and Riza each had originally.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. So, if we let \( M \) be the original amount of money Maggie had, we can write:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. So, if we let \( R \) be the original amount of money Riza had, we can write:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left. Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left. Therefore, the total amount of money they have left together is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"First, let's find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas in total, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
\[ 147 \text{ bananas} \div 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can find the cost of one rose by dividing $15 by 12, which is $1.25. Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

Now, let's add up all the money made from these items:

\(\$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00\)

So, Terry makes a total of \$162.00."
"Let's break down the timing for each train:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
   - Arrival time of the first train: 10 minutes from now.
   - Departure time of the first train: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes from now.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes from now.
   - Arrival time of the second train: 60 minutes from now.
   - Departure time of the second train: 60 minutes from now (it stays for 0 minutes).

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 60 + 60 = 120 minutes from now.
   - Arrival time of the third train: 120 minutes from now.
   - Departure time of the third train: 120 minutes from now (it stays for 0 minutes).

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 120 + 20 = 140 minutes from now.
   - Arrival time of the fourth train: 140 minutes from now.

Paul will wait for his train to arrive at 140 minutes from now. Since he arrives at the station at 0 minutes, his wait time is 140 minutes.

Final answer:
140"
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take her \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's find out how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many jellyfish one spring creates in 4 hours. Since a spring creates one jellyfish every second, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours.

1 hour = 60 minutes = 60 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds

So, in 4 hours:
4 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 14400 seconds

Since one spring creates one jellyfish every second, in 4 hours, one spring would create:
14400 jellyfish

Now, if we have 5 springs, each creating 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs would be:
5 springs * 14400 jellyfish/spring = 72000 jellyfish

So, the final numerical answer is:
72000"
"Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles (since the total distance is 4 miles). He then walked back home, covering another 2 miles. After realizing he forgot something, he walked the 2 miles back to the store.

So, the total distance James walked is 2 miles (to halfway) + 2 miles (back home) + 2 miles (to the store) = 6 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 6 miles by dividing the distance by his speed:

Time = Distance / Speed = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.

So, it took him 1.5 hours to reach the store. 

1.5 hours"
"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from the bunches. Since each bunch averages 4 bananas and she buys 10 bunches, she gets:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if she bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so for 40 bananas, the cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Since she buys 10 bunches and each bunch costs $3.00, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. 

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth per year is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the yearly growth by 13:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"First, let's calculate the number of each type of bike sold.

1. **Trekking bikes**: Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   \[
   \text{Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

2. **BMX bikes**: 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   \[
   \text{BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

3. **MTB bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   \[
   \text{MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
   \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from each type of bike.

1. **Earnings from Trekking bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
   \]

2. **Earnings from BMX bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times \left(\frac{500}{2}\right) = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

3. **Earnings from MTB bikes**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
   \]

Finally, let's sum up the earnings from all the bikes sold.
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales but the truck picks up 3 bales. So, the net increase in the number of bales in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it 8 classes in total. Each class is 40 minutes long.

So, the total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on these days.

First, we find \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his total weekday class time:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent in classes during the weekdays and the extra learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends learning each week is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} \]"
"First, we need to find the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Since Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony and each story is 24 feet high, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, on the first bounce, the ball will reach:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball will reach \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached on the first bounce:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's convert the height of the first child from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the first child, who is 6 feet tall, is:

\[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:

\[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:

\[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:

\[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by 10:

2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag:

200 bags * $5 per bag = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples."
"Let's work backwards to find out how much meat was on the triceratops initially.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kg left.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left before the Allosaurus ate. So, before the velociraptors scavenged, there must have been \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, before the T-Rex ate, there must have been \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms of meat.

Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall.

The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. So, the area of one of these walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"First, let's figure out how many sodas are left after Ellen and her brother take some.

Ellen started with 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them and took 1 unshaken soda for herself. So, the number of sodas left is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Next, Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So, the number of sodas left after her brother takes some is:
\[ 11 - 1 - 2 = 8 \]

Out of these 8 sodas, 2 are unshaken (since Ellen took 1 unshaken soda and her brother took 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 3 unshaken - 1 = 2 unshaken sodas), and 3 are shaken (since Ellen shook 3 and her brother took 1, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas + the 1 unshaken she shook but didn't take).

So, the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 100 = 37.5\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{37.5} \]"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
   \]
   After 3 hours, it will have traveled:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances traveled by each train:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart."
"First, let's figure out the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th. 

March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days. Adding April 1st to April 19th gives us 19 more days. So, the total number of days is:
\[ 31 + 19 = 50 \]

Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, Billy works on:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days} \]

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps each day is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ people per day} \]

Over 40 days, the total number of people he helps is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people that the buses and cars could carry.

First, let's calculate the number of people that the buses could carry:
- There were 12 buses.
- Each bus carried 35 people.

So, the total number of people that the buses could carry is:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people/bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people that the cars could carry:
- There were 20 cars.
- Each car carried 3 people.

So, the total number of people that the cars could carry is:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people/car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add the number of people that the buses and cars could carry to find the total number of people:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is:
\[ 480 \]"
"First, we find out how old Martha is. Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we subtract 4 from 24.

24 - 4 = 20

So, Martha is 20 years old.

Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Since Martha is 20, we add 10 to 20 to find Jeff's age.

20 + 10 = 30

Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time = Length / Speed
Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day.

Each day, Bobby takes:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which is 2 * 15 = 30 minutes

So, each day he spends:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, each day Bobby spends 1 hour on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, the final numerical answer is:
5 hours"
"First, let's find out how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we calculate:

Micah's miles = 3.5 * Amber's miles
Micah's miles = 3.5 * 8
Micah's miles = 28

Now, we know Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 28 miles. Together, they ran:

Amber's miles + Micah's miles = 8 + 28 = 36 miles

Since the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, we can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total:

Ahito's miles = Total miles - (Amber's miles + Micah's miles)
Ahito's miles = 52 - 36
Ahito's miles = 16

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"First, let's calculate the new balance after Sheila returned the item.

She initially charged $85.00 and then returned an item worth $15.00. So, the balance after the return is:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, Sheila bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
\[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

Then, she bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is:
\[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the balance after the return:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is:
\[ \boxed{113.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the total number of jellyfish in the tank be \( J \).
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
4. We know that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

Now, we solve for \( J \):

\[
\frac{J}{15} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 15:

\[
J = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

Final answer:
\[
90

"First, we need to find out how old Ben is. Since Ben is two times older than Chris, and Chris is 4 years old, we calculate Ben's age as follows:

\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Next, we need to find out how old Caroline is. Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, and Ben is 8 years old, we calculate Caroline's age as follows:

\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Caroline is 24 years old. 

The final answer is:

"First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.

\[ \text{Annual Savings} = 100,000 \times 0.20 = 20,000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much she will need for her retirement. She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.

\[ \text{Annual Retirement Expense} = 100,000 \times 0.40 = 40,000 \]

Since she needs to cover 20 years of retirement, the total amount she needs for retirement is:

\[ \text{Total Retirement Savings Needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \]

Now, we need to find out how many years she needs to save $20,000 each year to accumulate $800,000.

\[ \text{Years Needed to Save} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement. 

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"First, we need to find the length of each of the 4 equal parts of the ribbon. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon, and he needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

Each of these 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long. 

The final answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"First, we need to find the total population of the school. If 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times \text{Total Population} = 240 \]

To find the total population, we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ \text{Total Population} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now, we know the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"First, we add the cost of the pots and the garden soil:

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, you need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of heels.

First, calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, add these together to get the total height:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, divide the total height by the number of heels to find the average:
\[18 \div 6 = 3\] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days.

If she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, she would walk:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day} \]

So, Soledad must hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles per day} - 250 \text{ miles per day} = 60 \text{ more miles per day} \]

**So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.**"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total cost for each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Red balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total cost for red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total cost for blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total cost for green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

Now, we sum the total costs for all the balls:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's figure out how much Pierre and Paul want.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

So, the amount of apples left for Jacques is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the temperature became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. Then it increased by 3 degrees, so the temperature became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond started with $21. He saved an additional $11, so he had:

\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent a total of:

\[ 5 + 19 = 24 \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the total amount he had:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left."
"First, let's figure out how much money Anna spent in total. She started with $16 and has $2 left, so she spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

We know she had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books, so the amount she spent on the 2 books is:

\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each book cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students. This year, there's a 20% increase in enrollment. 

To find the increase, we calculate 20% of 50:
20% of 50 = 0.20 × 50 = 10

So, the number of students increased by 10. 

To find the total number of students this year, we add this increase to last year's number:
50 + 10 = 60

This year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes to blink 459 times.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we use this rate to find out how many minutes it takes to blink 459 times:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."
"First, let's count the initial number of each type of fish:

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Next, let's add the new fish Tate buys:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we need to find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:

16 (female fishes) - 11 (male fishes) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume at least 5 hours, but to keep it simple, we'll use 9 as an example).

Now, let's add up the time they all took:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"First, let's calculate the distance to John's parents' place. Since it takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph, the distance one way is:

\[ \text{Distance one way} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since he makes a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{560} \]"
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half of that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in one hour.

- The first two workers produce 6 toys each per hour, so together they produce \(6 + 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 4 toys each per hour, so together they produce \(4 + 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

So, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Next, calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

- In 10 hours, the first four workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to complete the order of 400 toys. This means that the first four workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced the remaining \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

Now, calculate the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

- The fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the number of toys the fifth worker produces per hour is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, we need to find the weight of each of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all the dogs together:
\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is:
\[ 105 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. This means Kris had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers before giving any to Rob.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means the 16 stickers Luis had were the other half he didn't use. So, before using half, Luis must have had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. This means the 32 stickers Luis had were half of what Seth originally had. So, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we calculate the total number of M&M he has:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, we need to find out how many small bags he can make if each small bag contains 10 M&M:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

So, John can make 90 small bags."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance.

First, the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of the circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Next, we know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"First, let's find out how fast the 2nd fastest car can go. Since the average car can go 120 miles per hour and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we calculate:

\[ 120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph} \]

So, the 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how fast the fastest car can go. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So we calculate:

\[ 600 \text{ mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

2. According to the problem, Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
   \[
   A = M
   \]

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
   \[
   C + S = 30
   \]

4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:
   \[
   C = S + 12
   \]

5. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
   \[
   A + M + C + S = 56
   \]

6. Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
   \[
   A + A + C + S = 56
   \]
   \[
   2A + C + S = 56
   \]

7. We know from step 3 that \( C + S = 30 \), so we can substitute \( C + S \) with 30:
   \[
   2A + 30 = 56
   \]

8. Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   2A = 56 - 30
   \]
   \[
   2A = 26
   \]
   \[
   A = 13
   \]

9. Since \( A = M \), Madeline also painted 13 eggs.

10. Now, we need to find the number of eggs Camden painted. Using \( C = S + 12 \) and \( C + S = 30 \):
    \[
    (S + 12) + S = 30
    \]
    \[
    2S + 12 = 30
    \]
    \[
    2S = 18
    \]
    \[
    S = 9
    \]

11. Therefore, Camden painted:
    \[
    C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
    \]

12. Finally, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
    \[
    C - A = 21 - 13 = 8
    \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

200 crayons / 8 crayons per group = 25 groups

Since each group of crayons goes into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is:

25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

To convert ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor 16 ounces to a pound:

400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"First, let's find out how much of the tree can be made into logs. John can make logs out of 80% of the 80-foot tree.

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, he cuts these 64 feet into 4-foot logs. So, the number of 4-foot logs he gets is:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96."
"First, let's find out how much Valerie's brother earns. Since Valerie earns $5000 per month and this is half of what her brother earns, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Valerie's mother earns. Her mother earns twice the combined salary of Valerie and her brother. So, we first find their combined salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, we calculate the mother's salary:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Finally, we add up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and her mother to find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 45000 \]"
"First, let's determine Grandma's speed on the beach. If she spends 40 minutes walking 2 miles on the beach, her speed on the beach is:

\[ \text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:

\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. Since her speed on the sidewalk is \(\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}\), it takes her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.

The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far. She saves $4 every week and has been saving for 8 weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much more she needs to save to reach a total of $60.

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28.

\[ \frac{28 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ dollars/week}} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."
"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we need to add up the birds in each group of trees.

Next, we calculate the number of blue birds in the 2 trees that each had 4 blue birds:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Then, we add the number of blue birds in the final tree, which had 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we add all these numbers together to get the total number of blue birds:

"First, let's find out how many marbles Bob originally has.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles (which is 24 marbles) he will have 60 marbles. So, before receiving these 24 marbles, Bob had:

60 marbles - 24 marbles = 36 marbles

Now, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have:

36 marbles - 10 marbles = 26 marbles

So, the final number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The average temperature of the mixed water can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

First, calculate \( 4 \times 33 \):

\[
4 \times 33 = 132
\]

Now, substitute this into the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Next, solve for \( T \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees. 

\[
\boxed{68}

"Let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Melanie's father has:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. This continues for three weeks, which is 21 days.

So, the total number of cows added in 21 days is:
20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

And the total number of chickens added in 21 days is:
10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, let's add these to the initial numbers:
- Total cows after 21 days: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- Total chickens after 21 days: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the final number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
700"
"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 is:

\[ 40 \times 0.10 = 4 \]

So, the discount amount is $4.00. Subtracting this from the original total cost:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in total. Since each pack has 9 bagels and he orders 4 packs:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36}{36} = 1 \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ 1 \]

Each single bagel will cost $1.00."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Find out how many scoops make up 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes for 2 scoops}
   \]
   \[
   3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops per 3 potatoes}
   \]
   Therefore, 1 scoop of mashed potatoes requires:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} \text{ potatoes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   Since 1 scoop requires \(\frac{3}{2}\) potatoes, 18 scoops will require:
   \[
   18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, let's add the eggs from both periods:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs):
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"First, let's find out how many red jellybeans there are. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, we can calculate the number of red jellybeans as follows:

Number of red jellybeans = 2 × Number of green jellybeans
Number of red jellybeans = 2 × 17
Number of red jellybeans = 34

Now, we know the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. We can find out how many blue jellybeans there are by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:

Number of blue jellybeans = Total number of jellybeans - (Number of green jellybeans + Number of red jellybeans)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - (17 + 34)
Number of blue jellybeans = 60 - 51
Number of blue jellybeans = 9

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar."
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree. So, each year he collects \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons.

**Final Answer: 300**"
"First, let's find out how many men and women were on the bus initially.

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 14 parts (5 + 9) of the total passengers, 5 parts are men and 9 parts are women.

The total number of passengers is 84. To find out how many parts each represent, we divide 84 by 14 (the sum of the ratio parts):

84 ÷ 14 = 6

This means each part of the ratio represents 6 passengers.

Now, to find the number of women initially on the bus, we multiply the number of parts that represent women (9) by the value of each part (6):

9 × 6 = 54

So, there were 54 women on the bus initially.

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

54 - 20 = 34

So, 34 women have remained on the bus.

34"
"First, let's calculate how many sunflowers Faraday sold from the sunflower sales per day. Since each sunflower costs $2 and he earned $26 from sunflowers per day, we can find the number of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower:

\[ \text{Sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

So, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day. Over 3 days, the total number of sunflowers sold is:

\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, after 3 days, Faraday was able to sell 39 sunflowers."
"First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Next, we need to determine how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these rocks. Each rock is sold for $7.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from his initial investment.

\[ \text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scenes separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of days needed for the large-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

Next, let's calculate the number of days needed for the medium-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

Finally, let's calculate the number of days needed for the small-sized picture scenes:
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
- The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Now, we sum up the days required for all the picture scenes:
- Total days = days for large-sized scenes + days for medium-sized scenes + days for small-sized scenes
- Total days = 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes."
"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, three dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

To find out how many eggs each child receives, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

So, 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

Each child receives 9 eggs."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. May has 31 days.

So, the daily cost for food is:
3 fish * $1/fish = $3/day

For the month of May, the cost is:
$3/day * 31 days = $93

Jen spends $93 on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia initially had 30 roses. She gave away 24 roses, so she had:

30 - 24 = 6 roses left.

Then she bought 15 more roses, so she had:

6 + 15 = 21 roses.

Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles initially.
- Then, Sid traveled an additional 140 miles.
- So, the total distance is \(110 + 140 = 250\) miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Sid traveled for 2 hours initially.
- Then, Sid traveled for an additional 3 hours.
- So, the total time is \(2 + 3 = 5\) hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = \(250 \, \text{miles} / 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour}\).

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners.

First, we know the probability of winning with the first ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Next, we need to find the probability that both tickets are winners. Since the events are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's find out how many seashells Carlos collected. Since Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected, Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.

Next, we know Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. So, Carrey collected \(22 \div 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells they collected:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\).

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets \(60 \div 3 = 20\) seashells.

Each person gets 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays, which are 5 days. So, for the weekdays, he eats:
4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, for the weekend, he eats:
5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots from weekdays and weekends together:
20 carrots + 10 carrots = 30 carrots

Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20. He sells each for twice the original price, which means he sells each for $20 * 2 = $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price = $40 - $20 = $20.

Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, so he bought a total of:
2 + 4 = 6 devices.

The total profit from selling all 6 devices is:
Profit per device * Total number of devices = $20 * 6 = $120.

So, the final numerical answer is:
$120."
"First, let's find out how tall Ned is. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, and Isabel is 7 feet tall, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how tall Carl is. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex would have to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each juice bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, Hortex would need to produce 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is \( 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \) bottles.

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The additional number of bottles needed is \( 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \) bottles.

So, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people."
"First, let's figure out how many octuplets are dressed in each color. Since Carla has 8 octuplets:

- 3/4 of them are dressed in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- 1/4 of them are dressed in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how many of the blue-wearers and purple-wearers also wear bows. 

- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

Out of these 4 babies wearing bows, 2 are wearing purple and 2 are wearing blue.

To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearing bow babies}}{\text{Total number of bow babies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%."
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Total reports received last week: 5168
Reports received on Monday and Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday and Friday: 2136

Now, let's subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total:

5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday."
"First, let's calculate how much land Abraham sold for $50. He sold half of his 80 square meters, which is:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. The 1/4 of his land is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

So, he sold 20 square meters for $30.

Now, let's find out how much land he has left after these two sales. He originally had 80 square meters, sold 40 square meters, and then 20 square meters, so he has:

\[ 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters} \]

He then sold the remaining 20 square meters for $3 per square meter, which amounts to:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

\[ 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \]

So, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26 / 2 = 13.

Geb is 10 less than this amount, so Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, he uses:

2 masks/go out * 3 times/day = 6 masks/day

For 2 days, he would use:

6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

Total eggs found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\) eggs.

**9**"
"First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than these 400 apartments. To find out how many apartments are in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:

\[60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

So, the third complex has:

\[400 + 240 = 640\]

Now, let's find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the final answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. So, an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's sum up the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2450
\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and gave Jack 1/5 of it. 

To find 1/5 of $100, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20 \]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20.

Now, we add the $20 that Sophia gave Jack to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, Jack now has $120."
"Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters.
2. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
3. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is \( B + 7 \) centimeters.
4. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
6. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
8. Now, we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. The length of the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"First, let's figure out how much money Rissa and Ronnie initially had.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa had:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Let's say each of them gave \( x \) dollars to their little sister. After giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with:
\[ 15 - x \]

According to the problem, after giving \( x \) dollars, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Solving the right side of the equation:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. Now, let's find out how much money Ronnie has left:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Half of the mural is yellow, so 6 pints are yellow.

This leaves 6 pints for the red, white, and purple paint combined. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide these 6 pints by 3.

So, the amount of red paint used is 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

**2**"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Tom has 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

\[ \boxed{3160} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box has 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

20% of 100 is:
\[ 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find out how many pods you get per dollar, we divide the number of pods by the price:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods per dollar} \]

If you use 1 pod per cycle, then for $1, you can run:
\[ 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match: 6 + 10 = 16 goals.

"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday. 

First, calculate how much chalk was used on Monday:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches} \]

Subtract the used chalk from the original length to find the remaining chalk:
\[ 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher conserves chalk and uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. We need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). The chalk decreases by 80% each day (since 20% is used, 80% remains):
\[ C_n = 2.75 \times (0.8)^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( C_n < 2 \):
\[ 2.75 \times (0.8)^n < 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2.75:
\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} \]
\[ (0.8)^n < \frac{8}{11} \]

To solve for \( n \), we can use logarithms:
\[ n \log(0.8) < \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \]
\[ n > \frac{\log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right)}{\log(0.8)} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \log\left(\frac{8}{11}\right) \approx -0.1461 \]
\[ \log(0.8) \approx -0.0969 \]
\[ n > \frac{-0.1461}{-0.0969} \approx 1.51 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 2 \]

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity, so:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, 4 girls are on varsity.

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's calculate the total number of students on varsity:

\[ 4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \]

The total number of students in the class is:

\[ 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} = 24 \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:

\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 17 \]"
"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many face masks as Mike. Mike bought 5 face masks.

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding 2 more to that, Johnny bought \(15 + 2 = 17\) face masks.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"First, let's figure out how many teeth the dentist caps. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so if he drills 4 teeth, he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

Next, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. The dentist fixes the teeth by drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 teeth.

Now, to find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

The dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth."
"First, we need to calculate how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned because it had passed the expiry date. He purchased 4000 gallons, and 2/5 of that amount was returned.

To find 2/5 of 4000 gallons:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The company sold the milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the refund for 1600 gallons would be:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of:
\[ \$5600 \]

Final numerical answer:

"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7)
\]

Simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Distribute the 3 and 5:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Solve for \( C \):
\[
C = 20

So, Colin is currently \(\boxed{20}\) years old."
"First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. If 100 books cost $500, then the cost per book is $500 / 100 books = $5 per book.

Now, with $27000, the total number of books Bob can buy is $27000 / $5 per book = 5400 books.

Since Bob distributes the money equally among 3 schools, the number of books each school can buy is 5400 books / 3 schools = 1800 books per school.

So, the final numerical answer is:
1800 books per school."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in his pocket.
3. Newton then throws one of the apples in his pocket at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket. He picks up these 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in his pocket.
4. Newton then goes home with all 6 apples in his pocket to make a pie.

So, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out the total cost of Ali's order, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many 50 kg bags are needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"First, let's calculate how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Since Kate has 6 friends, we multiply the number of slices each friend eats by the number of friends:

For cheese pizza:
\[ 6 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

For pepperoni pizza:
\[ 4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For cheese pizza, each pizza is cut into 12 slices. So, the number of cheese pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

For pepperoni pizza, each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizzas together, we get:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy a total of 6 pizza pies. 

Final answer:
\[ 6 \]"
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which is 3 days. So, the total miles for these days is:
3 days * 3 miles/day = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles, which is 2 days. So, the total miles for these days is:
2 days * 5 miles/day = 10 miles

Adding both totals together gives:
9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many snowballs Jay gains and loses in a given time period. Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, 8 snowballs melt in an hour.

So, the net gain of snowballs in an hour is:
\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs. We can set up the equation:
\[ 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} \times t \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ snowballs} \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of years since Digimon's 20th anniversary:**
   - Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, and assuming the current year is the year of the 20th anniversary, we need to find out how many years have passed since its first year.
   - If we assume the first year of Digimon was in 2002 (a common starting point for many anime series), then the 20th anniversary would be in 2022.
   - So, 2022 - 2002 = 20 years have passed.

2. **Determine John's age 20 years ago:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.
   - 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. **Determine Jim's age 20 years ago:**
   - According to the problem, 20 years ago, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - If John was 8 years old, then Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old 20 years ago.

4. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since 20 years have passed, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate, we add up the slices:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

They all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - The nurses used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\) bandages, but since they can't have negative bandages, this means they needed 16 more bandages to meet the demand, so they ordered another bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added \(50 \times 2 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 + 100 - 25 = 109\) bandages left, but the problem states they had 78 bandages left.
   - This means we need to adjust our initial count. If they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, and they had 109 bandages before using 31 (109 - 78), then they must have started with \(109 - 100 + 25 - 34 = 78 - 12 = 66\) bandages before the first day's usage.

So, they started with 66 bandages on the first day.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"First, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so she had 10 - 8 = 2 inches cut off.

The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch, so for 2 inches, it would be 2 * $30 = $60.

The color cost is $40.

So, the total cost for the cut and color is $60 (cut) + $40 (color) = $100.

**Final Answer:**
$100"
"First, let's calculate how many hours Jen works in a week:

\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total hours she works in April:

\[ 45 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her earnings from her hourly rate:

\[ 180 \text{ hours} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$270 \]

Since Jen had complete attendance, she receives an additional $10:

\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

So, the final amount Jen will receive is:

\[ \$280 \]"
"Let's calculate the total money Jason earned step by step.

1. For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he earns $0.50 each time:
   \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \)

2. For doing his laundry once, he earns $3.00:
   \( 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00 \)

3. For taking the trash to the curb twice, he earns $0.75 each time:
   \( 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50 \)

4. For cleaning his room once, he earns $1.50:
   \( 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50 \)

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total money Jason earned:
\( 3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00 \)

So, the total money Jason earned is:
\(\boxed{9.00}\)"
"First, we need to find out how much blood a single shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks as follows:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people entered.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people entered.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

\[50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

To find the total number of pens, we add the number of red pens and black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 75 \]"
"First, let's find the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost of cognac per bottle is 50% more than the cost of scotch. Since the cost of scotch per bottle is $60, the cost of cognac per bottle is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day, which means he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days:

First day: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees
Second day: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

Total trees planted: 60 + 80 = 140 trees

Final numerical answer:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( x \).
2. According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. We can write this as an equation:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]
3. To find \( x \), we first need to isolate the term with \( x \). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   4x = 32
   \]
4. Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"First, let's find out how many fish have red stripes. One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had.

Amy had:
- Two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

So, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

Next, we account for the colors stolen by her sister. Her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\]

Subtracting these 3 colors from the remaining total:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[19\]"
"First, let's find out how tall Mattison's two-story house is. Since his house is 7 times as high as he is, and he is 60 inches tall, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to determine the height of the first floor. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out the height of the second floor. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is:

\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total:

\[ 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for all dogs is 3 miles.
- There are 4 dogs.

So, the total miles for all dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles of the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

Final answer:
4 miles"
"First, we calculate the loan amount John gets by taking 40% of his house value.

The house is worth $250,000, so the loan amount is:
\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. So, we calculate 60% of $100,000:
\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Now, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money John has leftover:
\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:
\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the third tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

So, the total weight is:
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

128 kilograms * $0.50 per kilogram = $64

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"First, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines. Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

To find the selling price, we multiply $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times 1.375 \]

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water removed by the dehumidifier on each setting:

- On the low setting, the dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water removed for each period:

- For 3 days on the low setting: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) liters.
- For 3 days on the medium setting: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) liters.
- For 5 days on the high setting: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) liters.

"First, we need to find the capacity of one of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity for John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The capacity of Ali's school is the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The interest on $300 at 2% is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we calculate how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 each month for 11 months:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he needs to return:

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ 31 \]

Final answer:
\[ 31 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. So, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Since Jordan changes the other half, he changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Effective volume}}{\text{Volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.

3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus now is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. The number of remaining spaces on the bus is:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]
So, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"First, let's calculate the cost of one visit after 5 years. The initial cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the cost is now 250% of the original cost (100% original + 150% increase).

So, the new cost of one visit is:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit is $2. So, the cost for one year is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
For 5 years, the total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased to $5. So, the cost for one year is now:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
For the next 3 years, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs for the first 5 years and the next 3 years, the total amount Pauline spent is:
\[ 30 + 45 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who can try the escape room. So, there are a total of \(4 \times 10 = 40\) students who can try the escape room.

If 8 students can try the escape room at a time, then the number of groups needed is \(40 \div 8 = 5\).

Since each group takes 45 minutes, and there are 5 groups, it will take \(5 \times 45 = 225\) minutes for all students to try the escape room.

**225 minutes**"
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. 

For the tables: 4 tables * $20/table = $80

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will use to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can calculate the pounds of ground beef needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret steakhouse seasoning he will need. Since he adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"First, we need to find the total width of the windows. Since there are five windows and each window is 35 inches wide, we multiply 35 inches by 5.

35 inches/window × 5 windows = 175 inches

Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches × 2 = 350 inches

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"For the first 16 minutes, the cost is 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00.

The remaining minutes are 36 minutes - 16 minutes = 20 minutes.

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00.

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
- Let \( b \) be the number of brownies Carly makes.

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ b = 3c - 2 \]

Next, we know that Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ c + b = 10 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( c \):
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c = 12 \]
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount.

The cost of a basic manicure is $35, and the cost of a basic pedicure is $40. With a 20% discount on both, we calculate the discount amount and then the final cost.

For the manicure:
- Discount amount = 20% of $35 = 0.20 * $35 = $7
- Cost after discount = $35 - $7 = $28

For the pedicure:
- Discount amount = 20% of $40 = 0.20 * $40 = $8
- Cost after discount = $40 - $8 = $32

Now, let's add the cost of nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, which means 10 nails on each hand (assuming a standard set of nails).

Cost of nail art for one hand = $3 * 10 = $30
Cost of nail art for both hands = $30 * 2 = $60

Now, we add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure with the cost of nail art:

Total cost = Cost of discounted manicure + Cost of discounted pedicure + Cost of nail art for both hands
Total cost = $28 + $32 + $60 = $120

So, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"First, let's calculate the number of issues Susan gets from each magazine type.

For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year:
\[ 3 \text{ magazines} \times 12 \text{ issues/magazine} = 36 \text{ issues} \]

For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
\[ 1 \text{ magazine} \times 6 \text{ issues/magazine} = 6 \text{ issues} \]

For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
\[ 4 \times 6 \text{ issues} = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add up all the issues:
\[ 36 \text{ issues} + 6 \text{ issues} + 24 \text{ issues} = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, Susan gets a total of 66 issues every year. However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the number of issues. She has 3 magazines of one type, 1 magazine of another type, and 1 magazine of the third type, which totals:
\[ 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ magazines} \]

Final answer:

"Samantha has 27 paintings. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's number of paintings.

Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12
Shelley's paintings = 39

Now, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's number of paintings.

Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8
Kim's paintings = 31

So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the increased price:
\[ 40 + (40 \times 0.80) = 40 + 32 = 72 \]
So, the price in December was $72.

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the decreased price:
\[ 72 - (72 \times 0.50) = 72 - 36 = 36 \]
So, the price of the toy after the discount in January was $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the standard lessons. He charges $80 per hour and he has 4 standard lessons.

So, the total from standard lessons is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times \$80/\text{hour} = \$320 \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the veteran lessons. The standard rate is $80, and he reduces this by 25%. So, the reduced rate is:
\[ \$80 - (0.25 \times \$80) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Charlie has 2 veteran lessons, so the total from veteran lessons is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times \$60/\text{hour} = \$120 \]

Now, we add the amounts from the standard and veteran lessons to find the total amount Charlie will make for the day:
\[ \$320 + \$120 = \$440 \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \$440 \]"

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. 

1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos. 

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"First, let's find out how many apples Walter ate. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 apples.

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

So, Walter ate 24 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he ate 24 of them.

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36.

\[ 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \]

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. Now, let's find out how many apples are left after he gave 9 to his sister.

\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple.

\[ 27 \times 3 = 81 \]

So, the final amount of money Walter received is:

"To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we can set up a simple equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:
\[ x = 12 \]

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 24 hours a day, the distance he covers in one day is:

\[ 50 \, \text{km/hr} \times 24 \, \text{hr/day} = 1200 \, \text{km/day} \]

Since he travels for 3 days, the total distance he covers is:

\[ 1200 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3600 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients for one batch of macaroni and cheese:

- The cost of pasta is $1.00.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

Now, let's add up the total cost for one batch:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (52 weeks), the total cost is:

"First, let's calculate the total time needed to clean all 80 classrooms. Since it takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom, for 80 classrooms, the total time required is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert the 8-hour workday into minutes:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the custodian will need to clean all the classrooms:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Since the custodian has 5 days to clean the classrooms, they will be able to finish within the given time. Now, we need to find out what percentage of their 8-hour workday is spent cleaning classrooms. Since they spend the entire 480 minutes of their workday cleaning, the percentage of their day spent cleaning is:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{480 \text{ minutes}} \times 100 = 100\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:

\[ 100\% \]"
"First, let's figure out how many books each shelf can hold:

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- One bookcase has 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf.
- So, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(2 \times 10 + 20 + 15 = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

- \(110 \div 55 = 2\).

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate how much she will earn by selling the eggs.

Rose will sell the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, five dozens will have:
5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs

Now, we need to find out how many sets of 3 eggs are in 60 eggs:
60 eggs / 3 eggs/set = 20 sets

Since she sells each set for $1, her total earnings will be:
20 sets * $1/set = $20.00

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
$20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

So, Rose's profit will be $8.00."
"First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we calculate:

100 hats / 2 = 50 red hats

Now, we need to find out how many hats are left after taking out the red ones:

100 hats - 50 red hats = 50 hats remaining

Out of these remaining hats, 3/5 are blue. So, let's calculate the number of blue hats:

3/5 * 50 hats = 30 blue hats

The rest of the hats are white. To find out how many white hats there are, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats:

50 hats - 30 blue hats = 20 white hats

So, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"First, let's find out the cost of the bag with the discount. The original price is $18.00, and there's a $3.00 discount, so the new price is:

\[ $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 \]

Now, we need to find out the cost per stick of beef jerky. There are 30 sticks in a bag, so we divide the total cost by the number of sticks:

\[ \frac{$15.00}{30 \text{ sticks}} = $0.50 \text{ per stick} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ $0.50 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is given as 116. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes:

"Brianna and her family have 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights (one for each person). There are 8 rooms, so they have 2 flashlights for each room, which means they have 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights for the rooms. Adding the personal flashlights, they have a total of 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

For the candles, half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's also 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles. Adding these together, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using a total of 20 flashlights and 36 candles.

Final numerical answer:

Since there were also half as many helmets as footballs, the number of footballs is:

\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:

\[ \text{Total items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} \]
\[ \text{Total items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"First, let's figure out how many minutes Tim spends at work each day answering phones. Since he spends 6 hours each day at work and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the total minutes as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many calls he can handle in one day. Since it takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work each day by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ 360 \text{ minutes/day} \div 15 \text{ minutes/call} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

Now, to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of days in the work week:

For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water each:
8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

Now, we know Crista has 20 plants in total. So, the remaining plants are:
20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants

These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each:
8 plants * 0.25 cup/plant = 2 cups

Now, we add up all the water needed:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas Frog to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and swim in water, and then add these times together.

The total distance Phineas needs to travel is 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Now, we add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is 15 minutes."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

First, we need to find out how many boxes Bob needs:
56 sticks ÷ 8 sticks/box = 7 boxes

7 boxes × $2.00/box = $14.00

So, the final numerical answer is:
$14.00"
"The main phone plan costs $20, and each additional phone costs half of that, which is $20 / 2 = $10.

There are four additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40.

The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

**Final Answer:**
$60"
"First, let's calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes every day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts daily and one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, he makes:

\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts he makes in June. Assuming June has 30 days, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:

\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total money he makes in June is:

\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Derrick makes in June is:

\[ 7200 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, we need to find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day. Since she uploads 6 batches each day and each batch contains 7 photos, we can calculate the number of photos uploaded per day as follows:

\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day:

\[ 210 \text{ photos} \div 42 \text{ photos/day} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"First, let's calculate the cost for one week:

- For 5 blouses at $5.00 each: \(5 \times 5 = 25\)
- For 2 pants at $8.00 each: \(2 \times 8 = 16\)
- For 1 skirt at $6.00: \(1 \times 6 = 6\)

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost for one week:
\[25 + 16 + 6 = 47\]

Since Alicia has to pay this amount weekly, we need to find out how much she spends in 5 weeks:
\[47 \times 5 = 235\]

So, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is:
\[235\]"
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to determine how long it will take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So for these four days, the total number of people is:
60 * 4 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (rest of the week) = 500 people.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 500."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is three times the initial rate.
   - \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) kernels pop.

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is four times the initial rate.
   - \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) kernels pop.

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate is half of the rate in the previous 30 seconds.
   - \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) kernels pop.

5. **Residual heat:**
   - A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop.
   - \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) additional kernels pop.

Now, let's sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- Residual heat: 10 kernels

Total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, Garrett has \(\boxed{210}\) pieces of popcorn to eat."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs to make. He needs 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, making it 5 gallons in total.

For the 4 gallons of regular lemonade, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup of lemon juice per gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ cup of lemon juice} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

So, the total amount of lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups} \]

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the number of lemons needed for 6 cups of juice is:
\[ 6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 36 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need:
\[ \boxed{36} \] lemons."
"First, let's calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

For the German Shepherds:
3 German Shepherds * 5 kg/day = 15 kg/day

For the Bulldogs:
2 Bulldogs * 3 kg/day = 6 kg/day

Now, let's add the daily consumption of both types of dogs:
15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

To find out how much they need in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals:
10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals:
15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs on the farm:
20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

So, the total number of legs on the farm is 80.

The final numerical answer is:

"The tower has 4 blue blocks. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(4 \times 2 = 8\) yellow blocks. 

Let's denote the number of red blocks as \(R\). The total number of blocks in the tower is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks, which is \(4 + 8 + R = 32\).

So, we have:
\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks."

"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

So, the value of the boat after three years is $3528."
"First, let's figure out how many candies of each color there are.

- Red candies: 54
- Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(54 \times 2 = 108\)
- Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(54 \div 2 = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is:
\[43\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of one night at the hotel. It's given that one night at the hotel costs $80.

Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost of one bus trip. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 80 \times 0.10 = 8 \]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the hotel and the total cost of the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 296 \]"
"First, we need to find out how many marbles Dallas has after dropping 4 of them. Initially, Dallas has 21 marbles. After dropping 4, he has:

\[ 21 - 4 = 17 \]

So, Dallas has 17 marbles now. Since Mazie gave all 52 marbles to Dallas and Darla, and Dallas has 17 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla has by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas has from the total number of marbles Mazie gave away:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 35 marbles. 

The final answer is:

The cost for the adult tickets is 2 adults * $12/adult = $24.
The cost for the child ticket is 1 child * $8/child = $8.
The cost for the popcorns is 2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6.

Adding these together, the total cost is $24 + $8 + $6 = $38.

So, they pay $38 in total."
"First, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add all the weights together:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to push the car. 

\[ 1\% \text{ of } 1600 \text{ pounds} = \frac{1}{100} \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

5 + 2 = 7 hours.

So, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

7 hours"
"First, let's calculate how much feed Dexter's pigs eat in a day.

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed consumption per day for all pigs is:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds per pig per day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total feed consumption for a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, the amount of feed left is:

Next, we need to determine how many more hot dogs John needs to buy. He already has 4 hot dogs left over. So, the number of additional hot dogs needed is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. So, the number of packs needed is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for the hot dogs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's calculate how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40

She sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

So, the total money from selling cupcakes and cookies is:
$40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) = $80

Next, let's calculate how much she spends on the trays:
5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Now, we subtract the amount spent on trays from the total money made:
$80 (total money made) - $20 (spent on trays) = $60

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first street, there are 5 children following the truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children doubles: \(5 \times 2 = 10\).
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, each child is now part of a group of 3 (1 original child + 2 new children): \(10 \times 3 = 30\).
4. The original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract 5 from 30: \(30 - 5 = 25\).

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25."

"First, let's calculate the time Charisma spends on meditation each day. She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which totals 30 minutes per day.

Next, we calculate the total time spent on meditation over 4 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, in 4 weeks there are \(4 \times 7 = 28\) days. So, the total time spent on meditation in 4 weeks is \(28 \times 30\) minutes.

Now, let's calculate the time spent on yoga. She practices 1 hour of yoga, 5 days a week. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, in 4 weeks she practices \(4 \times 5 = 20\) hours of yoga, which is \(20 \times 60 = 1200\) minutes.

Now, we add the total time spent on meditation and yoga:
- Total meditation time: \(28 \times 30 = 840\) minutes
- Total yoga time: 1200 minutes

Adding these together gives us the total time spent on both activities:
\[840 + 1200 = 2040\]

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 2040 minutes."
"To find out the total square footage of the quilt, we need to calculate the square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the square footage from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from small t-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate the square footage from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from medium t-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, let's calculate the square footage from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from large t-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all the square footage:
- Total square footage = square footage from small t-shirts + square footage from medium t-shirts + square footage from large t-shirts
- Total square footage = \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 3 dozen seeds equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) seeds.

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36, we calculate \(36 \times 0.50 = 18\). Therefore, a large sunflower has \(36 + 18 = 54\) seeds.

To find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower together: \(36 + 54 = 90\).

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is 90."
"First, we find out how many pens Timothy has. Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, and George has 18 pens, Timothy has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) pens.

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens."
"First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Albert is 36 inches tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is:

\[ 36 \times 2 = 72 \text{ inches tall} \]

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, Jackie's current height is:

\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, her height before the summer was:

\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."
"The company produces 5000 bars of chocolate per day and sells each bar for $2. 

First, we calculate the daily revenue:
5000 bars/day * $2/bar = $10,000/day

Next, we calculate the revenue for two weeks (14 days):
$10,000/day * 14 days = $140,000

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8.

For the first T-shirt, the cost is $8.
For the second T-shirt, the cost is 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40. So, the discount on the shoes is 40% of $40, which is $40 * 0.4 = $16. Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends:
$12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"First, let's calculate how much money Ryan has after 3 weeks of doing chores. Ryan gets $6 each week, so for 3 weeks, he gets:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so for 4 ice cream cones, he spends:

\[ 1.25 \times 4 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream from his total allowance to find out how much money he has left:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Ryan and his 3 friends want to go to the movies, and each movie ticket costs $6.50. Since there are 4 of them, the total cost for the movie tickets is:

\[ 6.50 \times 4 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

However, Ryan only has $13 left, which is not enough to buy 4 movie tickets. Therefore, the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in all, we need to add up the cost of all the items they bought.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.
So, the cost of the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]
Adding the cost of the sunglasses, Lani's total is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add Ellen's total and Lani's total to find out how much they spent in all:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount they spent is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar of the mixture:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, the selling price of one jar is $50. So, the profit from one jar is:

Profit per jar = Selling price - Cost = $50 - $44 = $6

If Tim sells 10 jars, the total profit is:

Total profit = Profit per jar * Number of jars = $6 * 10 = $60

Final numerical answer:
$60"
"First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- Quarters: 32 quarters × $0.25 = $8.00
- Dimes: 95 dimes × $0.10 = $9.50
- Nickels: 120 nickels × $0.05 = $6.00
- Pennies: 750 pennies × $0.01 = $7.50

Now, let's add up the total value:

$8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00

The total dollar amount in the jar is $31.00."
"First, let's add up all the money Janet spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets (2 tickets at $7.50 each): $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, subtract the total amount spent from the $40 her parents gave her:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"First, let's figure out how many days Josh is open in a week. Since he is closed on Sunday and Wednesday, he is open for 5 days a week.

Next, we calculate how many cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day and is open 5 days a week, he services \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cars in a week.

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in a week. Since he gets paid $4 per car, in a week he makes \(15 \times 4 = 60\) dollars.

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2. So, \(60 \times 2 = 120\) dollars.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
120
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = 8
   - Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = 3
   - Sugar: 5 - 1 = 4

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = 6

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar: 4 - 2 = 2

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = 10
   - Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = 7
   - Sugar: 2 + 4 = 6

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal: 10
- Chocolate chip: 7
- Sugar: 6

Total cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Final numerical answer:
23"
"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. If he sells half of them at $5 each and the other half at $7 each, we can calculate the total money he would earn as follows:

Half of 12 is 6. So, he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and the other 6 at $7 each.

For the first 6 toy soldiers at $5 each:
6 * $5 = $30

For the other 6 toy soldiers at $7 each:
6 * $7 = $42

Adding these amounts together:
$30 + $42 = $72

So, Matthew would earn $72."
"First, let's calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. So, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes net reduction/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill in all 84 holes at a net reduction rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. 

Final answer:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]"
"First, we need to find out the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment of Butler High School from that of Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested:
   - 16 test tubes
   - 7 beakers
   - 14 Petri dishes

2. Igor gathered:
   - Half as many test tubes as requested: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes
   - Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes
   - The correct number of beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers he actually brought as \( x \)

3. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

6. Since Igor was supposed to bring 7 beakers but only brought 5, the number of beakers he lost is:
   \[
   7 - 5 = 2
   \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"First, let's calculate the total number of screws needed for the tables.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, the number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws per table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so it has 10 * 2 = 20 eggs. 

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket: 10 + 20 = 30.

**Final Answer: 30**"
"First, let's find out how much each person raised.

Alexandra raised $430.
Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raised $300.
Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:

Alexandra: $430
Kim: $750
Maryam: $700
Sarah: $300

Total = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

They all raised a total of $2180."
"First, let's figure out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, and Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran half of that, which is 2 miles.

Next, we need to determine Aaron's speed. Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes. So, his speed is 2 miles in 16 minutes.

Now, we know Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Aaron takes 16 minutes for 2 miles, it would take him 8 minutes for 1 mile (since 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile).

Since Vanessa runs each mile twice as slow as Aaron, it would take her 16 minutes for 1 mile (since 8 minutes per mile * 2 = 16 minutes per mile).

Vanessa ran 4 miles, so the total time she took is 4 miles * 16 minutes per mile = 64 minutes.

So, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. There are 200 feet of dock, so he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line in total.

He already has 6 feet of new line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

"First, let's calculate the cost of the meals and wine for one night:

- They order 2 meals at $5 each, so the cost of the meals is \(2 \times 5 = $10\).
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.

So, the total cost for one night is \(10 + 5 = $15\).

Since they get 6 reservations a night, the total cost for one night, considering all reservations, is \(6 \times 15 = $90\).

If they are open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is \(90 \times 2 = $180\).

So, the final numerical answer is:
180"
"First, let's find out the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

Final answer:
\[ 2.00 \]"
"First, let's figure out the current ages of the individuals mentioned.

Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- So, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400 and he gets it at 80% off.

80% of $400 is calculated as:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's work. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's work to find the total amount Mark paid:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of chickens is \( C \) and the number of cows is \( K \).
2. We know that chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs.
3. We are given two pieces of information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( C + K = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

4. We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2: \( C + 2K = 35 \)

5. Now we have a system of two equations:
   - \( C + K = 20 \)
   - \( C + 2K = 35 \)

6. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
   - \( (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( K = 15 \)

7. Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( C \):
   - \( C + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( C = 5 \)

So, the number of chickens is 5.

Final answer:
