"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs that she sells at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as follows:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

First, we know that each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that in the morning and afternoon, Wendi gives 15 cups and 25 cups of feed, respectively. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Let's break it down:

- For the first glass, the cost is $5.
- For the second glass, the cost is $3 (60% of $5).
- For the third glass, the cost is $5.
- For the fourth glass, the cost is $3.
- And so on...

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can see that the pattern will repeat 8 times (16 glasses / 2 glasses per cycle = 8 cycles).

In each cycle, the total cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Therefore, for 8 cycles, the total cost will be 8 cycles * $8 per cycle = $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
2. Add the time for the Windows update installation.
3. Calculate the time to download the remaining 60% of the file.
4. Sum up all the times to get the total download time.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Time to download 40% of the file:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \(80 \div 2 = 40\) minutes.

2. **Time for the Windows update installation:**
   - This is given as 20 minutes.

3. **Time to download the remaining 60% of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB is \(0.60 \times 200 = 120\) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \(120 \div 2 = 60\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update + Time to download 60%
   - Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance John has traveled and then determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Finally, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. The total time for the return trip is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2.5 hours (2 hours in standstill traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph).
     - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Distance traveled in the first leg = 180 miles.
   - Distance traveled in the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.
   - Total distance traveled = 180 miles (away from home) + 135 miles (return trip) = 315 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Since John is traveling back home, the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is the distance he has traveled away from home minus the distance he has traveled back.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles (away from home) - 135 miles (back towards home) = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. For the first 40 hours, she earns at this rate. For the additional 5 hours (overtime), she earns 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

Regular earnings for 40 hours:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Overtime earnings for 5 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times (1.2 \times \$10/\text{hour}) = 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30%, so the downloads were 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}\)

Now, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:

\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer: 12 years**"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

5. To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

6. Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

7. Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

8. Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final numerical answer is:
18"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 20

2. **Students enrolled in contemporary dance**: 20% of 20
   \[
   0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.

3. **Remaining students after contemporary dance**: 
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]

4. **Students enrolled in jazz dance**: 25% of the remaining 16 students
   \[
   0.25 \times 16 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.

5. **Remaining students after jazz dance**: 
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12
   \]

6. **Students enrolled in hip-hop dance**: The rest of the students, which is 12.

7. **Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance**: 
   \[
   \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

So, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is **60%**."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 + ($5,000 * 2.5%) = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 + ($8,000 * 1.2%) = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, we need to find the profit for each option. Profit is calculated as the final value minus the initial value.

1. **Profit from jewelry:**
   - Profit = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Profit from electronic gadgets:**
   - Profit = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits, the merchant would make more profit by purchasing the jewelry, as the profit from jewelry is $125, which is higher than the $96 profit from electronic gadgets.

**Final profit:**
$125"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

If she makes a 3 egg omelet every day, then in 28 days, she will have eaten 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to cover the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent on the first 6 miles.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to cover the remaining 6 miles.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

Step 1: Total time required to cover 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Time already spent on the first 6 miles:
\[ \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Remaining time to cover the remaining 6 miles:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Step 4: Required speed for the remaining 6 miles:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in the orange drink and the pineapple drink before and after the spill, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \) liters ≈ 6.67 liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water spilled:**
   - 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) liter of water.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \) liters = \( \frac{18}{3} \) liters = 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = 9 liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:**

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the other items she bought.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. So, he stopped at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles.

The distance between his first and second stops is the difference between the mileages of these two stops:
\[45 - 20 = 25\]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars."
"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these numbers together and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours per dog each day. With 10 dogs, he spends:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total time spent per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Aaron has 5 more than this amount:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Aaron has 25 jewels.
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from Aaron's jewels:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Final numerical answer:

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He uses this money to buy 8 video games for $20 each, which costs:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, so the total amount he spent on video games and the remaining money is:

$160 + $5 = $165

Since he started with $195 and ended up with $165 after buying the video games, he should have no lego sets left because he used all the money from selling the lego sets to buy the video games and still had some money left. However, the question asks how many lego sets he still has, and based on the information provided, he should have 0 lego sets left.

0 lego sets"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. So, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 \text{ miles per hour} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, we can determine her walking speed as follows:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4} = \frac{6 \text{ miles per hour}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a period of 6 hours. Therefore, the time spent running and walking is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she can travel while running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content of the entire bag of chips:**
   - A serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the bag are \( 250 \times 5 = 1250 \) calories.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \) calories.

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since the entire 300g bag has 1250 calories, we can find out how many grams correspond to 200 calories by setting up a proportion.
   - The proportion is \( \frac{300 \text{g}}{1250 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x \text{g}}{200 \text{ calories}} \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{300 \times 200}{1250} = \frac{60000}{1250} = 48 \) grams.

So, you can eat 48 grams of chips with your remaining daily calorie target."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \$20.00 \]"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to first determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the average time it takes to write one article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote 5 articles.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
   - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Total articles = \( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \) articles.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
- Total hours = \( 26 \times 4 = 104 \) hours.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of Post-it notes Candice had: 80.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes she used at work: 220.
3. Subtract the number of Post-it notes remaining: 23.

The equation to find the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \text{Initial Post-it notes} - \text{Post-it notes used at work} - \text{Remaining Post-it notes} = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ 80 - 220 - 23 = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

\[ -163 = \text{Post-it notes in the package} \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates an error in the interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the number of Post-it notes used at work and the remaining ones should be subtracted from the initial amount plus the package amount. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \). The equation should be:

\[ 80 + x - 220 - 23 = 0 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 243 = 0 \]
\[ x - 163 = 0 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we need to convert the length of the wire into inches and then divide by the length of each piece.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To calculate how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.

Step 1: Determine how many dozens of eggs are produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week to get the weekly earnings.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact time it takes for Tom to travel back.

If we assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles, then:

1. The time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, and the speed is 10 miles per hour. So, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. On the return trip, the speed is 6 miles per hour. The time taken to travel back can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that weight is from the comic books, then the remaining weight to be removed by the toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

\(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and then sum them up.

1. For the first half of the year (6 months), the charge is $140 per month.
2. For the second half of the year (6 months), the charge is 10% less than $140 per month.

First, let's calculate the charge for the second half of the year:
- 10% of $140 is \(0.10 \times 140 = 14\).
- So, the charge for the second half of the year is \(140 - 14 = 126\) per month.

Now, let's calculate the total for each half of the year:
- For the first 6 months: \(6 \times 140 = 840\).
- For the second 6 months: \(6 \times 126 = 756\).

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total for the year:
- Total amount paid = \(840 + 756 = 1596\).

The total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel with a full tank.

First, we calculate the car's fuel efficiency:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas.
- Therefore, the car's fuel efficiency is \( \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \).

Next, we use the fuel efficiency to find out how far she can drive on a full tank:
- The tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
- At 25 miles per gallon, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is \( 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \).

"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching those students.

First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has \(20 \times 2 = 40\) instructions.

"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of each item sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 slices
- Each slice is sold for $3

For cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices
- Each slice is sold for $4

Now, let's calculate:

For brownies: \(43 \times 3 = 129\) dollars
For cheesecakes: \(23 \times 4 = 92\) dollars

Adding these together gives us the total amount raised:

\(129 + 92 = 221\) dollars

Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment.
3. Calculate the total amount to be paid.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
Total cost before interest = 5 * $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment.
The interest rate is 2% per month.
Total interest = $750 * 2% * 3 = $750 * 0.02 * 3 = $45

Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost before interest + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $45 = $795

Step 4: Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3
Monthly payment = $795 / 3 = $265

Therefore, Shiela will pay $265 each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we can find the total square footage of the sandcastle by summing the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, the first year will have 365 days. 

To find out how many cups of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year, we subtract the 180 days from the total days in a year:

365 days - 180 days = 185 days

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:

180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 - 180 = 5 days, the puppy will consume:

5 days * 1 cup/day = 5 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume:

180 cups + 5 cups = 185 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups per bag:

185 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.6818181818181818 bags

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to buy 2 bags of dog food to have enough for the first year.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
2. Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
2. Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we compare the two costs to find the savings:

1. Cost with packages of 3: $15.00
2. Cost with packages of 2: $9.00
3. Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{6.00}

"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so together they got:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 + \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = \frac{24}{6} + \frac{24}{6} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Then a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Adding these up, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\).

"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for those who've stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the increased salary from the next year, which is her 6th year of service.

Let's calculate her salary after each year for the next three years:

1. After the first year (6th year of service):
   - New salary = Initial salary + 10% of initial salary
   - New salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New salary = $600 + $60
   - New salary = $660

2. After the second year (7th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New salary = $660 + $66
   - New salary = $726

3. After the third year (8th year of service):
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New salary = $798.60

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad that the adults will eat.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children, so the total amount of potato salad for the children is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad that the adults will eat.
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults, so the total amount of potato salad for the adults is \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) pounds.

Step 3: Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.
- The total amount of potato salad needed is \( 25 + 200 = 225 \) pounds.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Let's denote the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time before the diet change was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee's current time is 38 seconds. This means that \( G - 2 = 38 \). Solving for \( G \), we get:
\[ G = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change. This means his new time is 90% of his original time. So, we calculate Gerald's new time as follows:
\[ \text{New time} = G \times 0.90 = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 × 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 \) (the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes plus the cars that drove through in the second 15 minutes).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then its volume. The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. This means that the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of one box will be:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we can calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7 hours, the hours watched on Wednesday can be calculated as:

- 7 hours (total) - 5 hours (Monday to Friday) = 2 hours

These 2 hours on Wednesday were made up of a few 30-minute episodes. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can calculate the number of 30-minute episodes as:

- 2 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 4 episodes

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
4"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
50"
"To calculate the final cost after the cashback reward, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to get the final amount.

Let's do the math:

1. Total cost of 10 gallons of gas = 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00
2. Total cashback for 10 gallons = 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00
3. Final amount after cashback = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The final amount for 10 gallons of gas after the cashback reward is $28.00."
"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to get the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
45"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows to the shore. We know that it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this journey. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. We can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."
"To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- Each lesson uses the whiteboard.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

First, we calculate the total number of lessons in a day by multiplying the number of teachers by the number of lessons each teacher has:

4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons/day

Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:

8 lessons/day * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings/day

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day for 15 days, so the total number of flowers planted is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

1. Cost of the 2x4x10 boards:
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

2. Cost of the 4x4x10 boards:
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

Total cost of all the lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. Revenue from selling the 2x4x10 boards:
   - She sells 10 boards.
   - Assuming she sells them at the same price she bought them for, the revenue = 10 * $10 = $100.

2. Revenue from selling the 4x4x10 boards:
   - She sells 5 boards.
   - Assuming she sells them at the same price she bought them for, the revenue = 5 * $16 = $80.

Total revenue from selling all the lumber = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

42 teaspoons"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

Therefore, John paid \(\$360\)."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day is:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles - 10 vehicles = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[ 40,000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000 \]

3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[ 40,000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30 \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \]

4. Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, her new salary is:
   \[ 30,769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30,769.23 \times 1.40 = 43,076.94 \]

5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[ 56,000 + 43,076.94 = 99,076.94 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.94."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

To find out how many sheets he uses in a week, we multiply the number of pads by the number of sheets per pad:
2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of sheets he uses in a month by multiplying the weekly usage by 4:
60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, which is:
2 * 5 = 10 apples

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette, which is:
8 / 2 = 4 oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits they have:

Morisette's fruits: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
Kael's fruits: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Total fruits: 13 + 14 = 27 fruits

They have a total of 27 fruits."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so she slept:
8 - 2 = 6 hours each of those days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those 6 hours, so she slept:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each of those days.

Assuming the rest of the week includes Tuesday, Wednesday, and the days after, we have 5 days in total for the rest of the week (Monday + 3 days + 1 day).

So, the total sleep for the rest of the week is:
7 hours/day * 3 days = 21 hours.

Adding the sleep from Monday and the rest of the week:
8 hours (Monday) + 6 hours (Tuesday) + 6 hours (Wednesday) + 7 hours (Thursday) + 7 hours (Friday) = 34 hours.

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 34 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, which means she covers:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After the initial 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since the total time is 7 hours, the remaining time is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

At 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, she covers:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the two distances together, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours."
"Jennie put stamps on one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. So, she stamped:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

letters. These 20 letters are now in the pile of already-stamped letters. We know that after she added these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, the number of letters that were already in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Given that each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of the other items based on this information.

1. The cost of a watermelon is three times the cost of a pepper:
   \[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

2. The cost of an orange is 5 dollars less than the cost of a watermelon:
   \[ \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the items Dillon is buying:

- 4 watermelons at $45 each:
  \[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

- 20 peppers at $15 each:
  \[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

- 10 oranges at $40 each:

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit, so we subtract 20 from the initial 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

The percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many babies as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
- \( B = 2Q \)
- \( W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \)

Now, we substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- \( B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \)
- \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"To determine the total cost, we first need to identify which items are non-food items and then calculate the tax on those items.

- Milk is a food item, so it costs $2.
- Eggs are a food item, so they cost $3.
- Light bulbs are non-food items, so they cost $3.
- Cups are non-food items, so they cost $3.
- Roach traps are non-food items, so they cost $4.

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the non-food items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items to the total cost of the non-food items including tax:
\[ 2 + 3 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, which means he will have a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. Therefore, for 8 clients, he will need:
- 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach/client = 16 bottles of bleach
- 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths/client = 8 packs of cloths

The cost for the supplies will be:
- 16 bottles of bleach * $2/bottle = $32
- 8 packs of cloths * $5/pack = $40

So, the total expenses for the supplies will be $32 + $40 = $72.

"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months, so in a year (12 months), he can harvest:
  12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests per year.

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples per hectare per year = 100 pineapples/hectare * 4 harvests/year
- Total pineapples for 10 hectares = 100 * 4 * 10 = 4000 pineapples.

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as the first 6 hours leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive.

From the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave, and 15 bees return in the next 6 hours. So, 30 - 15 = 15 bees did not return in the first 12 hours.

In the last 6 hours, these 15 bees return to the hive, along with the 60 bees that left in the third 6-hour period. So, the total number of bees returning in the last 6 hours is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Final numerical answer:
75"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"To solve this problem, we can start by setting up some equations based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so Charlie has \( 3D \) friends.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4D \) friends.
- Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, so we can write the equation \( 3D = 12 \).

Now, we can solve for \( D \):
\[ 3D = 12 \]
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has:
\[ 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:
16"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet, since the speeds are given in feet per minute. There are 5280 feet in a mile.

For Steve:
- Distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Speed: 440 feet per minute

Time for Steve to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Steve}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Steve}}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
- Distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
- Speed: 264 feet per minute

Time for Tim to get home:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Tim}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Tim}}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in their times:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we need to determine the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

- Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles mean \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles mean \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle means \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 0.25 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"To find out how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid to find the change.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies.
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Each cookie costs $0.10.
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the change.
Carl pays with a $10 bill.
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries were in the pack initially.

1. Let the initial number of fries be \( x \).

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so the remaining fries are \( x - 14 \).

3. The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).

4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. The remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).

5. A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the remaining fries are \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \), which is \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \).

6. Ants carried off the final fry, leaving 5 behind. So, the remaining fries before the ants took the last one were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x - 30}{3} = 6 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 3:
\[ x - 30 = 18 \]

Then, we add 30 to both sides:
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the initial number of fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

Final numerical answer:
48"
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}\)

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \(2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

Adding these together, the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes in one week is:
\(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}\)

Now, we multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in the semester (16 weeks):
\(17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}\)

So, in one semester, Kimo spends a total of 272 hours attending classes."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

First, let's convert the lengths to a consistent unit. Since the final answer needs to be in feet, we'll convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot.

- Each roll is 4 inches long, which is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now, let's calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- Total length of rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Total length of croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Total length of baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

Adding these lengths together gives us the total length of all the baked goods:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Total bananas needed per month = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas

For 2 months, the total bananas needed = 700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs and then find the difference between the two distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- The football field is 100 yards long.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip is \(100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards}\).
- Therefore, Blake runs a total of \(200 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
- The distance to the 40-yard line and back is \(40 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 80 \text{ yards}\).
- Therefore, Kelly runs a total of \(80 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards}\).

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.
- The difference is \(3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards}\).

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."

"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Combined total: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

They were able to catch a total of 32 fish."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

36 / 2 = 18

So, the price will increase 18 times.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. We can represent the new price after each increase as:

New Price = Original Price * (1 + Increase Rate)

Where the increase rate is 20%, or 0.20. So, the new price after each increase is:

New Price = $20 * (1 + 0.20) = $20 * 1.20

Now, we need to apply this increase 18 times. Since the price increases by the same factor each time, we can represent the final price after 18 increases as:

Final Price = Original Price * (1.20)^18

Let's calculate this:

Final Price = $20 * (1.20)^18

Using a calculator to find (1.20)^18:

(1.20)^18 ≈ 10.011523

Now, we multiply this by the original price:

Final Price = $20 * 10.011523 ≈ $200.23

So, the final numerical answer is:

$200.23"
"Given:

The cost of one red car is $4.
The cost of one action figure is $5.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The total cost of the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]
- The total cost of the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]
- The cost of the doll is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost of all the toys is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. The accountant charges $90.
2. If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35 per hour.

First, calculate the lost income:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income:
\[ \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have \$15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the scanner is €157.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:

\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. To find out how much money she will have left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

\[ 1500 - 1423 = 77 \]

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she will need for 15 Spanish flans.

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old."
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then twice the money Ethel has is 2 * $8 = $16. Adding $2 to that amount gives us $16 + $2 = $18.

"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day, which is 2 days.

So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:
20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles

And the total miles he walks on the weekend is:
10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles

Adding these together gives the total miles he walks in a week:
100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so the jacket costs:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of each uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Each uniform costs a total of $150."

"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red is:
2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two is:
16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we can find the total age of the four birds by adding their ages together:
Sally Two (19 years) + Granny Red (16 years) + Sally Four (8 years) + Sally Thirtytwo (8 years) = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years.

The total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the increased monthly payment for each debt.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300/month
   - 50% more: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Next, we add up the increased monthly payments for all debts:

- Total increased monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we multiply the total increased monthly payment by 12:

Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the peeling time is \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the cutting time is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time to minutes:
- \(300\) seconds is \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

Now, we add the peeling time and the cutting time to get the total prep time:
- Total time = peeling time + cutting time
- Total time = \(90\) minutes + \(5\) minutes
- Total time = \(95\) minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

1. Zaid's salary is $6000 per month.

2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total amount spent on rent and car fuel is:

\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is:

\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years old.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner takes 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
The difference in time = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then expressing that difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[ 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \]

To express this difference as a percentage of the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{0.25}{0.25} \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\)
- For the rabbits: \(20 \text{ pieces}\)

So, the total straw used for hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

Since the total straw distributed among the small rodents is 160 pieces, the straw used for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages with equal numbers of rats. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(x\). Therefore, the total number of rats is \(3x\), and the total straw used for the rats is \(6 \times 3x = 18x\).

We know that \(18x = 90\), so we can solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{90}{18} = 5\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost price per bag for the trader is the purchase price plus the transportation cost, which is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars per bag.

The selling price per bag is \( 30 \) dollars.

The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars per bag.

The total profit is given as \( 400 \) dollars. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as the profit per bag multiplied by the number of bags, which gives us the equation:

\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \( 50 \) bags.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ 34 \]

Each of them paid $34."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks in the flock.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is **91**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Friday Morning:** Sue's front yard has 18 pink plastic flamingos.
2. **Saturday Morning:** The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. They then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \), and the number of white flamingos is 6.
3. **Sunday Morning:** The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \), and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos is 30 and the number of white flamingos is 6. The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200
Total cards = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices.

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - He used 1 more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the four highest scores (89, 92, 100, 86) is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score \( x \), the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) is:
\[ 367 + x \]

To achieve an average of 93 over the five tests, the equation is:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 367 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93."

Therefore, the total distance Micheal did is 860 kilometers."
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, half a dozen plates (which is 6 plates) would cost:
   \[ 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

2. The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
   \[ 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \]

3. Twenty dozen cups is equal to \(24 \times 20 = 480\) cups. To find the cost of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
   \[ \frac{34800}{480} = 72.5 \]

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $72.5.

\[
\text{The cost of each cup is } \$72.5.

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy and then figure out how much more money she needs to earn.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is $20 * 2 = $40.
   - The total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

2. Calculate how much money Sara has already earned and saved:
   - Sara has $10 saved before she starts babysitting.
   - She babysits 4 times, earning $5 each time, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
   - Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, and we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to reach the total amount needed.

3. Calculate the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn:
   - Sara's total savings and earnings from babysitting is $10 + $20 = $30.

4. Determine how much more money Sara needs to afford the items:
   - The total cost of the items is $70, and Sara has $30, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

5. Calculate how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:
   - Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times.

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance he walks by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
(24 + 45 + 66) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

The average age of the three in three years will be 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, we calculate the points scored by Brianna:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. So, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. So, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left and the rainwater collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. 

To find the number of petunias, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:
90 - 40 = 50 petunias.

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
90 + 50 = 140.

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of that amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

"The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 

The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by car takes half as many days as by bus, which is 6 / 2 = 3 days.

If Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and returns by car, the total travel time will be:

6 days (bus to Rochester) + 3 days (car from Rochester) = 9 days.

Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days."
"First, let's calculate the new number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's find the total number of cards:

30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 total cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = 33.3333... \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:

\[ 33\% \]"
"To calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito, we need to add up the cost of each item he added to the base burrito and then subtract the value of the gift card.

1. Base burrito: $6.50
2. Extra meat: $2.00
3. Extra cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom's rate is half of Kalinda's rate, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

1 hour"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for each car.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects:

The total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. When he uses these pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens left from the process of making the new pens.
5. Now, he has 5 new full pens and 5 empty pens, making a total of 10 pens.
6. He can again mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has.
7. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
8. Now, he has 6 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 7 pens.
9. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left from the previous step).
10. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
11. Now, he has 7 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 8 pens.
12. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left from the previous step).
13. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
14. Now, he has 8 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 9 pens.
15. He can mix the ink from 5 of these pens to make 1 more full pen. So, he can make 1 more pen from the 5 empty pens he has (including the 1 empty pen he had left from the previous step).
16. After making this pen, he will have 1 empty pen left from the process of making the new pen.
17. Now, he has 9 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 10 pens.

At this point, he does not have enough empty pens to make another full pen. Therefore, the total number of pens he can have is 10.

"To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.

Let's start with step 1:

1. 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, the number of students who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. The number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700

3. 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, the number of students who went out through exit B is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B. So, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.

Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 \times 5 = 30\) pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Given that Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, the total time he spends writing a week is \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day to do the makeup.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \( 250 \times 6 = 1500 \) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \( 1500 \times 4 = 6000 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \( 6000 \times 5 = 30000 \) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \( 30000 \times 0.10 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \( 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of **$27,000**."

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister."

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the new cows to the original number of cows in each stall:

\[ 20 \text{ original cows/stall} + 2 \text{ new cows/stall} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

\[ 22 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 176 \]"
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill, and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: 100 pennies are worth \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollar.
2. **Nickels**: 40 nickels are worth \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollars.
3. **Dimes**: 20 dimes are worth \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollars.
4. **Dollar bills**: 40 dollar bills are worth \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values:

\[1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00\]

So, Brady has a total of \(45.00\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:
8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds.

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten 30% of it is 5600 pounds."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:

- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

"To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making.
2. Determine how many cups of flour are needed for the total number of cookies.

First, let's find the total number of cookies:
- Today, Carla is making 36 cookies.
- Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies.
- Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour are required for 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies. So, we can set up a proportion to find out how many cups are needed for 66 cookies.

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so Ferdinand has \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so Harry has \( 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \) trees.

Now, to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\( 11 - 3 = 8 \)

So, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard."
"Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175.

To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their amounts together:

"To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. Calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times \$350,000 = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

2. Calculate the transfer fee:
\[ \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \times \$350,000 = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

3. Calculate the total price of the house:
\[ \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} \]
\[ \text{Total price} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

4. Calculate how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total price} - \text{Budget} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget."
"To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to subtract the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000
   Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat it to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the time to heat the oil to 300 degrees, the time to heat it to 400 degrees, and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent on all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:

- The number of newspaper ads bought is 50.

So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- The cost per television ad is $75.
- The number of television ads bought is 15.

So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."
"The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, so there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls.

300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, we calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- So, the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
- \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, we calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- There are 4 additional windows in each house.
- So, the total number of additional windows for both houses is:
- \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Finally, we add the number of windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

The cashier gives back $5.00."
"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, so the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:

- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Lyrics to the solo song**: 54 lines.

2. **First scene**:
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second scene**:
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize: \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's start with step 1:

- Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

Next, step 2:

- The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
- The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
- Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

Finally, step 3:

- Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
- The number of sterling silver beads is the length occupied by the beads divided by the length of each bead, which is \(17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars used in the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's:
3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars

There are two rows of 6 stars, so that's:
2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:
40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars

There are 8 children, so we divide the remaining bars equally among them:

16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars/child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is 2.5 hours.

First, convert the working time into minutes:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval, her total earnings are:
15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"After 3 rounds, the points for each player are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So, Mike and Tony, who both have over 20 points, get an extra point each. Jim does not get an extra point because he has 18 points, which is not over 20.

After the extra points are distributed:
- Mike's total points become 21 + 1 = 22.
- Jim's total points remain 18.
- Tony's total points become 42 + 1 = 43.

The total points for all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83.

Final numerical answer:
83"
"The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son will wash 8 oranges (since he is 8 years old), and the youngest son will wash 4 oranges (since he is 4 years old).

Together, they will wash \(8 + 4 = 12\) oranges.

Will bought 15 oranges, so the number of oranges left unwashed is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

3"
"On the first day, Darren does:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities he's done in the two days is:
220 + 90 + 60 = 370

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Let's go through each step:

1. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Since there are 5 members and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total consumption per meal is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]
   Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
   \[
   1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. Now, to find out how much rice is consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
   \[
   \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

Let's calculate the bids:

- First bid (after the opening bid): $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add up all the bids Carmen makes:

$250 (first bid) + $300 (second bid) + $350 (third bid) = $900

So, the desk costs Carmen $900."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonus.

1. **Mileage Calculation:**
   - Distance to work: 30 miles
   - Round trip: 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles
   - Days per week: 5
   - Weeks per year: 50
   - Total miles per year: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles

2. **Mileage Charge:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total mileage cost: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000

3. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Months per year: 12
   - Total bonus cost: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost: $30,000 (mileage) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800

Therefore, John pays a total of $31,800 a year for the driving service."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's the reasoning:

- Each sheet of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.
- For a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 pages in total.
- Since each sheet of paper can print 4 pages, you would need 32 / 4 = 8 sheets of paper to print all 32 pages.

However, the question asks for the number of pieces of paper used, not the number of sheets. In the context of printing, each sheet of paper is used to print two pages (one on the front and one on the back). Therefore, to get 32 pages, you would need 16 pieces of paper (since 16 pieces of paper would give you 32 pages when folded and printed)."
"Annika started with $50.

She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

She also spent an additional $10 on rides.

So, the total amount spent is:
\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount left is:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount left is $15."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:
\[90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works a total of 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

50 hours * $10/hour = $500

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

$500 (hourly wage) + $300 (bonus) = $800

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

$800/week * 4 weeks = $3200

Therefore, Watson made $3200 in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people.

Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, we calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning, so:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves} \]

This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves} \]

Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds (since 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds).

The final numerical answer is:

8 pounds"
"To calculate the savings, let's first determine the discount for each item and then apply it to the quantities you're buying.

1. **Discount on ice cream:**
   - Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
   - Sale price of one tub of ice cream: $11
   - Discount per tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

2. **Discount on milk:**
   - Discount per packet of milk: $0.5

Now, let's calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

3. **Total savings on ice cream:**
   - Savings per tub: $2
   - Total savings for 2 tubs: $2 * 2 = $4

4. **Total savings on milk:**
   - Savings per packet: $0.5
   - Total savings for 4 packets: $0.5 * 4 = $2

5. **Total savings:**
   - Total savings on ice cream: $4

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - The person grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - The person grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the business suits and suitcases:

- Business suits: 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
- Suitcases: 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150

Next, we calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit:

- Cost of a business suit = $100
- 5 times the cost of a business suit = 5 * $100 = $500
- Flight ticket cost = $500 + $700 = $1200

Now, let's add up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:

- Total cost = $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight ticket) = $2950

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so we need to subtract this from his total budget of $6000 to find out how much he has left for other expenses:

- Remaining budget = $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Now, we subtract the total cost of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the remaining budget to find out how much he can spend on gifts:

- Amount for gifts = $4000 - $2950 = $1050

Therefore, Theo has to spend $1050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. In the family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
2. The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

First, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, add the two amounts to get the total daily egg consumption:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since they eat eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

The family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

30 - 3 = 27 years old.

Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, Trent's age is:

27 + 5 = 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:
120000"
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

It also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number (8) had previous commitments:

- \(1/4 \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Now, we subtract the people who couldn't come and those who had previous commitments from the total number of people invited:

- Total people who couldn't come: \(8 + 2 = 10\)

So, the number of people who show up is:

- \(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"First, let's calculate the number of marbles Solomon received from his father. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna, and his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store. He initially had 50 marbles, bought 20 more from Johanna, and received 8 more from his father. So, the total number of marbles is:

\[
50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can use the information provided to find the number of girls and nongendered children.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of poles:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of poles}}{\text{Number of wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \( P \) be the number of poles. Then:

\[
\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solving for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 people left, which is 10 people.

22 men stayed at the party, which means that 25 - 22 = 3 men left.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must be women.

Before any left, there were 15 women. If 7 women left, then 15 - 7 = 8 women stayed at the party.

Final numerical answer:
8 women are left at the party."
"The book costs $4.

The pen costs $1."
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we first need to determine the total number of pencils they have together.

Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which gives a total of 26 pencils. We can set up the equation for Jam's pencils as follows:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} + 2 = 26 \]

Let's solve for the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3 \times \text{number of pencils per box} = 24 \]
\[ \text{number of pencils per box} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which totals 26 pencils. Meg has 46 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils they have together is:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils if each box can hold 8 pencils. We can calculate this by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Now, we need to account for the 15 milliliters of cream added. The cream also weakens the coffee, so we add this to the weakening from the ice cubes:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, and we know there are 40 junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total monthly payment to junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly payment to senior programmers} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total monthly payment to senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Final numerical answer:
224000"
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people on the bus then became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\).
3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). So, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. Given that the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes per percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops, so she then has:

7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.

If Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella, she will have:

17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

Final numerical answer:
14"
"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, and for every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. 

So, the rewards earned = $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.

Each reward is worth $1, so the total reward value is $4.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43 and used their rewards. The coupon takes twice the amount of the rewards off the price. 

The amount taken off by the coupon = 2 * $4 = $8.

So, the total amount after applying the rewards and the coupon = $43 - $4 (rewards) - $8 (coupon) = $43 - $12 = $31.

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job has a higher net pay rate and by how much, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual pay before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax rate: 20%
- Tax amount: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate: 10%
- Tax amount: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A)."
"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ruined castles.
40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40% of 220:
\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.
Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Final numerical answer:
44"
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then subtract one from the other.

For Furniture United:

- Total cost: $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

For Cozy Homes:
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installments: 9 * $250 = $2,250
- Total cost: $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Now, we find the difference between the two total costs:
- Cost difference: $3,450 - $3,350 = $100

The cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they shared them equally, we first need to calculate the total number of guns they have combined.

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, Richard (assuming this is the same as RJ) has 1 gun, and Richard (the other one) has 5 guns. So, the total number of guns is:

8 (DJ) + 10 (Nick) + 1 (RJ) + 5 (Richard) = 24 guns

Now, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4:

24 guns ÷ 4 people = 6 guns per person

Each of them would have 6 guns if they shared them equally."
"To calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
2. Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.
3. Add the two amounts together.

For 8 batches of suckers:
30 ounces/batch × 8 batches = 240 ounces

For 1 batch of fudge:
70 ounces/batch × 1 batch = 70 ounces

240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge."
"Maria initially buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the initial value of her investment is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%. The new price per share is:

\[ \$8 \times (1 + 0.50) = \$8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \]

So, the value of her 8 shares after the first year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. The new price per share is:

\[ \$12 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$12 \times 0.75 = \$9 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares after the second year is:

\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

Final value of all Maria's shares:

"Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(2 \times 3 = 6\) hot dogs.

John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

The number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of cows be \( C \).
2. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so we can write the equation:
   \[ C + 2C = 60 \]
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[ 3C = 60 \]
5. Solving for \( C \), we find:
   \[ C = 20 \]
6. Therefore, the number of chickens is:
   \[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each.

- The total number of legs from the cows is:
  \[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
- The total number of legs from the chickens is:
  \[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

Adding these together, the total number of legs is:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

"Josh starts with juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

3 (initial balls) + 4 (balls added each week for 4 weeks) = 7 balls

However, during the performance, he drops 3 balls. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 (total balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

But 2 of those dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he still has:

4 (remaining balls) - 2 (caught balls) = 2 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle with 2 balls.

"Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can use this information to find the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
2. The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 20 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
\[ 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ cookies/week} + 7 \text{ cookies/week} = 27 \text{ cookies/week} \]

Since Jenny buys 36 cookies a week, the number of cookies Jenny eats is:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies/week} - 27 \text{ cookies/week} = 9 \text{ cookies/week} \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
2. Calculate the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts.
Total cost without discount = 2 * $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
The discount is 40%, so we need to find 40% of $60.
Discount amount = 40% of $60 = 0.40 * $60 = $24

Step 3: Subtract the discount amount from the total cost to find the final amount paid.
Final amount paid = Total cost without discount - Discount amount
Final amount paid = $60 - $24 = $36

Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts."
"To find out what percentage more the factory is making per day now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.
2. Calculate the daily revenue from silos.
3. Find the difference between the two revenues.
4. Calculate the percentage increase based on the original revenue.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day: 10
   - Price per tractor: $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

2. **Daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day: 5
   - Price per silo: $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

3. **Difference in daily revenue:**
   - Difference = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   - Difference = $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day

4. **Percentage increase:**
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Original revenue) * 100%
   - Percentage increase = ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 0.1 * 100% = 10%

The factory is making 10% more per day now compared to when they were making tractors."

"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time of the vacation as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, and then see how many friends can be included within her $90 budget.

First, let's calculate the cost for one person:
- One round of mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

Total cost for one person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, let's subtract the cost for Morgan from the total budget to find out how much is left for her friends:
- Total budget: $90
- Cost for Morgan: $30

Amount left for friends = $90 - $30 = $60

Now, we need to find out how many friends can be included with the remaining $60. Since each friend also needs to pay $30, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per person:
- Amount left for friends: $60
- Cost per friend: $30

Number of friends = $60 / $30 = 2

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money he has left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - He spends this money on gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - He buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, half of his remaining money is $2, which means his remaining money is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Set up the equation to find the amount of money left after buying the candy:**
   - We know that after buying the candy, he has $4 left.
   - So, \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, which is \(75 + 100 = 175\) miles. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily travel distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed:
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

4. Add the amounts together to get the total amount of stuffing needed:
   - Total stuffing = stuffing for chihuahua beds + stuffing for collie beds
   - Total stuffing = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds."

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
49"
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice the number of boys, then there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys in the park.

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add the points she has already scored and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the minimum total of 42 points.

Points from the first test: 15
Points from the second test: 18

Total points from the first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33

To find the minimum points needed on the third test, we subtract the total points from the first two tests from the required total:

42 - 33 = 9

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. 

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, we calculate:
   \[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[ 3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50 \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[ 31 + x = 50 \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = 50 - 31 \]
   \[ x = 19 \]

So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 19.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sara's current score is 8 points.
2. Erin's current score is three times Sara's score, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) points.
3. Erin scored 14 points to reach her current score of 24 points.

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring those 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current score of 24 points.

So, \(24 - 14 = 10\).

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Additional cost for etching each frame is 20% of $20, which is $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - For 44 seniors, the total cost for picture frames and etching = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of picture frames and etching + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
- Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:
$1198"
"The cost of the hand-painted wallpaper at the market is $400. If Ethan makes his own wallpaper, he saves 20% on the materials cost.

To find the savings, we calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 20\% \times 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper.

To find the total cost of making his own wallpaper, we subtract the savings from the original cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double that number, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount of Saturday, which is:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on the last day is:
\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the total number of pairs sold during the sale, we add the pairs sold on each day:
\[ 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the interest on the loan and the total amount she will pay back over the five months. The formula for the monthly payment on a simple interest loan is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{\text{Number of Payments}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Rate (R) = 10% per year = 0.10 per year
- Time (T) = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years
- Number of Payments = 5

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}}{5} = \frac{3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3650 \times 0.04167}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{152.0855}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 30.4171 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 30.42 \]

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine how many hours it will take for Millie to sell all 36 cups of lemonade. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue. The cost of the supplies is $18, so:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

This is the total profit for the entire period. To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who can make it to the performance is:

Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls:

Total number of people who sang in the performance = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The savings for David is \(36 - 30 = $6\).

David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to determine the total cost of the streaming services he is getting.

1. Netflix costs $10 a month.
2. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost is reduced.

First, let's calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The original cost for both is $10 each, so together it's $20.
- A 20% discount on $20 is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- So, the discounted cost for both is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add up the costs of all the streaming services:
- Netflix: $10
- Hulu and Disney Plus (discounted): $16
- Total cost of streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package to find out how much Tim saves:

First, let's calculate the energy used per day before and after the reduction:

- Original daily energy usage: \(8 \text{ hours/day} \times 900 \text{ watts/hour} = 7200 \text{ watts/day}\)
- Reduced daily energy usage: \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 900 \text{ watts/hour} = 2700 \text{ watts/day}\)

The energy saved per day is:
\[7200 \text{ watts/day} - 2700 \text{ watts/day} = 4500 \text{ watts/day}\]

To convert this to kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts):
\[4500 \text{ watts/day} = 4.5 \text{ kilowatts/day}\]

Now, to find out how much energy is saved in 30 days:
\[4.5 \text{ kilowatts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kilowatts}\]

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. A zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Total number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

Finally, we calculate the average number of stripes:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To serve 20 people, Tyson would need to make:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so for 5 sandwiches, he would need:

\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of meat per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound of cheese per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

The cost of the meat and cheese would be:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Allan initially has 40 cannolis in his house. 

Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which means he bought:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ corns} \]

So, the new total of corns is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog and then subtract that from the total steps he needed to reach 10,000.

Total steps needed: 10,000
Steps taken before the jog: 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (short walk with friend) = 6,000
Steps left after the jog: 2,000

So, the steps taken during the jog can be calculated as follows:

10,000 (total steps) - 6,000 (steps before jog) - 2,000 (steps left after jog) = 2,000 steps

Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for May = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for May = 40 × $15 × 40
Total payment for May = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June.
- Number of employees who left = 1/4 × 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Number of employees in June: 30
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked per week: 40

Total payment for June = Number of employees × Hourly wage × Hours worked per week
Total payment for June = 30 × $15 × 40
Total payment for June = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

Total payment for May and June = Total payment for May + Total payment for June
Total payment for May and June = $24,000 + $18,000
Total payment for May and June = $42,000

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that the second pound of taffy is half the price of the first pound, which is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
\[ \$3 + \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25:
\[ 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the expenses:
\[ \$4.50 + \$1.50 + \$1.00 = \$7.00 \]

Sally started with $10.00, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$7.00 = \$3.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3.00 \]"
"Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much, which is $800. The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:

$400 + $800 = $1200

He gets a 20% discount on these fireworks, so the discount amount is:

20% of $1200 = 0.20 * $1200 = $240

The cost of the fireworks after the discount is:

$1200 - $240 = $960

He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Therefore, the total amount he spent is:

$960 + $150 = $1110

"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night and wants enough cookies to last her for 30 days. 

First, we calculate the total number of cookies she will eat in 30 days:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make to have 60 cookies in total.

60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to have enough for 30 days.

5 dozens"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the information provided does not specify the percentage of candles that will explode. We only know that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and that Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode. 

Given that Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode, we can infer that 1% of the candles are expected to explode. But we don't have information on how many of the candles are considered ""more dangerous"" or what percentage of all candles are ""more dangerous.""

Assuming that the 5% of ""more dangerous"" candles that smell like wet dog are a subset of the 1% of candles that are expected to explode, we can proceed with the following calculation:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode: \(50000 \times 0.01 = 500\)
2. Calculate the number of candles that are ""more dangerous"" and smell like wet dog: \(50000 \times 0.05 = 2500\)

Since we are assuming that all ""more dangerous"" candles that smell like wet dog are also expected to explode, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are expected to explode is the smaller of the two numbers calculated above, which is 500 (the number of candles expected to explode).

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and are expected to explode is 500.

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

Step 1: Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
The regular price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount on each blouse is 30% of $20.

\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

The discount price of one blouse is $20 - $6 = $14.

Step 2: Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses.
Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

The total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact number yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
4. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
5. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
6. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.
7. The combined total of apples gathered by both is 500.

Now, let's write an equation for the total number of apples gathered:

\[ \text{Joanne's apples} + \text{Sister's apples} = 500 \]

Joanne's apples are:

\[ 30 + 15 + x \]

Sister's apples are:

\[ 60 + 45 + 0 = 105 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]

\[ x = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

Final numerical answer:
350"
"Let's denote the number of camels as \( C \) and the number of dromedaries as \( D \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( C + D = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2C + D = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( D \) from the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]

Next, we substitute \( D \) in the second equation:
\[ 2C + (180 - C) = 304 \]
\[ 2C + 180 - C = 304 \]
\[ C + 180 = 304 \]
\[ C = 304 - 180 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can find \( D \) using the first equation:
\[ D = 180 - C \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day, so the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{km} \]

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first four days, which is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} \times 0.30 = 240 \, \text{km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \, \text{km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet). Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb the difference in elevation between his current position and where the comb is located.

The calculation is as follows:

6,000 feet (elevation of the comb) - 3,000 feet (Oliver's elevation) = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \(3/5\) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."

3. **The remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months, and 6 + 8 = 14 months, so 24 - 14 = 10 months, but we only need 8 more to complete 2 years) at $14 a month:**
   \[ 8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256 \]

The total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \$256 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know that \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of the total savings, and the savings from the tattered jeans is 2/3 of the total savings. The total savings is $6.

So, we can write the following equations:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = J - 22 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 28 - T \]

Simplifying these equations:
\[ 2 = J - 22 \]
\[ 4 = 28 - T \]

Solving for \( J \) and \( T \):
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]
\[ T = 28 - 4 = 24 \]

However, we already know that the original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, but based on the given conditions, it seems there's a misunderstanding because the original price of the jogger jeans is actually $22, not $24.

So, the correct original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the tattered jeans are $28. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

2. The 6 minibusses can each hold 30 employees, so the total capacity for the minibusses is:
   \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

3. The 10 minivans can each hold 15 employees, so the total capacity for the minivans is:
   \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, which means the homemade feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is 3 * 20 = 60 birds, and the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

Therefore, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After keeping 1/3 of the cards and spending $50, he has $100 for the ticket and $50 in spending cash, which totals $150.

So, the equation for the money he has after selling the cards is:
\[ x = 100 + 50 \]
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is 150.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The caterer was initially told to prepare for 36 guests.
2. He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs. So, for 36 guests, half would be 18 guests, and these 18 guests would get 2 hotdogs each, which means 36 hotdogs for these 18 guests.
3. The remaining 18 guests would get 1 hotdog each, which means 18 more hotdogs.
4. So, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 (for the first 18 guests) + 18 (for the remaining 18 guests) = 54 hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. This means that the first hotdog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and now they all want a second one.

5. Since there were 54 hotdogs prepared, and 40 guests each had a first hotdog, there are 54 - 40 = 14 hotdogs left for seconds.

6. Since 40 guests all want a second hotdog and only 14 are available, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 40 - 14 = 26.

Final numerical answer:
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's calculate the amount of money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, and he spent 99% of his money, we can calculate the remaining 1% of $5:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount spent is:
\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

We already know that $1.20 was spent on chips, so the amount spent on candy bars is:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many candy bars George bought. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75. So, the number of candy bars he bought is:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his four friends.

To find out how many lollipops each friend received, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

Each of his friends received 5 lollipops.

Final numerical answer:

"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so they have taken 2 pieces in total. 

Each piece would weigh \( \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \).

Together, Rory and her mom have \( 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \).

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs \( 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \).

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris together have 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.

They want to share these oranges equally among themselves and their 6 other friends, which makes a total of 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people.

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]"
"Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes. Since Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, her drive takes 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

Final numerical answer:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

First, let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought:

Elizabeth's total beads:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference: 140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final answer:
59"
"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
   - The horse runs for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 32 MPH × 0.5 hours = 16 miles

2. **Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - Hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 a bail per mile = 8 bails of hay

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay:**
   - A bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost of hay = 8 bails × $3 per bail = $24

4. **Calculate the amount of money Michael has:**
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills.
   - Total money = 6 × $5 = $30

5. **Calculate the change after buying the hay:**
   - Change = Total money - Total cost of hay
   - Change = $30 - $24 = $6

**Final numerical answer:**

"Rozanne starts with 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we need to calculate the total points for both Joey and Marcy after their respective turns and then find the difference between their scores.

First, let's calculate Joey's total points:
- Joey starts with 214 points.
- He scores an additional 26 points.
- Therefore, Joey's total points are \(214 + 26 = 240\).

Next, let's calculate Marcy's total points:
- Marcy starts with 225 points.
- She scores an additional 10 points.
- Therefore, Marcy's total points are \(225 + 10 = 235\).

Now, we find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's total points to determine by how many points Joey is winning:
- Joey's total points: 240
- Marcy's total points: 235
- The difference is \(240 - 235 = 5\).

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points."
"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
   = $576 / 48
   = $12 per sneaker

Next, we calculate the revenue from the flash sale:

2. Revenue from the flash sale = Number of sneakers sold at the flash sale * Price per sneaker
   = 17 * $20
   = $340

Now, we calculate the revenue from the department store:

3. Number of sneakers sold to the department store = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold at the flash sale
   = 48 - 17
   = 31 sneakers

4. Revenue from the department store = Number of sneakers * Price per sneaker
   = 31 * $25
   = $775

Now, we calculate the total revenue:

5. Total revenue = Revenue from the flash sale + Revenue from the department store
   = $340 + $775
   = $1115

Finally, we calculate the profit:

6. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $1115 - $576
   = $539

The salesman's profit is $539."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket for any movie: $20
2. Super ticket includes popcorn and soda for $1 extra: $20 + $1 = $21
3. Regular ticket for any movie: $12
4. Regular ticket + popcorn + soda: $12 + regular price of popcorn + $3 (soda)
5. You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

The cost of the super ticket is:
\[ 21 \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket plus popcorn and soda is $2 more than the super ticket:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 + 2 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \):
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 23 \]
\[ 15 + P = 23 \]
\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

The regular price of popcorn is $8.

"To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:

1. At 60 mph for 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

2. At 30 mph for 1 hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, let's find the total distance:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, let's find the total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we can calculate the average speed:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."

"First, we need to calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]
\[ \text{Total volume of soil} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags required is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in the class.
   - Each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Therefore, the total number of pencils at the start is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.
   - The number of pencils used is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \).
   - The number of pencils remaining after two months is \( 300 - 60 = 240 \).

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.
   - The number of pencils left is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \).

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is **80**."
"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 80

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to determine how many are allergic to at least one of the substances.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Final answer:

"The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so for both Tom and his wife, the cost is:

\[ 2 \times \$5000 = \$10000 \]

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. First, we calculate 20% of $1500:

\[ 0.20 \times \$1500 = \$300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:

\[ \$1500 + \$300 = \$1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \$10000 + \$5400 = \$15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \$15400 \]"
"Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint.

Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, which means Jasper has \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) tubes of blue paint.

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, which means Jasper has \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) tubes of yellow paint.

Therefore, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is \( 2 + 9 = 11 \).

The combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"To find out how much more Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal, we first add the amounts they have already earned:

Keegan's earnings: $83
Tashay's earnings: $91

Total earned: $83 + $91 = $174

Their goal is $200, so we subtract the total they have earned from their goal:

$200 - $174 = $26

They need to earn $26 more to reach their goal."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs on her player.

The maximum capacity of each player is 100 songs. Therefore, the number of songs Gabriel can still add to his player is \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.

Similarly, the number of songs Luri can still add to her player is \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

\(80 - 40 = 40\)

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his."

"James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. 

First, we calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Since he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, we can find the total hours he runs in a week by dividing the total miles by his speed:
60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Therefore, James runs a total of 6 hours a week."
"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse consumes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds of oats per day.
3. Uncle Ben has four horses, so the total consumption per day for all horses is \(10 \times 4 = 40\) pounds of oats.
4. For five days, the total consumption is \(40 \times 5 = 200\) pounds of oats.
5. Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200}{50} = 4\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.

"To find the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of 2 packs of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - She is buying 2 packs.
   - Total cost before discounts = 2 packs * $4.00/pack = $8.00.

2. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" sale:**
   - Since the offer is ""buy one get one free,"" she only pays for 1 pack and gets the second one free.
   - Cost after the sale = $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - Subtract the coupon from the sale price.
   - Cost after the coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Total number of razors = 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.
   - Cost per razor = Total cost after discounts / Total number of razors = $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25/razor.

5. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."
"To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to identify the height of the shortest cheerleader, as she will be at the top of the pyramid. According to the information provided, 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. Therefore, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be equal to the height of the shortest cheerleader, since she is at the top and the question does not specify any additional height from the pyramid structure itself.

60 inches

The height of the human pyramid is 60 inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 for each guest. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per person, and food is already included, so the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), for which the costs are equal. So we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):

\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Daily calorie deficit
To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories to burn by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day and worked for an entire week, which is 7 days. So, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

He has $110 left."
"To find out how many milliliters of water Hannah will need to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Hannah will run.
2. Determine the total amount of water she needs based on the distance.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance.
Hannah runs 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, the total distance is:
\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of water.
Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 km, she will need:
\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of it on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

So, after buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

So, after buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each for $4 per pack. 

First, we calculate the total cost of the bags:
8 packs * $4/pack = $32

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:
8 packs * 5 bags/pack * $8/bag = 40 bags * $8/bag = $320

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$320 - $32 = $288

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $288 on her bags."
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time he spent throwing punches and then multiply that by his average rate of throwing punches.

1. Calculate the total time of the fight:
   - Each round lasts 3 minutes.
   - There are 5 rounds.
   - Total time = 3 minutes/round * 5 rounds = 15 minutes.

2. Calculate the total number of punches:
   - Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
   - Total time = 15 minutes.
   - Total punches = 25 punches/minute * 15 minutes = 375 punches.

Therefore, Joe threw 375 punches."
"Suzanne made 36 cookies. 

Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars. This leaves Ali with \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

Subtracting the amount used for dinner from the remaining money, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"If Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, that's equivalent to 120 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).

Double the time Rob takes would be 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time, so:

240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we first calculate the number of skeins required for one set of winter wear and then multiply by the number of grandchildren.

For one set of winter wear:
- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Total for one set = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins

Since Martha is making these for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total for one set by 3:

Total for 3 sets = 21 * 3 = 63 skeins

Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool."

3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) problems.
4. After Monday and Tuesday, the number of problems left is \(100 - 12 - 36 = 52\).
5. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\) problems.
6. After Wednesday, the number of problems left is \(52 - 13 = 39\).

So, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we add their individual rates together:

\[6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon, so they sold a total of:

93 + 39 = 132 loaves.

After selling 132 loaves, the number of loaves left would be:

200 - 132 = 68 loaves.

Then, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so the total number of loaves left would be:

68 + 6 = 74 loaves.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) rows.

Next, let's calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \) rows.

Now, we add the number of rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips to find the total number of rows:
- Total number of rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9 rows.

The final numerical answer is:
9 rows"
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cups of raisins will be used for each of the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix) if the raisins are divided equally.
2. Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies that can be made with the raisins allocated for the cookies.

First, since the raisins are divided equally among the three items, each item will get:
\[ \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies takes \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a cup of raisins, the number of batches is:
\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ada's current daily electric consumption.
2. Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device.
3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption after adding the new device will be:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]
3. The weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week}
   \]
   The weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is:
   \[

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house (since 10 days is double the time to paint half a house).

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the rate of painting per person per day. The rate is:

\[ \text{Rate per person per day} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} \]

If we have 5 people working together, their combined rate would be:

\[ \text{Combined rate for 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day} \]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. Therefore, to paint a whole house, it would take them:

\[ \text{Time to paint a whole house} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 * 22 = 66 chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:

Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas: 20 + 64 = 84
Total number of chairs: 22 + 66 = 88

Total number of sofas and chairs: 84 + 88 = 172

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This remaining $4 is exactly the cost of one CD. Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we need to subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, he worked out for 4 hours in \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\) weeks.

Now, we can calculate the total hours:

- For the 5 weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours
- For the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

\[20 + 10 + 6 = 36\]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is 36 hours."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine Jame's current age. If Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, then his current age is:
   \[
   27 - 5 = 22
   \]
   So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

2. Next, we need to determine the age of Jame's cousin in 8 years. We know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. First, we calculate Jame's age in 8 years:
   \[
   22 + 8 = 30
   \]
   Twice Jame's age in 8 years is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be:
   \[
   60 - 5 = 55
   \]
   Therefore, Jame's cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years.

3. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55:
   \[
   55 - 8 = 47
   \]
   So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many years separate the age of the two now. We subtract Jame's current age from his cousin's current age:
   \[
   47 - 22 = 25

"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.
- Therefore, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation to find the cost of the monitors:
- Cost of computer + Cost of printer + 2 * Cost of one monitor = Total cost
- $1,100 + $700 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Simplifying the equation:
- $1,800 + 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400

Subtract $1,800 from both sides:
- 2 * Cost of one monitor = $2,400 - $1,800
- 2 * Cost of one monitor = $600

Divide both sides by 2:
- Cost of one monitor = $600 / 2
- Cost of one monitor = $300

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these up:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target of $1125.

April has 30 days, so the first half of the month consists of the first 15 days and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

Let's denote the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, in the first half of April, he saves \( 15x \).

According to the problem, in the second half of April, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day as he does in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) each day in the second half. Therefore, in the second half of April, he will save \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

The total amount saved in April is the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half, which should equal his target of $1125. So we can write the equation:

\[ 15x + 30x = 1125 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 45:

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. Since he wants to save twice as much each day in the second half, he will save:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 50 \]"
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth, as the number of families notified increases by a factor of 3 with each round.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, those 3 families each call 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families are notified.
3. In the third round, the 9 families each call 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) new families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, the 27 families each call 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) new families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

His final weight was 70 pounds, so his initial weight was:
70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[ 80 \times 5 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400, so we can write the equation:
   \[ x + 2 = 400 \]

3. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[ x = 400 - 2 \]
   \[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

Final numerical answer:
398"
"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the notebooks:
   - 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50

2. Calculate the cost of the pens:
   - 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

3. Calculate the cost of the calculator:
   - 1 calculator at $12 each = $12.00

4. Calculate the cost of the geometry set:
   - 1 geometry set at $10 each = $10.00

5. Add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
   - Total = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

6. Apply the 10% discount:
   - Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

7. Subtract the discount from the total to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
   - Final amount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."
"To find out how much change Carly gets back, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered.

1. The cost of the hamburgers: \(5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ each} = \$20\)
2. The cost of the potato fries: \(10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ each} = \$3\)
3. The cost of the fruit drinks: \(5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ each} = \$10\)

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33

"To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission:
   \[ \text{Commission for first } \$1000 = 1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

2. For the amount over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   \[ \text{Commission for the amount over } \$1000 = 1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

3. Adding both commissions together gives the total amount earned:
   \[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed for the guests is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, we first calculate twice the time it takes him in cold water:

\[ 2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Then we add 2 minutes to that:

\[ 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, on a hot day, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we first calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in each condition:

On a cold day:
\[ 3 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

On a hot day:
\[ 3 \times 34 \text{ minutes} = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time:

\[ 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Days per Week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 2 \times 5 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 40 \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to Save}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{80}{40} \]
\[ \text{Number of Weeks} = 2 \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost of your lunch today at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub first, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

The cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub to find the total cost of your lunch:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost of your lunch today at Subway is $160."
"To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes separately, and then add them together.

First, we know that there are 7 buttons with 2 holes each. So, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Next, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the remaining buttons are:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

These 14 buttons each have 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both groups of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is:

"The pet shop had 6 cages of rodents in total. 

3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.

The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents.

The pet shop had a total of 45 rodents."
"Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs:
150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs:
2 * 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:
(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the initial angle of the pyramid and the movement of the sun over time.

1. The initial angle of the pyramid from the ground is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward.
3. The sun moves for 10 hours.

The total movement of the sun in 10 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, and it moves 50 degrees straight upward, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 82 \text{ degrees} \]"
"The first step is to determine the ages of James's sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the second son is:

12 - 4 = 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many candles James needs. Since he has two sons, he needs:

1 candle for the 12-year-old son + 1 candle for the 8-year-old son = 2 candles.

Now, we need to determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy. Since each pack contains 5 candles, and he only needs 2 candles, he can buy a pack that contains 2 candles or less. However, since the candles are sold in packs of 5, he will need to buy 1 pack of 5 candles to have enough for both sons.

The cost of one pack of 5 candles is $3. Therefore, the total amount James spends on candles is:

$3.

Final numerical answer:
$3"
"In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:

\[ \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/page pair}} \times 2 \text{ pages/page pair} = 70 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 per tooth, so that's $1.00 * 3 = $3.00. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So for the last two teeth, Sharon received $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per month.
4. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
5. Find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week, so in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: Now, we find the difference between the number of roses Ford grows in a month and the number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account."
"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Calculate the cost per sandwich:**
   - Cost of bread per loaf: $3.00
   - Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
   - Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches: $30.00, so the cost per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.
   - Total cost per sandwich: $0.30 (bread) + $3.00 (cheese and condiments) = $3.30.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue for 10 sandwiches is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. This starting value plus half the number is divided by 5.
3. The resulting value is then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Let's denote the starting value as \( x \). In this case, \( x = 20 \).

Step 1: Calculate half of the starting value.
\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Step 2: Add this value to the starting value and then divide by 5.
\[ \frac{x + \frac{x}{2}}{5} = \frac{20 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

Step 3: Multiply this result by the starting value minus 12.
\[ 6 \times (x - 12) = 6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. The difference between the set temperature and the actual temperature is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage by which the oven is off is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to determine what temperature would result in the oven being 4% too hot and equal to 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The oven will then be 4% too hot, so it will read:

\[ x + 0.04x = 1.04x \]

We want this to equal 520 degrees:

\[ 1.04x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:

Next, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought. Judy brought 24 dishes, so her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both Judy and her friend is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost for 2 boxes is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill:
- They are paid $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:

Total water needed (in ml) = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 8 * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the three typing speeds:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we calculate the average of these three measurements:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and eating Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's sum up all the attendees:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats."
"The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.

The Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
\[ \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
\[ \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
\[ \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds} \]

The Mastiff weighed 220 pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on Amazon:
- Cost of boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the boots on eBay:
- Cost of boots: $13
- Shipping cost: $4 * 2 = $8 (since it's twice the cost of Amazon's shipping)
- Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

Now, we find the difference in total cost between eBay and Amazon:
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet required to be taller than Mark's window.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

Step 1: Since 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, 200 grams (which is double the amount) will contain double the protein:
\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

Step 2: John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so in a week (7 days), he will consume:
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Each gumball costs a nickel, so we need to find out how many nickels he has in total.

Colby has:
- 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, so 8 quarters = 8 * 25 = 200 cents
- 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, so 6 dimes = 6 * 10 = 60 cents
- 14 nickels, which are worth 5 cents each, so 14 nickels = 14 * 5 = 70 cents
- 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, so 15 pennies = 15 * 1 = 15 cents

Now, we add up all the money Colby has:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we divide the total amount of money by 5 to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy:
345 cents / 5 cents per gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + (0.50 \times 8 \text{ pounds}) = 8 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for a year, which is 12 games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for a year, which is 24 games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for a year, which is 48 games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, which is 15 games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games bought in the first year: 12
- Games bought in the second year: 24
- Games bought in the third year: 48

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. The speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken.

Given:
- Distance traveled = 1200 miles
- Time taken = 3 hours

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour

Now, we need to find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.

Additional distance to be traveled = 2000 miles
Speed of the plane = 400 miles per hour

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles at the same rate."
"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate how many pounds of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
\[ 1800 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:

\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. So, the amount of money he has left is:

\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

1. For the first four hours:
   - He sold 15 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.50.
   - Total cups sold in 4 hours = 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups.
   - Total earnings from the first 4 hours = 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $30.

2. For the next two hours:
   - He sold 10 cups per hour.
   - The price per cup was $0.60.
   - Total cups sold in 2 hours = 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.
   - Total earnings from the next 2 hours = 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $12.

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to get the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month.
2. Calculate the total number of rotations per year.
3. Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per month.**

Given that the car drives 2 miles and the tires rotate 725 times, we can find the number of rotations per mile by dividing the number of rotations by the number of miles:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so the total number of rotations per month is:

\[ \text{Rotations per month} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \times 400 \text{ miles} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations per year.**

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of rotations per year is:

\[ \text{Rotations per year} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:

\[ \text{Years before replacement} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in 6 years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents (1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we can find the cost per pump by multiplying the cost per washing by the number of washings per pump:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 20 \text{ cents} \times 60 = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, this is the total cost for 60 washings, so the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{1200 \text{ cents}}{60} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the discount on the shirt:**
   - The original price of the shirt is $25.
   - The discount is 30%, so the discount amount is \( 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \).
   - The sale price of the shirt is \( 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts:**
   - The sale price of the shirt is $17.50.
   - The price of the shorts is $35.
   - The total cost before tax is \( 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \).

3. **Determine if the total cost exceeds Joe's budget:**
   - Joe has $50.
   - The total cost is $52.50.
   - Since $52.50 is more than $50, Joe cannot afford the outfit with the given budget.

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - Since Joe cannot afford the outfit, the remaining money is $0.

**Final Answer:**
Joe will have $0 left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so the total duration of the research is 5 * 10 = 50 months.

The first 5 months cost $100,000. For the remaining 45 months, the funding per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000. So, the funding per month for the remaining months is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.

The cost for the remaining 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.

The total cost of the research is the sum of the initial 5 months and the remaining 45 months:

$100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

93000"
"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for water in a year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the cost of each item she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches tall.

The final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is 10 inches."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To find the number of students in the school auditorium, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:**
   - There are 4 rows of seats.
   - Each row has 18 seats.
   - Therefore, the total number of seats is \(4 \times 18 = 72\).

2. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators:**
   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
   - So, the number of seats occupied by the administrators is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18\).

3. **Calculate the number of remaining seats after the administrators have taken their seats:**
   - The total number of seats is 72.
   - The number of seats occupied by the administrators is 18.
   - Therefore, the number of remaining seats is \(72 - 18 = 54\).

4. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
   - So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18\).

5. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by the students:**
   - The rest of the seats were occupied by the students.
   - The number of seats occupied by the students is the remaining seats after the administrators and parents have taken their seats.
   - Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the students is \(54 - 18 = 36\).

The final numerical answer is:
36"
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

Both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break."
"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, each week he had 2 sessions of 2 hours each, which totals 4 hours per week.

The cost per hour for the sessions is $125.

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spent in therapy and then multiply by the cost per hour.

Total hours = 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours

Total cost = 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000

The physical therapy cost John $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- After 4 hours at school, he has \( 20 - 4 = 16 \) pieces left.
- After 1 more piece on the way home, he has \( 16 - 1 = 15 \) pieces left.
- After 1 more piece after dinner, he has \( 15 - 1 = 14 \) pieces left.

Now, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:

- He gives away \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.
- So, he has \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) pieces left.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left."

- Cost per baseball: $3
- Total cost for baseballs: 9 * $3 = $27

For the basketball coach:
- Number of basketballs bought: 8
- Cost per basketball: $14
- Total cost for basketballs: 8 * $14 = $112

Now, we find the difference in the amount spent by the two coaches:
- Difference: $112 - $27 = $85

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach."
"To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers planted in Arianna's garden.

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row. So, the total number of flowers is:

\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers/row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

\[ 200 \text{ flowers} \times \frac{4}{5} = 160 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed in Arianna's garden is:

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"The tow truck pulled ten cars each day for the first three days, and then four fewer cars each day for the remaining four days of the week.

For the first three days:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

For the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars each day:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

So for the last four days:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the number of cars towed over the entire week:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

The total number of cars towed that week is 54."
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To calculate how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Total Revenue from Selling the Cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times (25,000 \times 0.30) = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Profit:**
   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}

"Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we first calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:

25% of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders

Of these 25 riders who can stay upright, 60% are women. Therefore, the remaining 40% must be men:

40% of 25 = 0.40 * 25 = 10 men

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is $4800."
"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."
"Naomi caught 17 fish.

Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught:

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to first calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, so the cost per class is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (noting that \( 10 - x \) is positive for \( x < 10 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10, and remember to reverse the inequality sign:

\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, \( x \leq 4 \). This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many customers Julie processes per day.
2. Calculate the total number of customers each processes in a week.
3. Sum the weekly totals for both Julie and Jewel.

First, we know that Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel. Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

Next, we calculate the weekly production for each:
- Jewel processes 50 customers per day, so in a week (7 days), she processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
- Julie processes 100 customers per day, so in a week, she processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Adding these together, the total weekly production for the two is \(350 + 700 = 1050\).

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. Calculate the cost of one apple:
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add the base price of the truck to the cost of each of the additional features.

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7500 = 2500
   \]
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500
\]

Let's do the addition step by step:
\[
30000 + 7500 = 37500
\]
\[
37500 + 2500 = 40000
\]
\[
40000 + 2000 = 42000
\]
\[
42000 + 1500 = 43500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

Original salary: $20,000
Raise: 5% of $20,000 = 0.05 * $20,000 = $1,000

New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

Next, we calculate the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

Bonus: 0.5 * $20,000 = $10,000

Now, we add the bonus to the new monthly salary to get the total monthly income:

Total monthly income: $21,000 + $10,000 = $31,000

To find out how much Tim will make in a year, we multiply the total monthly income by 12 (months in a year):

Annual income: $31,000 * 12 = $372,000

Therefore, Tim will make $372,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, the dress pants, and the dress shirts, and then sum these amounts.

1. **Cost of the suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7500.

2. **Cost of the dress pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs 1/5 the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = $750 / 5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1500.

3. **Cost of the dress shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 dress shirts * $60/dress shirt = $1800.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts.
   - Total cost = $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.

The final numerical answer is:

- Total cost before the voucher: \(20 \times 20 = 400\) dollars.
- Clara got a $2 discount with her voucher.
- Total cost after the voucher: \(400 - 2 = 398\) dollars.

**Sheila's Purchase:**
- The next day, the price of pomegranates shot to $30 each.
- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each.
- Total cost before the discount: \(20 \times 30 = 600\) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- Discount amount: \(600 \times 0.10 = 60\) dollars.
- Total cost after the discount: \(600 - 60 = 540\) dollars.

**Difference in Final Prices:**
- Clara's final price: $398
- Sheila's final price: $540
- Difference: \(540 - 398 = 142\) dollars.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is **142 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Final numerical answer:
2100"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost for the 3 hours:

$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105

So, James paid $105."
"Sally's bank account increased from $200 to $420 during the week. This means she received an additional $220 in the week. Since her weekly wage should be $300, the amount withheld from her wage is the difference between what she should have received and what she actually received.

To find the amount withheld, we subtract the amount she actually received from her expected wage:

$300 (expected wage) - $220 (actual amount received) = $80

So, $80 were withheld from Sally’s wage.

The final numerical answer is:
$80"
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
2. Determine the number of whole eggs required.
3. Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and there are 16 guests.
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.
Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.
There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

Final answer:
\[ 2 \text{ dozens} \]"
"Shiela has already written 1/3 of the 15-page research paper. To find out how many pages she has left to write, we first calculate how many pages she has already completed:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages} \]

Since the total length of the paper is 15 pages, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total:

\[ 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages} \]

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write."
"Mike plans to read 10 pages a day. The book has 200 pages.

To find out how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he plans to read each day:

200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days

Mike will finish his reading in 20 days.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline, as the assignment is to be completed within 30 days."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly cost for the hanger: $5,000
3. Monthly cost for fuel: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost for hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. The time to cook pork is 20 minutes more than the time to cook rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the time to cook pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. The time to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, the time to cook beans is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:
   \[
   30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

The total cooking time for all the food is 120 minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

The final numerical answer is:

3 dollars"
"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm."
"The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound, but Roger had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the more expensive brand:
20% of $5 is \( 0.20 \times 5 = $1 \).

So, the more expensive brand costs \( $5 + $1 = $6 \) per pound.

Roger buys a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. Therefore, he buys 7 pounds of coffee.

The cost of 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is \( 7 \times $6 = $42 \).

He also buys himself a donut for $2.

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the coffee and the donut:
\( $42 + $2 = $44 \).

Therefore, the total cost is $44."
"To find the cost of the apple pie, we need to subtract the cost of the other items Gus bought from the total amount he spent.

1. Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
2. Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
3. Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Gus spent a total of \$20.00, so the cost of the apple pie is:

\(\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00\)

The apple pie cost \$7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

Total newspapers delivered in a day = 600
Newspapers delivered to District A = 198
Newspapers delivered to District C = 209

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (Newspapers to District A + Newspapers to District C)

Let's calculate:

Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - 407
Newspapers delivered to District B = 193

James delivers 193 newspapers to District B."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class:

- The class meets 4 times a week.
- Each session is 2 hours long.
- The class lasts for 6 weeks.

So, the total number of hours is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, we divide the total hours by 1.5:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"First, let's find out how many of the 150 teachers are history teachers. 

60% of 150 teachers are history teachers, so we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \text{ history teachers} \]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ math teachers} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ math teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"Given that Aurelia has $120, we can determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna's money is:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[ \text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have $120 if they decided to share the money equally."
"The game is typically 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long, which totals:

4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes

"Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records. According to the information provided:

- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The following 8 days were neutral.
- The last 6 days (since 30 - 24 = 6) were 3 good, 1 neutral, and 2 good.

So, let's calculate the number of good days:

- Good days in the first 8 days: 8
- Good days in the last 6 days: 3 (good, neutral, good, good)

Total good days = 8 (first 8 days) + 3 (last 6 days) = 11

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 11."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

9"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

12 days"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.
3. James buys 12 toys for these 12 dogs.
4. When he returns, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left, meaning the number of dogs has doubled. So, the new total number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
5. To accommodate these 24 dogs, James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.
6. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
7. Since he no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, he doesn't need to buy any more toys.

Now, let's sum up the total number of toys James needs:

- Initially, he had 4 toys.
- He bought 12 more toys for the 8 additional dogs.
- He then bought 12 more toys to accommodate the doubled number of dogs.
- No additional toys were needed when 3 dogs left.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 4 (initial) + 12 (first purchase) + 12 (second purchase) = 28 toys.

Total number of toys James needs: 28"

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4x + 28 = 44 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 16 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the younger triplet is 4 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old."
"To determine how many minutes John has to nap, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his homework and then subtract that from the 3 hours he has before he has to eat dinner.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Manolo bought five lollipops, so the cost of the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Next, we know that the total cost of four candies and five lollipops is $3.20. Since we already calculated that the five lollipops cost $2.00, we can find the cost of the four candies by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of four candies is $1.20. To find the cost of one candy, we divide by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.00 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Neil saves per month. Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong. Since Rong saves 20 coins per month, Neil saves:

\[ 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins each person has saved over ten years. There are 12 months in a year, so over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for Rong and Neil over these 120 months.

For Rong:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

For Neil:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Finally, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil to find the combined total:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:

5760"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and the dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = $20 * 2 = $40.

2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).

3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write:
   - \( x = 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill} \).

4. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   - Total Bill = $40 + \( x \).

5. Substitute \( x \) from step 3 into the equation for the total bill:
   - Total Bill = $40 + 0.60 \times \text{Total Bill}.

6. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). So, we have:
   - \( T = 40 + 0.60T \).

7. Solve for \( T \):
   - \( T - 0.60T = 40 \),
   - \( 0.40T = 40 \),
   - \( T = \frac{40}{0.40} \),
   - \( T = 100 \).

So, the total bill is $100.

8. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   - Amount left = $125 - $100 = $25.

Therefore, John leaves with $25."
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = \$1.0\).
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = \$5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = \$6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.0.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = \$3.0\).
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = \$21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0

The price for such a crate of fruit is **$32.0**."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 4 more than red squares, so \(14 + 4 = 18\)
3. Green squares: 6 more than blue squares, so \(18 + 6 = 24\)
4. White squares: 12 fewer than green squares, so \(24 - 12 = 12\)

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68\]

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

"To find the number of 8 point bucks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
2. Calculate the number of 8 point bucks from the total number of bucks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks.
50 percent of 50 deer are bucks.
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20 percent of the bucks are 8 points.
\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 8 point bucks."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:

Adam's points: 50
Betty's points: 65
Tom's points: 35
Marta's points: 105

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, the class is missing:

400 - 255 = 145 points

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

2. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

13 + 7 = 20

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since drinks and snacks cost $2 each, we can calculate the cost for drinks and snacks per seat:

Cost of drinks per seat = 2 drinks * $2/drink = $4
Cost of snacks per seat = 3 snacks * $2/snack = $6

Total cost per seat = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are 20 seats, the total cost for all the drinks and snacks is:

Total cost = 20 seats * $10/seat = $200

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks."
"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so:
\[ 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

When Gary's truck joins, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, the amount Gary's truck can haul is:
\[ 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

Therefore, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio 3:2 is 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is therefore worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald's share, being 3 parts, is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia's share, being 2 parts, is 2 * $20 = $40.

Now, if Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours to reach their goal.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract that percentage from the total percentage used by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, the industrial usage is:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\% \]

Step 2: Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then calculate the total production over 48 hours.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we need to calculate the total production over 48 hours for both types of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we add the production of both types of ice cream to get the total production:
- Total production = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"To calculate Marcus' total bill, we need to first find the cost of each type of item he ordered, then sum these costs, and finally apply the 10% discount for his loyalty card.

1. Cost of croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
3. Cost of mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Now, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, for every 3 scoops, she only pays for 2.

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 1 free (since 4 is more than 3 but less than 6, which would give her 2 free scoops). So, she would get 5 scoops in total (4 paid + 1 free).

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the given budget and deal.

"Bryce and his four friends make a total of 5 people. Each person ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate how many slices each group of friends ate.

Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group:
\[ 3 \text{ people} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:
\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
18"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then divide by 2:

\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be written as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows."
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the number of blue spools.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

The total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

The number of blue spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of her spools are blue."
"At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.

By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

The number of people remaining in line by midday is:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, since a pack of gum contains 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Since one box can make 24 smores and we need 24 smores, we need \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) box.

Therefore, they will need **1 box** of graham crackers."
"Dora is 15 years old.

First, let's calculate Dora's father's age:
Dora's father's age = 2 * Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 * 15 + 8
Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
Dora's father's age = 38

Next, let's calculate Dora's mother's age:
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4
Dora's mother's age = 34

Now, let's calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34
Total combined age = 87

The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87."

\[ 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

The total number of votes is 100. The votes for candidate C can be found by subtracting the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

Candidate C got 50 votes."
"Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:

\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have:

"To find out how many students like to play video games, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who like to bake or play basketball.
2. Subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games or play music.
3. Use the given relationship between the number of students who like to play music and those who like to play basketball to find the exact number of students who like to play video games.

Let's start with step 1:

- Number of students who like to bake: 10
- Number of students who like to play basketball: 5

Total number of students who like to bake or play basketball = 10 + 5 = 15

Now, step 2:

Total number of students in the class = 50

Number of students who like to play video games or play music = 50 - 15 = 35

For step 3, we know that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:

Number of students who like to play music = 2 * 5 = 10

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:

Number of students who like to play video games = 35 - 10 = 25

"To find out how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each park and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference between the total costs of the two amusement parks:
- The difference is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars if they choose the second amusement park over the first."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 34 large stickers left and 102 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 100 large buttons and 102 small buttons.
   - Since each large button is worth three small stickers, and each small sticker is worth one small button, the large buttons are already in the form of buttons.
   - Therefore, the total number of buttons Lorraine has is 100 large buttons + 102 small buttons = 202 buttons.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

2. Calculate the total hours of music by multiplying the total number of songs by the length of each song.

Step 1: Total number of songs in 20 playlists
\[ \text{Total songs} = 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Step 2: Total hours of music
\[ \text{Total hours} = 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

The 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours."
"First, let's calculate how many people think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Now, let's find out how many people are left after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Next, we calculate how many of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

Finally, we can find out how many people think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. So, the total number of Pomeranians is \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies, then the total number of puppies is \(\frac{18}{2/3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27\).

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total."
"Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, the total amount Jayden has now is:

$70 (initial amount) + $45 (from Ava) = $115

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 (cost of the camera) - $115 (amount Jayden has) = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:

\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:

\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{142.86} \]"
"Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends:
3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends:
5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so he spends:
1 head of lettuce * $3/head = $3

Together, they spend:
$6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14

"George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

First, find 45% of 200 bananas:
\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, the number of pears is:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 + 290 = 490 \]

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits."
"Marissa had $80 initially and spent $20 on a ball, so she had:

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so for 20 kilograms, Sam would have to spend:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Now, to find out how many books they read altogether, we add the number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:

450 (Ezra's total) + 150 (Ahmed's total) = 600 books

They have read a total of 600 books altogether."
"Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Let's calculate her earnings for each day.

**Monday:**
- She teaches for 5 hours.
- Her earnings for the hours taught: \(5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75\).
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5: \( \$75 + \$5 = \$80 \).

**Wednesday:**
- She teaches for 2 hours.
- Her earnings for the hours taught: \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30\).
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

Now, let's add her earnings from both days:
- Monday's earnings: \$80
- Wednesday's earnings: \$30

Total earnings: \( \$80 + \$30 = \$110 \).

**Final Answer:**
Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching."
"The perfume company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, which means they sold a total of \(5 \times 4 = 20\) vanilla scents.

They sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, which means they sold a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\) fruity scents.

To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

\(20 - 16 = 4\)

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents.

"Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total revenue from the eggplants is:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

To make a total of $135, the additional amount he needs from selling the ears of corn is:

$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so the price per ear of corn should be:

$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:

$3"
"Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which sums up to 12 hours in total for the weekend.

First, we subtract the time she spends reading:
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours remaining for video games and soccer.

Next, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining 9 hours:
1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours playing video games.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent playing soccer}}{\text{Total time in the weekend}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."
"Anthony initially had 50 pencils.

\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]
pencils left.

Next, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]
So, Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.

Finally, Anthony kept the remaining pencils:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Anthony kept 10 pencils."
"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time he spends driving to the museum, the time he spends driving back, and the time he spends at the museum.

1. **Time to drive to the museum:**
   - Distance to the museum: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

2. **Time to drive back:**
   - Distance back: 150 miles
   - Speed: 75 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours

3. **Time spent at the museum:**
   - Time = 6 hours

4. **Total time gone from home:**
   - Time to drive to the museum + Time spent at the museum + Time to drive back = 2 hours + 6 hours + 2 hours = 10 hours

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for a total of 10 hours."
"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately, and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the total number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the number of wheels that will be left is:
276 wheels"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies in series} \]
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so:
   \[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]
4. The remaining movies are:
   \[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies} \]
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies} \]
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so:
   \[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]
7. The remaining movies are:
   \[ 400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies} \]
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so:
   \[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Driving Distance:**
   - They drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance they drove is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Hiking Distance:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their average hiking speed was \( \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance they hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 + 30 = 255\) miles.

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \), and the time she finishes the level as \( T_e \) seconds. For Ava, we'll use \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
2. \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
3. \( T_a = T_e + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ S_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30(T_e - T_e) = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ S_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30(T_e - (T_e + 4)) = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(-4) \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 - 120 \]
\[ S_a = 10E_e + 5B_e - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ S_a - S_e = (10E_e + 5B_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ S_a - S_e = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ -25 \]

The difference between their scores is 25 points, but since we are asked for the difference and the result is negative, it means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish Bob bought as \( W \). We know that Bob bought a total of 17 fish, so we have the equation:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( W \):
\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now, add the two equations:
\[ (2O + 2W) + (O - 2W) = 34 + 5 \]
\[ 3O = 39 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

Now substitute \( O = 13 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 13 + W = 17 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature at night is 12 degrees, we need to calculate how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

The temperature needs to increase from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, which is a difference of:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the size of each group:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups are part of the 3/5 fraction that will bring back seashells. We calculate this by multiplying the total number of groups by 3/5:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing seashells} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6 \]

Each of these 6 groups has members who bring back 2 seashells each. Since each group has 9 people, the total number of seashells brought back by the members of these 6 groups is:

\[ \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{108} \]"

The discount is 25% of the original price of $40.
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the sale price.
\[ \text{Sale price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Step 3: Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike paid with to find out how much he has left over.
\[ \text{Money left over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the total number of new hires is:

20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees

The initial workforce is 200 employees, and with the new hires, the total workforce after three months is:

200 initial employees + 60 new employees = 260 employees

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total monthly salary for all employees is:

260 employees * $4000/employee = $1,040,000

To find the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

$1,040,000/month * 3 months = $3,120,000

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

$3,120,000"
"The choir plans to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice and ""Jingle Bells"" once. 

""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, so for two performances, the total time is:
150 seconds * 2 = 300 seconds

""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long, so for one performance, the total time is:
240 seconds * 1 = 240 seconds

Adding these together gives the total caroling time:
300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds

The total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Billy's initial hourly wage:**
   - Billy starts at $10 per hour.

2. **Billy's wage after 2 months:**
   - He gets a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

3. **Billy's wage on his first anniversary:**
   - He gets another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

4. **Sally's starting hourly wage:**
   - Sally's starting wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage.
   - Sally's starting wage = $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

5. **Calculating the earnings for 20 hours of work:**
   - Billy's earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * $11.50/hour = $230.
   - Sally's earnings for 20 hours = 20 hours * $10.50/hour = $210.

6. **Calculating the difference in earnings:**
   - Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings
   - Difference = $230 - $210 = $20.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally if both work 20 hours."

"To find the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the students:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 25 students.
- Each student plants 1 tree.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers:
- There are 40 classes.
- Each class has 3 teachers.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:

Therefore, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees."
"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy as \( x \).

The total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, the total hours played in the first period is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total hours played in the second period is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods gives:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
3. Both cars travel for 2 hours.

Distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
3. Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
30% of $900 = 0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.
Final amount = Total cost + Premium = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's find the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\) or 80%. Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) students pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is then:

\[
\frac{680}{1000} = 0.68

Expressed as a percentage, the overall pass rate is 68%.

The final numerical answer is:

68%"
"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. He has two bags, and each bag contains 72 chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 72 \text{ chips per bag} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:
\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips per square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
   \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\(\frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
12 gallons"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he sold more than he initially had. Then he ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after ordering the additional 100 candies and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Initial candies: 100
2. Sold candies: 150
3. Ordered more candies: 100

Total candies after ordering more: 100 (initial) + 100 (ordered) = 200

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the additional number of students that joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

She drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals picked:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, which uses up 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or lost is 18 + 3 = 21.

Subtracting the used and lost marshmallows from the original amount, we have 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.

Since they want to make S'mores equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2: 14 / 2 = 7.

Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag."

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so we have:
\[ s = 2z \]

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ s + 2s + z + z + s = 10 \]
\[ 5s = 10 \]
\[ s = 2 \]

Now, we know that the amount of salt \( s \) is 2 ounces. Therefore, the amount of oil, which is twice the amount of salt, is:
\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away. We start with the initial number of cars and subtract the number sold and given away:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food."
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:

Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.

Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards."

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.

2 * $30 = $60

And she buys a bag for $20. So the total cost of her purchases is:

$60 + $20 = $80

Subtracting the total cost of her purchases from her total money gives:

$140 - $80 = $60

Mulan has $60 left."
"Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Let's break down the production for each week:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Monthly recording time = 288 minutes.
- Monthly writing time = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes.
- Monthly makeup time = 360 minutes.

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:
288 minutes (recording) + 480 minutes (writing) + 360 minutes (makeup) = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges based on the information provided:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This cost is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, she will need to pay an additional $15.00 for each of these 2 extra mirrors.
3. Angela also needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, she will need to pay an additional $15.00 for each of these 1 extra chandelier.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, she will need to pay an additional $15.00 for each of these 10 extra pictures.

Now, let's calculate the additional costs:

- Additional cost for mirrors: 2 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: 1 chandelier * $15.00/chandelier = $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00

Adding these to the base installation cost:

- Total additional cost: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00
- Total cost: $129.00 (base installation) + $195.00 (additional items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00."

Therefore, Roy has saved:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to work through the relationships step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

40 feet"
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours. The distance covered in this part is:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from both parts of the journey:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

1. First, let's find the speed of the kangaroos. If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, then the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 3 \times 18 \]
Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

2. Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance. The speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. The time \(T\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ T = \frac{D}{\text{speed of one turtle} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{\frac{v}{2} \times 4} = \frac{54v}{2v} \times 4 = 27 \times 4 = 108 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 108 hours to cross the highway.

"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total, including the money in her purse, and then determine how much she has in her purse.

The total amount Erika has, including the money in her purse, is the reduced price of the laptop plus the extra $50 she needs:
$400 + $50 = $450

This $450 is the sum of the money she has in her purse, the $150 she was paid, and the $80 her mom gave her:
Money in purse + $150 + $80 = $450

Now, we can solve for the money in her purse:
Money in purse + $230 = $450
Money in purse = $450 - $230
Money in purse = $220

So, Erika has $220 in her purse."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
   - Adam has 3 large apples.
   - Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices from large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
   - Adam has 5 small apples.
   - Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices from small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

3. Calculate the total number of slices from all the apples:
   - The total number of slices is the sum of the slices from large and small apples.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

4. Calculate the number of slices left after Adam eats 15 slices:
   - Adam eats 15 slices.
   - Therefore, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
\[ 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters} \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
\[ 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters} \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
\[ 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters} \]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had:

$40 - $21 = $19

Craig has $19 left."
"Given:
- Jack collected 60 dishes.
- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack's total: \( 30 \) socks + \( 60 \) dishes = \( 90 \)

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time each group takes:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Performance time: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Total time per group = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission: 10 minutes

The total duration of the concert is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We need to subtract the intermission time from the total concert time to find out how much time is available for the groups to perform:
- Total concert time: 120 minutes
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

Time available for groups = 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we can determine how many groups can perform by dividing the available time by the time each group takes:
- Time available for groups: 110 minutes
- Time per group: 10 minutes

Number of groups = 110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual interest amount.
2. Calculate the total interest over 3 years.
3. Add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount.

Step 1: Determine the annual interest amount.
The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest is:
\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total interest over 3 years.
Since the interest is simple, it accumulates at the same rate each year. Over 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Step 3: Add the total interest to the original investment to get the final amount.
\[ \text{Final Amount} = \text{Original Investment} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total white shirts**: 40
2. **Total floral shirts**: 50

**White shirts with collars**:
- Half of the white shirts have collars.
- Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

**White shirts with no collars**:
- Total white shirts - White shirts with collars = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

**Floral shirts with buttons**:
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

**Floral shirts with no buttons**:
- Total floral shirts - Floral shirts with buttons = \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

**Difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars**:
- Floral shirts with no buttons - White shirts with no collars = \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.

"Let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Your age: \( x \)
- Your brother's age: \( y \)
- Your sister's age: \( z \)
- Your mom's age: \( m \)

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. You are three years younger than your brother:
\[ x = y - 3 \]

2. You are two years older than your sister:
\[ x = z + 2 \]

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age:
\[ m = 3y - 1 \]

4. The sum of all your ages is 87:
\[ x + y + z + m = 87 \]

First, we can express \( y \) and \( z \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x + 3 \]
\[ z = x - 2 \]

Now, substitute \( y \) and \( z \) into the equation for \( m \):
\[ m = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8 \]

Now, substitute \( y \), \( z \), and \( m \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[ x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87 \]

"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
Mr. Jackson has 27 students and wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks/student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
Glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
\[ \frac{54 \text{ glue sticks}}{8 \text{ glue sticks/pack}} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7. This will ensure he has enough glue sticks and some extra.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."

"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people are infected. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year, Claire would earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same time Claire earns 1 badge, Amber earns 0.5 badges. Therefore, in a year, Amber would earn:
\[ 0.5 \text{ badges/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in a year, Wendy would earn:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:

70 + 40 = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins."
"To find the total number of leftover burritos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
- There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
- Total burritos for students = 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

Step 2: Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered.
- Initial number of burritos = 600.
- Total burritos consumed = 500 (students) + 20 (Mr. George) = 520.
- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.
4. The total number of cars is 75.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52\]

Since the total number of cars is 75, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:

\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23."
"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F + 25 = 85 \]
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( A \) from the third equation into the equation above:
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

Final answer:
Fawn has 28 books."
"Daisy bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes. 

First, we need to find the weight of the sweet potatoes, which is 2 times the weight of the potatoes. The potatoes weighed 5 pounds, so the sweet potatoes weighed:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, the carrots weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we first need to determine the total monthly cost each person pays and then divide that by 4 to find the weekly cost.

1. Calculate Madeline's monthly cost:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   - Total cost = $400
   - Madeline's monthly cost = 60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240

2. Calculate Keenan's monthly cost:
   - Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
   - Keenan's monthly cost = Total cost - Madeline's monthly cost = $400 - $240 = $160

3. Calculate Keenan's weekly cost:
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly cost / 4 = $160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is $12.00."
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to determine her hourly rate.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. So, her hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the chickens.
Isaias sells each chicken for $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.
Isaias makes a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Total cost price} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for a total of $7000.

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses Mitchell sold.

The total sold by Julie and the boys is 32, and Julie sold 14, so the boys together sold:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses equally between them:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, let's first determine Melanie's current age.

If in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, then her current age is:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of petals for the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals for the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.
4. The total cost for her goods is $11.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the carrots. We know the total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9. Since the total cost for her goods is $11, the cost of the two carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.

To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by 2: $2 / 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
3. In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
4. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Assuming Tasha was paid the same amount for each lawn mowing, and Joe paid her $6 for his lawn, we can set up the following equation for the total amount earned from mowing lawns:

\[ 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x) = 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x \]

We know that the total amount earned from mowing lawns is part of the $80 she made. Let's denote the amount earned from lemonade sales as \( L \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 54x + L = 80 \]

Since we don't have the exact amount Joe paid for each lawn mowing, we can't determine \( x \) directly. However, we can solve for \( L \) by isolating it in the equation:

\[ L = 80 - 54x \]

To find \( L \), we need to know the value of \( x \). Since the problem doesn't provide the exact number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, we can't determine \( x \) from the given information. But we can still express the answer in terms of \( x \).

However, if we assume that the problem is solvable with the given information, we can infer that the total earnings from mowing lawns must be a multiple of 6 (since Joe paid $6 per mowing). The only way to satisfy the equation \( 54x + L = 80 \) with \( L \) being a positive amount is if \( x \) is such that \( 54x \) is less than 80. The only integer value for \( x \) that works is 1 (since \( 54 \times 2 = 108 \) which is more than 80).

So, if \( x = 1 \):

\[ 54 \times 1 = 54 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

Total distance rowed: 110 miles"
"Susan originally made 100 cookies. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies to be divided among her 6 nephews.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we divide the remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies ÷ 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Each of Susan’s nephews will get 16 cookies."
"Denise read 10 pages yesterday, and today she read 5 more than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.

So, the total number of pages Denise read is 10 (yesterday) + 18 (today) = 28 pages.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and did not read any pages today, so he read a total of 13 pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total number of pages Daniel read from the total number of pages Denise read:

28 (Denise's total) - 13 (Daniel's total) = 15 pages.

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is equivalent to half an adult's bowl (since 8 child bowls = 4 adult bowls, 1 child bowl = 1/2 adult bowl).

Calvin has 2 adult bowls of soup left for the children, and since each child's bowl is equivalent to 1/2 an adult bowl, we can calculate the number of child bowls as follows:

2 adult bowls * 2 (since 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls) = 4 child bowls

Calvin has 2 children, and there are 4 child bowls available. Therefore, each child can have:

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

The total amount William spent is:
$7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

He spent a total of $8.00."
"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \(20 \times 0.5 = 10\) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \(\frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75\) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies.
2. Divide the total amount of money she spent by the total number of tickets she bought.

First, let's calculate the total number of times Deepa saw the movies. There are 9 movies, and she saw each one 3 times:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Next, we know she spent $216 in total. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216 \text{ dollars}}{27 \text{ tickets}} = 8 \text{ dollars per ticket} \]

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8."
"Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

To find out how much free time he has left in his day, we need to calculate the total hours in a day and subtract the time he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog.

There are 24 hours in a day. So, the calculation for his free time is:

24 hours (total in a day) - 10 hours (sleeping) - 8 hours (working) - 1 hour (walking dog) = 5 hours

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes.

He uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes used is:
1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoe boxes.

Therefore, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes.

So, the final answer is:
4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes are left in Tim's box."
"Sarah has 9 books.

"Dean starts with 30 marbles.

First, he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie:
1/5 of 30 = 30 / 5 = 6 marbles

So, after giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
30 - 6 = 24 marbles

Then, he gives 10 marbles to Donald:
24 - 10 = 14 marbles

Therefore, Dean is left with 14 marbles."
"Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old.

Let's denote Adam's age four years ago as \( A \). Therefore, Adam's current age is \( A + 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can write the equation:

\[ 52 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

So, Adam's current age is \( 26 + 4 = 30 \) years old.

In 8 years, Adam will be:

\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years."
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm first:

2 * 200 acres = 400 acres

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount:

400 acres + 100 acres = 500 acres

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

To find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

200 acres + 500 acres = 700 acres

The two farms together have 700 acres."
"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. Therefore, for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8.00 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8.00 = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, determine how long it takes John to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times that long, so:
     \[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Next, calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes, given that he drinks a bottle every half hour.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 180 minutes, there are:
     \[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes him to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total number of pieces of bologna can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Bruce works a total of 23 hours in these three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."

"To calculate the profit and the total money raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that it takes the sloth 4 hours to make one trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 2 trips. We can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of berries per trip} \times 2 \text{ trips} = 24 \text{ berries} \]

Solving for the number of berries per trip:

\[ \text{Number of berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days if it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water that will be used in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the total water used from the initial amount in the tank gives us the remaining water:

\[ \text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."

2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.

On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up the total number of Junebugs removed:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding these together:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 300\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):
\[\frac{300}{5} = 60\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month, then find the revenue from selling those widgets, and finally, find the difference in revenue.

First, let's calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 60
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days in a month
   - Total widgets in a month = 60 × 24 × 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 43,200

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Widgets per hour: 45
   - Hours per day: 24
   - Days in a month: 30
   - Total widgets in a month = Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days in a month
   - Total widgets in a month = 45 × 24 × 30
   - Total widgets in a month = 32,400

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:

1. **Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:**

2. **Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Price per widget: $6
   - Total revenue = Total widgets × Price per widget
   - Total revenue = 32,400 × 6
   - Total revenue = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue:

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400
- Difference in revenue = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour plus additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds.
Three pounds less than that is \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total hay needed for the goats and sheep:

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\)
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\)

Adding these together gives the total hay needed:

\(75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}\)

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so we subtract that amount:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ dollars}}{25 \text{ dollars/pen}} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

20 words * 15 letters/word = 300 letters

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

300 letters + 50 letters = 350 letters

To find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds, we add Craig's total to his brother's total:

300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650."
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children in one row and then multiply that by the total number of rows.

Each row has 8 children, and there are 7 rows per school. Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of rows is:

\[ 7 \text{ rows/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ rows} \]

Now, since each row has 8 children, the total number of children is:

\[ 8 \text{ children/row} \times 35 \text{ rows} = 280 \text{ children} \]

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"First, let's calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice the teacher can get from redeeming all her coupons:

Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, and the teacher has 9 coupons. So, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
\[ 9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles/coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher gives to the students. There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles/student} = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles to find out how many bottles the teacher has for herself:
\[ 900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

So, Patty charged a total of $205 for the job."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, we need to account for the 5 CDs that James doesn't like and sells for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we subtract the money he got from selling the 5 CDs from the total amount he spent:

$90 - $200 = -$110

The negative value indicates that James actually gained money from this transaction, not that he was out money. He was out $90 initially but gained $200 from selling the CDs, so he ended up with a net gain of $110.

Final numerical answer:
$110"
"To calculate how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to multiply the quantity of each type of root crop by its respective price and then sum up the totals.

For the yams:
6 yams * $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes * $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots * $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, we add up the totals:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Calculate the distance James swims.
2. Determine the time it takes to swim that distance.
3. Calculate the rest time.
4. Determine the time it takes to swim the remaining distance at the reduced speed.
5. Sum up all the times to get the total time.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Distance James swims:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Time to swim the distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts to get the total commission:

\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, we substitute these expressions for \( A \) and \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each paper is printed on both sides, one side of a paper corresponds to one page in the book. Therefore, the number of pages in the book can be calculated by multiplying the thickness of the book in inches by the number of pages per inch.

\[ \text{Number of pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Number of pages} = 150 \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into 15-minute intervals. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, we multiply 15 hours by 4:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 4 \text{ intervals/hour} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Now, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval. So, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Actual Sleep Duration:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is the actual time Kim was asleep.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 480 minutes.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
   - Total actual sleep duration: \(480 + 55 = 535\) minutes.

5. **Subtract Sleepwalking Time:**
   - Total sleep duration minus sleepwalking time: \(535 - 23 = 512\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 512 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Number of measuring spoons remaining} \]
\[ \text{Total utensils} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people in attendance and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:

\[ 48 = 1.20 \times x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is \( 7J \) and we know that \( 7J = 7 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

7"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day:** They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day:** They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

Total holes at the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\)

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. So, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

**Final Answer:**

"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got:

\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so Collins got:

\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the amounts received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:

\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:

225"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to the original $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:

\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon."
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so:

Number of episodes = 20 minutes / 2 = 10 episodes

Therefore, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance she flew in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown south is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown north is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she got home, there were 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 48 brownies.

So, the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party is:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is 12 brownies, 1 1/2 dozen is 18 brownies.

The number of brownies left over after the surprise party is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten during the party) = 48 brownies.

Greta had 48 brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So, the cost for the first 2 phones is:
2 phones * $600/phone = $1200

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones."
"Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

The total number of players in both teams combined is 13 + 20 = 33 players."
"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she kept:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then determine how much more money he needs after accounting for the money he has already saved. Finally, we'll calculate the number of hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount.

1. Calculate the total cost of the books:
   - Dictionary: $18
   - Dinosaur book: $13
   - Children's cookbook: $8
   Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

2. Calculate how much more money Tyler needs:
   - Money saved: $14
   - Total cost of books: $39
   Money needed = $39 - $14 = $25

3. Calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
   - Earnings per hour: $5
   - Money needed: $25
   Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, if we add up the cherries that Robert, Richard, and Jerry have, it should equal 60.
4. We know Robert and Richard have 30 and 20 cherries respectively, so together they have \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
5. Therefore, Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Let's break down the sales for each day and then calculate the total earnings.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each day.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total Earnings for Two Days:**
- Total for Saturday + Total for Sunday = $150 + $315 = $465

Sunny earned a total of $465 for the two days."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She will be outside for 4 hours a day, so she will use:

\[ 1 \, \text{ounce/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours/day} = 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \]

Over 8 days, she will use:

\[ 4 \, \text{ounces/day} \times 8 \, \text{days} = 32 \, \text{ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces needed by the ounces per bottle:

\[ \frac{32 \, \text{ounces}}{8 \, \text{ounces/bottle}} = 4 \, \text{bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate the price of the red car:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is:
$160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother.

First, let's determine Emil's age when he turns 24:
Emil's age in 5 years = 19 + 5 = 24

Now, let's denote:
- The current age of Emil's dad as \(D\)
- The current age of Emil's brother as \(B\)

When Emil is 24:
- His dad's age will be \(D + 5\)
- His brother's age will be \(B + 5\)

According to the problem:
1. Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)\]
\[48 = D + 5\]
\[D = 43\]

2. Emil will be twice as old as his brother:
\[24 = 2(B + 5)\]
\[24 = 2B + 10\]
\[14 = 2B\]
\[B = 7\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[D + B = 43 + 7 = 50\]

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50."
"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, which means her friend gave her \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend:

\(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can calculate this as follows:

20% of 30 students = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 students - 6 football players = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate 25% of 24:

25% of 24 students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, which would be:

5 * 5 = 25

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."

"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply it by 5.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket will have 3 petunias, and each petunia costs $3.00.
- Each basket will have 2 sweet potato vines, and each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend:
\[ \$70.00 \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil, so the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is equal to the remaining soil:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Therefore, they can plant 3 roses."
"First, we need to calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with her monthly savings. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

The number of pairs of shoes she can buy each month is:
\[ \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

Since she can only buy whole pairs of shoes, she can buy 0.5 pairs, which means she can buy 0 pairs of shoes each month with her current savings.

Now, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we multiply the number of pairs she can buy each month by the number of months in a year:
\[ 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

However, since she can only buy whole pairs, the actual number of pairs she can buy in a year is 0.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 0 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
2. Then it runs on high for 4 hours, cooling the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
3. After that, it is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.

Now, let's calculate the temperature changes:

1. Cooling on low for 3 hours: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\)
2. Cooling on high for 4 hours: \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\)
3. Warming up for 2 hours: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\)

Now, we sum up the total temperature change:

Total cooling: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\)
Total warming: \(4 \text{ degrees}\)

Net temperature change: \(18 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}\)

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old, we can use this information to find out when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the second time Bill saw the Comet would be 75 years after his dad saw it. So, if Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, Bill saw it 75 years later.

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the Comet. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Since Bill saw the Comet for the second time 75 years after his dad saw it, we can calculate Bill's age when he first saw the Comet by subtracting 75 years from 90 years:

\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To calculate the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check and how often he writes them.

1. Electric bill: 1 check per month
2. Gas bill: 1 check per month
3. Church: 2 checks per month
4. Pest and lawn service: 1 check every quarter (4 checks per year)

Now, let's calculate the total:

- Electric bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Gas bill: 12 checks per year (1 check/month * 12 months)
- Church: 24 checks per year (2 checks/month * 12 months)
- Pest and lawn service: 4 checks per year (1 check/quarter * 4 quarters)

Adding these up:

12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 52 checks per year

Therefore, Buford writes 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.
2. The second plane's 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

Now, let's analyze the first plane's flights:

- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

So, the first plane makes 88 trips in total. Three-quarters of these trips are to Greece, which means:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips to Greece}
\]

This leaves:

\[
88 - 66 = 22 \text{ trips to either France or Germany}
\]

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is:

\[
\frac{22}{2} = 11
\]

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day."
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(120 / 60 = 2\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
2. \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
3. The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
4. Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's find the average age of the group. The average age is given by:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since Helene's age is twice the average age, we have:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4} \]
\[ 4H = 14 + 2H + 2W \]
\[ 2H = 14 + 2W \]
\[ H = 7 + W \]

Now, we use the total age equation:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We already have \( H = 7 + W \), so substituting this into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 7 + W + W = 13 \]
\[ 7 + 2W = 13 \]
\[ 2W = 6 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

So, the age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \)."
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \), so the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100\% = 25\%

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds:
- He has 9 inpatients.
- He spends 20 minutes per inpatient.

Total time for inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- He has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.

Total time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to find the total time spent on these activities:
Total time spent = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes.

Convert the total time spent from minutes to hours:
480 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours.

Finally, subtract the total time spent from the 9 hours available to find the time left for updating records:
9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she needs to finish making it 3 hours before that time. 

5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm."

Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:

- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- There are 10 students.

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ 25 + (1.50 \times 10) = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:

- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- The cost per session is $40.

So, the total cost per day is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:

- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total cost per week is:
\[ 120 \times 4 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:

- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.

So, the total cost per month is:
\[ 480 \times 1 = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - The total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of female porcupines = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \).

2. **Determine the number of male porcupines:**
   - Total population = Number of female porcupines + Number of male porcupines.
   - Number of male porcupines = Total population - Number of female porcupines.
   - Number of male porcupines = 50 - 30 = 20.

3. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   - Number of baby porcupines born each month = Number of female porcupines \(\times\) Babies per female per month.
   - Number of baby porcupines born each month = 30 \(\times\) 4 = 120.

4. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   - Number of baby porcupines born in a year = Number of baby porcupines born each month \(\times\) 12.
   - Number of baby porcupines born in a year = 120 \(\times\) 12 = 1440.

5. **Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year:**
   - Total number of porcupines after a year = Initial population + Number of baby porcupines born in a year.
   - Total number of porcupines after a year = 50 + 1440 = 1490.

**Final numerical answer:**
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the swimming pool. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, to find the cost to fill the pool, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool will be:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To find the total number of sticks, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is 34."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance traveled by Matteo from the distance traveled by Shandy:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we can break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Total number of students**: 3000

2. **Students over 16 years old**: Half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: The remaining students over 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: The other half of the total students
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: One-half of the students under 16 years old
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: The remaining students under 16 years old
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: Sum of female students over 16 and under 16
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps} \]

Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ laps} \]

Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps} \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 55.8%. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for a down payment on a $10,000 car, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. The amount she needs to save is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has bought:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Now, we need to determine how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75. Each plum costs $0.25, so the number of plums he can buy is:

\[ \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound price increase:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \) because she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]

Substituting the values of \( S \) and \( L \):
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is \( x = 6 \), and the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.6 - 0.5 \times 0.8 - 0.6 \times 0.8 + 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.3 - 0.4 - 0.48 + 0.24) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76 \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 76\% \]

"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already accounted for (graduates and faculty).
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: \(950 + 300 = 1250\)
2. Available seats for tickets: \(6000 - 1250 = 4750\)
3. Number of graduates: (not given, so let's assume it's \(G\))
4. Tickets per graduate: \(\frac{4750}{G}\)

Since the number of graduates \(G\) is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume there are 100 graduates (for example), then:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{100} = 47.5
\]

Since you can't give half a ticket, the number of tickets each graduate would receive would be 47, with some tickets left over.

Final numerical answer (assuming 100 graduates):
\[
47

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
2. Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans. So, the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat is \(2 \times 75 = 150\).
3. Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean. Therefore, to find out how many small jelly beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized jelly beans, we multiply 150 by 3.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(150 \times 3 = 450\).

"To determine how many seconds it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.
2. Determine the total time it takes to place all the soda bottles and drop the candy.

First, let's find out how many soda bottles Richard will place. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to place a bottle every 3 feet. This means the number of bottles is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \text{ bottles}
\]

The ""+1"" is because we need to count the bottle at the starting point.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to place all the bottles and drop the candy. Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and there are 8 intervals between 9 bottles, the total time is:

\[
8 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To find out how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the $50 she started with.

First, let's calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
- The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Parmesan cheese is \(2 \times 11 = 22\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese:
- The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
- Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the cost of the Mozzarella cheese is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost of the cheese:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money Amor will have left:
- Amor started with $50.
- She spent $40 on cheese.
- Therefore, the money left is \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
10 dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have earned $25,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount earned if he had continued working = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would earn with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to find out how long it would take for him to earn the equivalent of the total amount borrowed plus the money he would have earned if he had continued working.
   - Total amount to be earned = $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

4. **Calculate the time it would take to earn the total amount:**
   - Annual income with a college degree = $75,000.
   - Time to earn $300,000 = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first find one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
   \[
   \frac{425}{5} = 85
   \]
   Then, we add 17 to this number:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

3. On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. First, we find twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then, we add 5 to this number:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

4. Now, we sum up the deliveries from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

So, Johnny's dad lost on average approximately $7.17 per race that day."

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we first need to calculate their current heights.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the time worked per day to hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - They worked for 3 weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total number of days worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team:**
   - They worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - So, the total hours worked by the team is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, the hours worked by each painter is \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:

\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:

\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many tiles are needed to cover the kitchen floor.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.
- Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
- Each tile costs $12.
- The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles is **$2400**."
"To calculate the annual cost of the insurance after the increase, we first need to find the new monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 to get the yearly cost.

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost:
   - The normal cost is $120 a month.
   - The increase is 60% of $120.
   - 60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72.

2. Add the increase to the normal cost to get the new monthly cost:
   - New monthly cost = $120 + $72 = $192.

3. Calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
   - Annual cost = $192 * 12 = $2,304.

So, James pays $2,304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads for the twin sheets.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load for the king sheet.

So, Greg does 8 + 1 = 9 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous collection) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily food consumption for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \text{ grams/cat/day} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}\).

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's time as:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the 4 tests.
2. Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4).

First, let's calculate the total score:

- John scored 100 on each of his first 3 tests, so for these 3 tests, the total score is \(100 + 100 + 100 = 300\).
- He scored 80 on his 4th test.

So, the total score for all 4 tests is \(300 + 80 = 380\).

Now, to find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests:

\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by both the glee club and the football team, and then subtract these from the total number of pizzas ordered.

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club = 20 * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas.

2. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
   - The football team ate 80% of the pizzas they ordered.
   - Number of pizzas eaten by the football team = 40 * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas.

3. Now, we calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both teams.
   - Total pizzas eaten = 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.

4. The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.

5. Finally, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered to find out how many are left.
   - Pizzas left = 60 - 46 = 14 pizzas.

Final numerical answer:
14"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ \text{Cost of big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ \text{Total cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining.
4. Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.
   - 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches in total.

Now, we need to find out how many meatballs are in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches that remained.

- Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
- 6 sub sandwiches * 4 meatballs per sub sandwich = 24 meatballs.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. 

A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means that 5 trucks could not deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day:
300 tons"
"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he can take advantage of the promotion by buying 3 pounds at the full price and getting 3 pounds at half price.

The cost of butter is $4.00 per pound.

For the first 3 pounds, the cost is:
3 pounds * $4.00/pound = $12.00

For the next 3 pounds (at half price), the cost is:
3 pounds * ($4.00/pound * 0.5) = 3 pounds * $2.00/pound = $6.00

Adding these together, the total cost is:
$12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00

Therefore, it will cost Dennis $18.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter."
"To calculate the total cost of the party, we need to determine the number of guests and then apply the cost structure.

First, let's find out how many guests Kayla actually has:

- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.
- In total, she invited 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41 people.

The cost structure is as follows:
- A flat fee of $125 for the first 20 guests.
- An additional $6 for each guest above 20.

So, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21.

The cost for the additional guests is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the flat fee to the cost of the additional guests gives us the total cost:
$125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money they each have left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

The total amount of money they have left together is:

\[
60 + 60 = 120
\]

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since the total number of bananas is enough to feed the monkeys for a week (7 days), we can write:
\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7}\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

250 (from the first puzzle) + 500 (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces.

750 pieces."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 15 roses:**
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the amount of money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny has five 5 dollar bills.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money she has is \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the change Jenny should receive:**
   - The cost of the roses is $30.
   - Jenny has $25.
   - Since she doesn't have enough money to cover the cost, she would need to borrow $5 to make the purchase.
   - After borrowing $5, she would have \( 25 + 5 = 30 \) dollars.
   - The change she should receive is \( 30 - 30 = 0 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the change in quarters:**
   - Since she doesn't receive any change in dollars, she would not receive any quarters either.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"Let's break down the timeline of the trains' arrivals and departures:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
   - Arrival time of the first train: 10 minutes from now.
   - Departure time of the first train: 10 + 20 = 30 minutes from now.

2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes from now.
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Departure time of the second train: 60 + 5 = 65 minutes from now.

3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes from now.
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes from now.

4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes from now.
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul will wait for his train starting from the current time until the fourth train arrives, which is 145 minutes from now.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number required:

200 toothpicks - 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

80 toothpicks / 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers paid is \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   - So, the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for is \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Rogers' friend paid is $1800.

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is 10%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 jellyfish.

5. **Final calculation:**

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H \).

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

We can express these as equations:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence."
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth rate per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."

"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales made is:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the total number of bales picked up is:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up from the number of bales made:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, at the end of the 6-hour day, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Normal periods**: 6 periods a day
2. **Extra classes**: 2 extra classes a day
3. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
4. **Days in a week**: 5 days (Monday to Friday)
5. **Extra learning time**: 1/16 of the weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday

First, calculate the total time spent in classes during the week (Monday to Friday):

- Total classes per day: 6 (normal) + 2 (extra) = 8 classes
- Duration of each class: 40 minutes
- Total time spent in classes per day: 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes
- Total time spent in classes for 5 days: 320 minutes/day * 5 days = 1600 minutes

Next, calculate the total time spent in classes on Saturday and Sunday:

- Total time spent in classes on Saturday and Sunday: 1600 minutes * (1/16) = 100 minutes

Now, add the time spent in classes during the week and the extra learning time on the weekend:

- Total weekly time spent learning: 1600 minutes (weekdays) + 100 minutes (weekend) = 1700 minutes

Finally, convert the total weekly time spent learning from minutes to hours:

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet or approximately 10.67 feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}

"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The Velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
144"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."

- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps
- Billy can help 2 people per hour.
- He works 3 hours a day.
- So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.
- Over 40 days, he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**
Billy helps 240 people."

"To find out how old Jeff is, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age is \(24 - 4 = 20\) years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is \(20 + 10 = 30\) years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each of the slides and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 15 minutes for the first break
- 15 minutes for the second break

Total time per day = 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on breaks and lunch.

After 5 days, the total time spent on breaks and lunch is:
5 days * 1 hour/day = 5 hours

Final answer:
5 hours"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. Together, Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran 52 miles in total.

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - (8 + 28) \]
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Ahito's miles} = 16 \]

Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Let's break down the transactions step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract this from the initial charge: $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
4. She also bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00. The sale price of the towels is: $30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
5. Adding the sale prices of the frying pan and the towels to the remaining balance: $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The new balance on her credit card is $113.00."
"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."
"If Chris is 4 years old, and Ben is two times older than Chris, then Ben is:

\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old} \]

Since Caroline is three times older than Ben, Caroline is:

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \(0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000\).

2. Calculate the total amount of money needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed = \(40,000 \times 20 = 800,000\).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \(0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000\).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - Number of years needed = \(\frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40\).

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts, and then each of those parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

First, we find the length of each of the 4 equal parts:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Next, we take one of these 25 cm parts and divide it into 5 equal parts:
\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, and then subtract the coupon amount.

The cost of the pots is $19.
The cost of the garden soil is $26.
The coupon provides a discount of $7.

So, the total cost before the coupon is:
$19 + $26 = $45

After applying the coupon, the total cost is:
$45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

The average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, which has 30 days, Soledad needs to cover a certain number of miles per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of miles she plans to hike each day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of miles she would cover in 30 days if she walks 250 miles each day:
\[ 250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles} \]

Since her goal is to hike 9,300 miles, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to reach her goal. First, we calculate the difference between her goal and the distance she would cover at her current pace:
\[ 9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to cover the additional 1800 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

Final numerical answer:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \]"

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total.

Peter wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Peter and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students this year, we calculate 20% of 50 and add it to the original number of students.

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students.

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year is:

50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

Final numerical answer:
60"
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the rate at which the light blinks.

Given:
- The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

We need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times.

First, we find the rate of blinking:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we use this rate to find the time it takes for 459 blinks:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum time over 4 hours is 5 hours, but to be more precise, we'll use 9 hours as a clear example of ""over 4 hours longer"").

Now, we add up the time each person took:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we need to calculate the distance of one way trip:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times \frac{70 \, \text{miles}}{1 \, \text{hour}} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives a month when visiting his parents is:
\[ \boxed{560} \]"

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first 4 workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first 4 workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.

3. **Determine the total number of toys produced by the 5 workers:**
   - The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to ship the order, which means the 5 workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total.

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

5. **Calculate the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker produces 180 toys in 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour."
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog:

\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many stickers Seth had initially.

1. Let's say Seth had \( x \) stickers initially.
2. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{x}{2} \) stickers.
3. Luis used half of the stickers he received, so he used \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
4. Luis gave the rest to Kris, which is \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.
5. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. So, Kris had \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
6. Since Kris received \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers from Luis, we can set up the equation: \( \frac{x}{4} = 16 \).

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 16
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
x = 16 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 64

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Therefore, John can make 90 small bags of M&M."
"To find out how many days it will take for Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take for him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"To find out how fast the fastest car can go, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
2. Use that to find the speed of the fastest car.

First, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate the speed of the fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So we can write:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know that Arnold painted 13 eggs. We need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be put into a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \, \text{crayons} \times 1 \, \text{ounce/crayon} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \, \text{boxes} \times 8 \, \text{ounces/box} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \, \text{ounces} + 200 \, \text{ounces} = 400 \, \text{ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \, \text{ounces}}{16 \, \text{ounces/pound}} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and that this distance is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Time on the beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, we get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
50 minutes"
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save to reach her goal, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the amount she needs by the amount she saves per week:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60."

\(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that would allow Donny to drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug of water as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the resulting mixture will be able to be drunk if its temperature is at least 40 degrees.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as a weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs of water. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{4 + 1}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the mixture.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over the three-week period and then add these to the initial numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added by Milkie Cows Limited over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of chickens added by Broilers Limited over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Now, we add the initial number of cows and chickens to the number of cows and chickens added over the three weeks:
\[ \text{Total cows} = 50 \text{ (initial)} + 420 \text{ (added)} = 470 \text{ cows} \]
\[ \text{Total chickens} = 20 \text{ (initial)} + 210 \text{ (added)} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[ \text{Total animals} = 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]"
"To find the cost of each single bagel after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Each pack of bagels costs $10.00.
   - Russell orders 4 packs.
   - Total cost before discount = 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 10%.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 * $40.00 = $4.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

4. **Calculate the total number of bagels:**
   - Each pack contains 9 bagels.
   - Total number of bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

5. **Calculate the cost per bagel:**
   - Cost per bagel = Total cost after discount / Total number of bagels = $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

**Final Answer:**
The cost of each single bagel is $1.00."
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - Since 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops.
   - The ratio of potatoes to scoops is \(3:2\), so for 18 scoops, we can calculate the number of potatoes as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of potatoes} = \left(\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}}\right) \times 18 \text{ scoops} = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to get the total number of eggs:
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need:
240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: Jess can see that there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9."

"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of men and women on the bus initially, and then account for the 20 women who alight at the next stop.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men = \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women = \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. We know that he earns $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets per day. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers and costs $8.

Let's denote the number of sunflowers sold per day as \( S \) and the number of bouquets sold per day as \( B \).

From the information given:
- The revenue from sunflowers per day is $26.
- The revenue from bouquets per day is $56.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers.

The revenue from sunflowers can be expressed as:
\[ 2S = 26 \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]
So, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.

The revenue from bouquets can be expressed as:
\[ 8B = 56 \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]
So, Faraday sells 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets per day is:
\[ 12B = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the sunflowers sold individually and those sold in bouquets:
\[ S + 12B = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Now, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we multiply the daily sales by 3:
\[ 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[ \boxed{291} \]"
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5:

\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks.

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells. He sells 60% of his inventory, so we calculate 60% of 20:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \]

Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, the revenue is:

\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \]

Adam's revenue from selling the rocks is $84.

To find out how much money Adam loses, we need to subtract his revenue from the amount he initially spent. He spent $100 to buy the rocks, and his revenue is $84, so the loss is:

\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."
"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of days required for each size of picture scene and then sum them up.

1. For large-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized scenes is \( \frac{45}{5} = 9 \) days.

2. For medium-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized scenes is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) days.

3. For small-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for small-sized scenes is \( \frac{49}{7} = 7 \) days.

Therefore, Patricia now has 21 roses."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's calculate the total distance:
- Distance for the first part of the trip: 110 miles
- Distance for the second part of the trip: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time:
- Time for the first part of the trip: 2 hours
- Time for the second part of the trip: 3 hours
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of winning with the second ticket and then find the probability that both tickets are winners.

1. The probability of winning with the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is 3 times 20%, which is 0.60 or 60%.

3. The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities of winning with each ticket, assuming the events are independent.

\[ \text{Probability of both tickets being winners} = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressed as a percentage, this is:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

"Mason eats 4 carrots each on the weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:

4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:

5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots

Adding the carrots he eats on weekdays and weekends gives us the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots a week."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to determine the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we would need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Carla has 8 identical octuplets.
2. 3/4 of them are dressed in purple, and 1/4 in blue.

First, calculate the number of octuplets dressed in each color:
- Purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we know that all the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows. So, calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- Blue-wearers wearing bows: \( 2 \)
- Purple-wearers wearing bows: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

Now, the total number of octuplets wearing bows is:
- Total wearing bows: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \)

We need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:

- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, after selling all his unused land, Abraham will be able to earn $170."

"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) using the second piece of information:
\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Now, we can substitute \( R \) and \( Y \) in terms of \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + (B + 7) = 37 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 6B = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( R \) and \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]
\[ Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters.

Final answer:
20"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

Let's denote the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister as \(x\).

After giving \(x\) dollars to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money. So, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[15 - x = 12\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 15 - 12 = 3\]

So, Rissa gave $3 to her little sister. Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount of money to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3 to his little sister.

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[5 - 3 = 2\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[2\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The mural uses four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
2. There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint.
3. Half the mural is yellow.
4. The mural used 12 pints of paint in all.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half is made up of red, white, and purple paint. Therefore, the amount of paint used for red, white, and purple combined is half of 12 pints, which is 6 pints.

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can divide the 6 pints by 3 to find the amount of each color:

\[ \text{Amount of red paint} = \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

2 pints"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. The dimensions of each bedroom are 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

\[ 3160 \text{ square feet} \]"
"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Monday, so she counts \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so she counts \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs of clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

\(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\)

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than a regular box.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \) pods.
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

4. **Calculate the number of dishwashing cycles you can run with 10 pods:**
   - Since you use 1 pod per cycle, 10 pods will allow you to run 10 cycles.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. Since he has $1200, the number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after Monday and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it gets smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of the chalk on Monday.
   - Therefore, he has 55% of the chalk left.
   - 55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the daily usage and remaining chalk:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day.
   - 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.
   - Each day, the chalk is reduced by 0.55 inches.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to less than 2 inches.
   - The chalk will be less than 2 inches when it is 2 inches or less.
   - The chalk will be 2 inches when it has been reduced by 0.75 inches (2.75 - 2 = 0.75).
   - Since the teacher uses 0.55 inches of chalk each day, we divide 0.75 by 0.55 to find the number of days.
   - 0.75 / 0.55 ≈ 1.3636.

Since the teacher cannot use a piece of chalk that is less than 2 inches, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 full days before it needs to be recycled.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

Now, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist has fixed in total. The dentist has fixed the teeth by both drilling and capping, so the total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist has fixed, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the dentist has fixed 50% of James' teeth.

"First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5

Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date:

Fraction of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5

Gallons of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost per gallon:

Refund amount = 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school gets.

First, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. So, we can find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27000 by dividing $27000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set is 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to find out how many books each school gets. Since the books are distributed equally among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 + 50 - 28 = 34\] bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages to their stock. They also used half a pack, which is:
   \[0.5 \times 50 = 25\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[34 + 100 - 25 = 109\] bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference between our calculated 109 bandages and the given 78 bandages is:

"Let's calculate the amount of root beer remaining after each event:

1. Fred initially made 24 gallons.
2. His children drank 4 gallons, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.
3. His wife spilled 7 gallons, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.
4. His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people.

To find out how much each person got, we divide the remaining root beer by the number of people:

8 gallons / 3 people = 8/3 gallons per person

So, each person got 8/3 gallons of root beer, which is approximately 2.67 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
2.67 gallons"
"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes.
3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish.
4. Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes to get the final answer.

Let's start with step 1:

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   Therefore, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Now, we calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Next, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   Therefore, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

So, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, before any theft or usage, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.
4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors, so now Amy has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors, so she uses \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
6. After using up 3 colors from one makeup set, Amy has \(22 - 3 = 19\) eyeshadow colors left.

Final numerical answer:
19"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor and the height of the second floor. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height of the second floor is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:
\[ \boxed{240} \text{ inches} \]"
"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their shells.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.
4. Subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total to find out how many shells team Gogetters found.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]

2. Subtract the shells found by team Alphas from the total to find the remaining shells.
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]

3. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]

4. Subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total to find the shells found by team Gogetters.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168
   \]

Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Miles for the first three dogs} \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of the value of his house:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. Then, we'll multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram.

The weights of the tunas are:
- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Last tuna: 26 kilograms

Total weight of the tunas = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms

The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50.

Total earnings = Total weight of tunas × Price per kilogram
Total earnings = 128 × 0.50 = $64.00

Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines. She sells them at 11/8 of the price she bought them for. 

The buying price is $72. 

The selling price is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"The dehumidifier's settings remove water as follows:
- Low setting: 1 liter per day
- Medium setting: 2 liters per day (twice as much as the low setting)
- High setting: 4 liters per day (twice as much as the medium setting)

Brian ran the dehumidifier for:
- 3 days on the low setting: \(3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}\)
- 3 days on the medium setting: \(3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}\)
- 5 days on the high setting: \(5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}\)

The total amount of water removed is:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:

- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons:

- They had 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of balloons they threw is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the amount of the second medicine. The problem states that the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine. Since the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 \text{ mL} = 42 \text{ mL}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find the total amount of medicine for one dose. This is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts:
   \[
   14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. Finally, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine for one dose by 8:
   \[
   56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's classes each have a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity. Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is:
\[ \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

The combined capacity of both schools is:
\[ 120 + 30 = 150 \]

The combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He will pay $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, we subtract the amount paid in 11 months from the total amount owed to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:

\[ \text{Amount to be Paid in the Twelfth Month} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month."

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
2. Initially, the bus had 20 people.
3. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[20 + 40 = 60\]
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[40 \times \frac{3}{4} = 30\]
5. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[60 + 30 = 90\]
6. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[90 \times 2 = 180\]
7. The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of remaining spaces on the bus is:
   \[200 - 180 = 20\]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[20\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   The cost of one visit increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the new cost is the original cost plus 150% of the original cost.
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 2 + (1.5 \times 2) = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   So, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is $5.

3. **Number of Visits:**
   Pauline visits the museum three times a year. After 5 years, she continues to visit for 3 more years.
   \[
   \text{Total Visits} = (3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years}) + (3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years}) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2.
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (2 \times 15) + (5 \times 9) = 30 + 45 = 75

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 by 8:
\[ 40 \div 8 = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, and they can work simultaneously, the total time required is the time it takes for one group to complete the escape room, which is 45 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{45 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. 

The total cost for the wooden tables is:
4 tables * $20/table = $80

The total cost for the roof frames is:

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs.
2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, he will need:

\[ \text{Secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. Cost for the remaining minutes:
   - The call is 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes
   - $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"A basic manicure starts at $35 and a pedicure starts at $40. If Karen gets both, she gets a 20% discount. Additionally, she wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. There are 10 nails on each hand, so for both hands, she will have 20 nails.

First, let's calculate the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount:

- The total cost for the manicure and pedicure without discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount is 20% of $75, which is \(0.20 \times 75 = 15\).
- Therefore, the cost after the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the nail art:

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3, and there are 20 nails in total (10 on each hand).
- So, the total cost for nail art is \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

Finally, let's add the cost of the manicure and pedicure with the discount to the cost of the nail art:

- The total cost is $60 (manicure and pedicure with discount) + $60 (nail art) = $120.

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine how many different magazines she subscribes to.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

However, the question asks for the number of magazines, not the total number of issues. We know she has 3 magazines of the first type, 1 of the second type, and 1 of the third type. So, the total number of different magazines she gets every year is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:

80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32

So, the new price in December is $40 + $32 = $72.

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the discounted price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:

50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36

So, the price after the discount in January is $72 - $36 = $36.

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

First, calculate 1/4 of the original amount:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"Walter initially bought 60 apples.

1. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he ate 24 apples.

2. The remaining apples after eating are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples.

4. The remaining apples after giving some to his sister are:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be written as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we can solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[ x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 60\% \]"

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers

Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9

Teachers at school = 79 + 9

Teachers at school = 88

So, 88 teachers were at school that day."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = $6.00\).

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost of pasta} + \text{Cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1 + 3 + 6 = $10.00
     \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so there are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = 10 \times 52 = $520.00
     \]

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Time per classroom = 15 minutes
Number of classrooms = 80

Total time required = 15 minutes/classroom * 80 classrooms = 1200 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to 8 * 60 = 480 minutes per day.
Number of days = 5

Total available time = 480 minutes/day * 5 days = 2400 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

Total time required = 1200 minutes
Total available time = 2400 minutes

Average time spent cleaning per day = 1200 minutes / 5 days = 240 minutes/day

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

Average time spent cleaning per day = 240 minutes
Time available per day = 480 minutes

Percentage of the day spent cleaning = (240 minutes / 480 minutes) * 100% = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

50%"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase = \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs she has in total:
\[ 5 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much she will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find her profit, we subtract the total cost from her total earnings:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

"Skyler has 100 hats in total.

Half of the hats are red, so:
\[ \text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

After removing the red hats, the remaining hats are:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]

3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so:
\[ \text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white, so:
\[ \text{White hats} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. If the bag is $3.00 off, the cost per bag is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

To find the cost per stick in cents, we first calculate the cost per stick in dollars and then convert it to cents.

Cost per stick in dollars = $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick

Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per stick in cents is:

Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 * 100 cents/dollar = 50 cents

Therefore, each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is:

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so:
- Second side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes
- Third side: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes
- Fifth side: \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes

The sixth side is not specified, but since all 6 sides are needed to solve the Rubik's cube, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes

"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. 

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \). Therefore, the main phone costs \( 2x \).

Given that the main phone costs $20, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 20 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10. Since there are four additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the whole phone plan:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"To calculate how much money Derrick makes in June from selling all the doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
2. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in a day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, the total number of doughnuts made in a day is:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
June typically has 30 days. Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June.
Derrick sells each doughnut for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts in June is:

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{New speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days in this period, the total number of people he saw over these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

The total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, we add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total number of popped kernels:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[210\]"

   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, Tim will need 5 cups of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 30 lemons."
"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the kennel house will need in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds.
2. Calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs.

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled west:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled east:
- Speed = 18 mph
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his house. Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)

2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies made.

Total cookies made: 7995
Rainbow cookies: 2595
Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's subtract the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

So, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs is \(4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs}\).

2. Next, calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - So, the total number of screws needed is \(16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

3. Finally, calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.
   - He needs 32 screws.
   - So, the number of screws left over is \(40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\).

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 10 + 20 = 30 eggs."
"Alexandra raises $430.

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises:
\[ 430 + 320 = 750 \]

Sarah raises $300.

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]

To find the total amount of money they all raised, we add the amounts raised by each person:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it took Aaron to run 2 miles. We know that Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes. Therefore, the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile is:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's time per mile is twice that of Aaron's:

\[ \text{Time per mile for Vanessa} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \times 2 = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Total time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Since there are 200 feet of dock, the total amount of line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line. So, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate the weekly earnings, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Number of reservations per night**: 6
2. **Number of meals per reservation**: 2
3. **Cost per meal**: $5
4. **Cost of wine per reservation**: $5
5. **Number of days the restaurant is open per week**: 2

First, calculate the total cost per reservation:
- Cost of meals per reservation: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)
- Cost of wine per reservation: \$5
- Total cost per reservation: \(\$10 + \$5 = \$15\)

Next, calculate the total cost for all reservations on one open day:
- Total cost for one open day: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

Finally, calculate the total cost for the two open days in a week:
- Total cost for two open days: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the restaurant makes \(\$180\) a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00."
"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, then she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

Final numerical answer:
8"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. There are 20 animals in total.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):

\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know there are 15 cows, we can substitute \( K \) back into the first equation to find \( C \):

\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
