"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's find the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we calculate 150% of the purchase price and add it to the purchase price.

150% of $80,000 is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

Adding this to the original purchase price:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is $200,000.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters a week."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken consumes in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know that Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the morning and afternoon feed from the total daily feed requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of 16 glasses, considering that every second glass is 60% of the regular price.

1. The regular price of one glass is $5.
2. The price of every second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- Kylar will buy 8 glasses at the regular price of $5 each.
- Kylar will also buy 8 glasses at the discounted price of $3 each.

The total cost can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = (8 \times 5) + (8 \times 3) \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 40 + 24 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = 64 \]

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

First, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:
Charleston = 4 * Seattle
Charleston = 4 * 20
Charleston = 80

Next, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:
Toulouse = 2 * Charleston
Toulouse = 2 * 80
Toulouse = 160

Now, we add up the sheep from all three cities:
Total sheep = Seattle + Charleston + Toulouse
Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
Total sheep = 260

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 260 sheep together."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 120%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is **140 minutes**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on return trip = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

**Final Answer:**
John is 45 miles from home at the end of those 4 hours."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her hours into regular and overtime hours, then apply the appropriate rates.

1. Regular hours: 40 hours
2. Overtime hours: 45 total hours - 40 regular hours = 5 hours
3. Regular rate: $10 per hour
4. Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour

Now, we calculate the earnings for each part:

- Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings for the week = $400 + $60 = $460

Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
   \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.
3. In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. So, we first calculate 30% of 180:
   \( 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \).
   Then, we subtract this from 180 to find the number of downloads in the third month:
   \( 180 - 54 = 126 \) downloads.

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
366"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5/\text{year}\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:

\[7.5n \geq 90\]

Solving for \(n\):

\[n \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**
12 years"
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners, and we know this is equal to 5.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]

Next, add 2 to both sides:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]

Then, multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2x = 36 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Next, we find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:
   - 20 - 4 = 16 students

3. Then, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:
   - 25% of 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Now, we find out how many students are left for hip-hop dance:
   - 16 - 4 = 12 students

5. Finally, we calculate the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   - (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final profit: $125** (if choosing jewelry) or **$96** (if choosing electronic gadgets). 

Since the question asks for the profit to be maximized, the final profit would be **$125** from the jewelry."

Final answer:
\[ 7 \text{ dozens} \]"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**

   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time Marissa has to hike the remaining distance:**

   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to hike:**

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles}) = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( B - 5 \).

We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which means the second pair of heels costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

Since the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is also equal to \( B - 5 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:

\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) back into the expression for Allen's age:

\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, to find the average of these guesses, we add them together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."

2. Multiply the daily care time by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Daily care time for all dogs
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
- John has 10 dogs.
- So, the total daily care time is \(10 \times 0.5 = 5\) hours.

Step 2: Weekly care time
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total weekly care time is \(5 \times 7 = 35\) hours.

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of his dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we can determine how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels first:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Then, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[ 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. 

The final numerical answer is:
23"
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points that is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 points = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 points + 1 point = 5 points.

To find the total points scored, we add the points from both halves of the game:

Total points = 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling his lego sets.
   - John has 13 lego sets.
   - He sells each lego set for $15.
   - Total money from selling lego sets = 13 * $15 = $195.

2. Next, calculate the total cost of the video games.
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Total cost of video games = 8 * $20 = $160.

3. Now, determine how much money John has left after buying the video games.
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.
   - This means the money he spent on video games plus the money he has left equals the money he got from selling the lego sets.
   - So, $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (left) = $165.

4. Since the money John got from selling the lego sets is $195, and he spent $165 on video games and has $5 left, it means he has no lego sets left to count.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

0

John still has 0 lego sets."
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. So, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours of running.

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours.

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. Let's denote her running speed as \( R \) and her walking speed as \( W \).

Since her skipping speed is half her running speed:
\[ \frac{R}{2} = 3 \]
\[ R = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know that her running speed is 6 miles per hour, and her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed:
\[ W = \frac{R}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. Let's calculate the time spent running and walking:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Speed running} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Speed walking} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

Since Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

Therefore, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old."
"If Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. 

So, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Therefore, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
"First, we calculate the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pie pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

26"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate the grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She purchased a package of Post-it notes (let's call this number \( x \)).
3. At work, she used 220 post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of post-it notes she had:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces are measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.

So, the wire is 4 feet long, which is:
4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained:
48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \text{ per day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$294 \text{ per week} \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"To solve this problem, we need to know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. Let's assume the distance from the starting point to the destination is \(D\) miles.

1. **Outbound Trip:**

"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. If 7.5 pounds of that is from the comic books, then the remaining weight to be removed by toys is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

\(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

"After 20 years of service, Marcy becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year. The base annual pension is $50,000. 

For the first 20 years, she receives the standard $50,000 annually. After 20 years, she gets an additional 5% of $50,000.

5% of $50,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, after 20 years, she will receive an additional $2,500 per year on top of the base $50,000.

Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years of service will be:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Her annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays the full monthly rate of $140 for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than the full monthly rate, which is $140 - (10% of $140) for 6 months.

Let's calculate each part:

1. First half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for first 6 months} = 6 \times \$140 = \$840 \]

2. Second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly rate} = \$140 - (10\% \times \$140) = \$140 - \$14 = \$126 \]
\[ \text{Cost for second 6 months} = 6 \times \$126 = \$756 \]

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year to get the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$840 + \$756 = \$1596 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency based on the information provided.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. We can calculate the miles per gallon as follows:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons of gas used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank of gas:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Tank capacity} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Given that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, to find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week.
2. Calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money she makes from teaching those students.

First, let's find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

- She teaches 5 classes every weekday (Monday to Friday), so that's \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes}\).
- On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

So, the total number of classes in a week is \(25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes}\).

Next, we calculate the total number of students she teaches in a week:

- Each class has 15 students, so for 33 classes, the total number of students is \(33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}\).

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money she makes:

- She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students, the total amount of money is \(495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7425.00\).

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7425.00\) in one week."
"The first recipe has 20 instructions.

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

So, the money raised from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 \text{ per brownie} = \$129 \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

So, the money raised from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times \$4 \text{ per slice} = \$92 \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ \$129 + \$92 = \$221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221."
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.
3. Calculate the total amount to be paid including interest.
4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The cost of one cell phone is $150, and Shiela bought five of them.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. A 2% interest is charged for each unit. Since there are five units, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
   \]

3. The total amount to be paid including interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 750 + 15 = 765
   \]

4. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by 3:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
   \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) each month for 3 months."
"First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, we add up the earnings from each type of flower to get the total amount Artie will make:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 365 days and then determine how many 110-cup bags are needed.

First, we know that for the first 180 days, the puppy will consume 1 cup of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the first 180 days is:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to calculate the amount of dog food for the remaining days of the first year. Since there are 365 days in a year, the number of days left after the first 180 days is:
\[ 365 \text{ days} - 180 \text{ days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

For these 185 days, the puppy will consume 2 cups of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food for the remaining 185 days is:
\[ 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add the amounts of dog food consumed in the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food consumed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to determine how many bags are required to provide 550 cups of dog food. We do this by dividing the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the most economical way with the cost of buying them in the less economical way.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

Now, we compare the two costs to find the savings:

- Cost with packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost with packages of 2: $9.00
- Savings: \( 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \)

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{6.00}
\]"
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:

$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters of water. So, the amount of water each girl got is:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got together is:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

The boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water distributed is:

\[ 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

10 liters"

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He receives 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"First, let's calculate Alex's weight. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds. 

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds:

\[ 4 \times 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:

\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each rose bush has 25 roses.
So, the total number of roses is \(3 \times 25 = 75\).

Step 2: Calculate the total number of thorns.
Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add up all the times the alarm rang:

- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total times the alarm rang: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.
2. Apply the 10% increase after five years.
3. Apply the 10% increase for each of the next three years.

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial annual salary.**

Sylvie's monthly salary is $600. Therefore, her initial annual salary is:
\[ 600 \times 12 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Apply the 10% increase after five years.**

After five years, her salary is increased by 10%. The new annual salary after the increase is:
\[ 7200 \times 1.10 = 7920 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Apply the 10% increase for each of the next three years.**

For the first of the next three years, her salary increases by 10%:
\[ 7920 \times 1.10 = 8712 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second year, her salary increases by another 10%:
\[ 8712 \times 1.10 = 9583.20 \text{ dollars} \]

For the third year, her salary increases by another 10%:
\[ 9583.20 \times 1.10 = 10541.52 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can break the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad that the children will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

First, we know that each child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the 5 children:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Then, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the 20 adults:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts for the children and the adults to find the total amount of potato salad needed:
\[ 25 \text{ lbs} + 200 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"Let's denote the time Gerald used to take to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so Lee's time was \( G - 2 \) seconds.

We are given that Lee now runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds. With his improved diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%. To find his new time, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds and subtract it from 40 seconds:
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - (0.10 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we first find the combined number of dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

The number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"First, let's find out how many boys there are:

Fraction of boys = 2/5

Number of boys = 200 * (2/5) = 80

Now, let's find out how many girls there are:

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."

\[
9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes are required to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. We do this by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After the traffic jam, the number of cars that actually drove through the jam is \( x + 20 - 5 \) (since 5 cars did not drive through).

This can be simplified to \( x + 15 \).

Since all the cars that did not take an exit drove through the traffic jam, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 15 = 30 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 30 - 15 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, 15 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. Adding these to her existing plants gives:

\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \]

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:

\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \]

Subtracting the 40 plants she gives away from the total she has:

\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

So, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we add up all the doorbell rings:

- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Third friend: 70 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175\)

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages to be read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days."
"John drinks water with each of his three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) every weekday. He also has a glass of water before bed on weekdays. 

So, on a weekday, he drinks:
- 3 glasses with meals
- 1 glass before bed

That's a total of 4 glasses of water per weekday.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
4 glasses/weekday * 5 weekdays = 20 glasses of water

On weekends, he doesn't have water with dinner, but he still has it with breakfast, lunch, and before bed. So, on each day of the weekend, he drinks:
- 3 glasses with meals
- 1 glass before bed

That's a total of 4 glasses of water per day on the weekend.

There are 2 days in the weekend, so:
4 glasses/day * 2 days = 8 glasses of water

Adding the weekday and weekend totals together:
20 glasses (weekdays) + 8 glasses (weekend) = 28 glasses of water

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and then divide:

\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
420 = 3x

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then its inner volume. After that, we can multiply the inner volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume for all 3 boxes.

Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions of each box will be reduced by 2 inches in each direction (1 inch from each side).

So, the inner dimensions of one box will be:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Inner Volume of one box} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total Inner Volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hour
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

First, we calculate the total hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

- Monday + Tuesday = 1 + 1 = 2 hours
- Thursday = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours
- Friday = 2 hours

Adding these up:

2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV, so the remaining time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:

7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since each episode of the 30-minute show is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday by dividing the remaining time by 0.5:

1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final numerical answer is:
3"
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both Beatrice and Marcell to get the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people, which is 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is:
\[ 45 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows to the shore. We know it took her 64 seconds to reach the shore and that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. We can calculate the total distance she rows by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we know Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore. The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows. We can calculate the total amount of water that enters the boat by setting up a proportion:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore, we have \( 300 = 50D \).
4. Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \).

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

1. **Cost of 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Cost of 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Each board cost $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total cost of all boards:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2x4x10 boards + Cost of 4x4x10 boards
   - Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

1. **Revenue from 2x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $10.
   - She has 10 boards.
   - Revenue from 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. **Revenue from 4x4x10 boards:**
   - Assume she sells each board for the same price she bought it for, which is $16.
   - She has 5 boards.
   - Revenue from 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. **Total revenue from all boards:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from 2x4x10 boards + Revenue from 4x4x10 boards
   - Total revenue = $100 + $80 = $180.

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $0."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the total mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

The number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."

"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles on the first day was:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day:

30 vehicles (total on the second day) - 10 vehicles (from the first day) = 20 vehicles

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40000 = L \times (1 + 0.30) = L \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{400000}{13} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

For the rest of the week (Tuesday to Sunday, excluding the first two days and Monday), she slept 1 hour more than those two days, so she slept:
6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.

There are 3 days left in the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, or Sunday if we consider the week starting from Monday), so she slept:
7 + 7 + 7 = 21 hours for the rest of the week.

Adding all the hours together:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many babies as queens)
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, we can express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):

"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
2. Determine how much he would earn if he worked those hours at his part-time job.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent playing video games in one week.
Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{hours/week} \]

Step 2: Calculate the earnings from working those hours.
Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job.
\[ 14 \, \text{hours/week} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 140 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Therefore, if Jordan spent his video game time working instead, he would earn $140 in one week."
"First, let's identify the food and non-food items:

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

Finally, we add the total cost of the food items and the non-food items (including tax):
5 dollars (food) + 11 dollars (non-food with tax) = 16 dollars

The final numerical answer is:
16 dollars"
"First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:

- Kim already has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we need to determine the total expenses for the cleaning supplies:

- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is \(2 \times \$2 = \$4\).
- The cost of 1 pack of cloths is \$5.
- Therefore, the total cost per client is \( \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \).

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all 8 clients:

- The total cost for 8 clients is \(8 \times \$9 = \$72\).

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. 

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

- Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
- Profit = \$92 - \$72 = \$20

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is $20."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many times John can harvest within a year.
3. Multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of harvests in a year to get the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Step 1: Pineapples per hectare per harvest
- There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

Step 2: Number of harvests in a year
- John can harvest every 3 months.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Therefore, the number of harvests in a year is \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) harvests.

Step 3: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
- Total pineapples = Pineapples per hectare per harvest × Number of hectares × Number of harvests in a year
- Total pineapples = 100 × 10 × 4
- Total pineapples = 1000 × 4
- Total pineapples = 4000

Therefore, John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year."
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up:

1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half that many bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and did not return in the second 6 hours return to the hive. Since 15 bees returned in the second 6 hours, \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees did not return in the second 6 hours. Therefore, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

So, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 15."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first need to calculate the total cost of the tickets.

The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$12 = \$22 \]

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, it means she gave more than the total cost of the tickets. To find out how much she gave, we add the change to the total cost:

\[ \text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \( D \).

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve's time: \( \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \)
- Tim's time: \( \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
- \( 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \)

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
4 minutes"
"Let's break down the charges:

- For bicycles, each bike has 2 tires. So, 5 bicycles would require inflating 10 tires.
- For tricycles, each tricycle has 3 tires. So, 3 tricycles would require inflating 9 tires.
- For a unicycle, there is 1 tire. So, 1 unicycle would require inflating 1 tire.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tires inflated:

10 (bicycle tires) + 9 (tricycle tires) + 1 (unicycle tire) = 20 tires

Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. So, the total cost in cents is:

20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:

500 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 5 dollars

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys:

10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies:

60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid with:

$10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

So, the change Carl receives is:

$4.00"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries were left.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. So, \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries were left.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons. Now, \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries were left.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, so \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries were stolen. This means \( \frac{1}{3} \times (x - 30) \) fries were left. So, \( \frac{x - 30}{3} \) fries were left.
5. Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, \( \frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5 \).

Now, we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x - 30}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

**Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- 3 classes per day
- Each class is 1 hour long
- Total for these 3 days: \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}\)

**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- 2 classes per day
- Each class is 2 hours long
- Total for these 2 days: \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}\)

**Total weekly hours:**
- \(9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}\)

"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to first determine the monthly consumption of bananas by all the apes and then multiply that by 2.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

For 2 months, the total number of bananas needed is:

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once on a 100-yard field, which is 200 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, which is 80 yards per trip. So, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 200 + 34 \times 80 = 200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2920 yards. The difference is:
\[ 3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 80 yards farther than the loser."

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fish caught by each:

- Anakin's total: \(10 + 6 + 3 = 19\) fish.
- Locsin's total: \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\) fish.

Adding the totals together:

- Combined total: \(19 + 13 = 32\) fish.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

First, let's determine how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So, the price will increase 18 times over 36 months.

The original price of the bag of marbles is $20. Each time the price increases, it increases by 20% of the original price. A 20% increase can be represented as multiplying by 1.20 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.20 in decimal form).

The formula to calculate the price after \( n \) increases is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1.20)^n \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):

\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the final price is:

\[ \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32."

\[ \text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of red cars} \times \text{Cost of one red car}) + (\text{Number of action figures} \times \text{Cost of one action figure}) + \text{Cost of doll} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = (5 \times 4) + (3 \times 5) + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 50 \]

The total worth of all the toys is:

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

"To calculate how much Jessica pays in a year if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts, we first need to determine the increased monthly payment for each debt.

1. **Student Loans:**
   - Minimum payment: $300/month
   - 50% more: $300 * 1.5 = $450/month

2. **Credit Card:**
   - Minimum payment: $200/month
   - 50% more: $200 * 1.5 = $300/month

3. **Mortgage:**
   - Minimum payment: $500/month
   - 50% more: $500 * 1.5 = $750/month

Next, we add these increased monthly payments to find the total monthly payment:

- Total monthly payment: $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500/month

To find the total annual payment, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

- Total annual payment: $1500 * 12 = $18,000

Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year."
"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the peeling time is \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, the cutting time is \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert the cutting time from seconds to minutes:
- \(300\) seconds is \(300 \div 60 = 5\) minutes.

2. Subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team from the total number of Chinese participants to find the number of girls.

First, we know the total number of Asians is 240, and 80 of them are Japanese. Therefore, the number of Chinese participants is:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Next, we know that 60 of the Chinese participants are boys. So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Giving money to his daughter and wife**:
   - Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars.
   - Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have \(\boxed{350}\) dollars."
"Given:
- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.

First, let's find out how many crabs Monic has:
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4
Monic's crabs = 36

Next, let's find out how many crabs Rani has:
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10
Rani's crabs = 46

Now, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46
Total crabs = 122

The total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the amounts from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks."

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations, and Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can denote the number of red roses as \( R \).

From the information given:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was \(30 - 2 = 28\).

Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

So, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

### Final Answer

They both picked 30 apples."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
4. A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the hamsters and the rabbits:

- For the hamsters: \(10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces}\)
- For the rabbits: \(20 \text{ pieces}\)

So, the total pieces of straw used for the hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces}\).

Since the total straw distributed is 160 pieces, the straw used for the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90 \text{ pieces}\).

Now, we know that each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and there are 3 cages with equal numbers of rats. Let's denote the number of rats in each cage as \(r\). Therefore, the total number of rats is \(3r\), and the total straw used for the rats is \(3r \times 6 = 18r\).

We know that \(18r = 90\), so we can solve for \(r\):

\[18r = 90\]
\[r = \frac{90}{18}\]
\[r = 5\]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To calculate the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to apply the monthly interest rate of 2% to the initial amount of $100 for each of the 3 months.

Let's break it down month by month:

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the month: $100 * 2% = $100 * 0.02 = $2
- Total amount after 1 month: $100 + $2 = $102

**Month 2:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $102
- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) dollars.

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is then \( 30 - 22 = 8 \) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as \( 8x = 400 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

First, the total weekly need for the flock is:
\[ 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, to find the daily need, we divide the total weekly need by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.

2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.

3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

5. **Final number of trees**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the final number of trees Tom has left is **91**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Friday Morning:** Sue's front yard has 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Saturday Morning:** The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6, so they took back 6 pink flamingos. This leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos. They then painted these 6 pink flamingos white and put them back out. So now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Sunday Morning:** The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. This means Sue's front yard now has 12 pink flamingos + 18 pink flamingos = 30 pink flamingos, and 6 white flamingos.

4. **At Noon on Sunday:** We need to find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. There are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos, so the difference is 30 - 6 = 24.

"To find the cost of 8 pens, we first need to determine the cost of one pen.

Given:
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

Now, to find the cost of 8 pens:
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider that she can remove her lowest score from the five tests before calculating the average. Let's first identify her lowest score among the first five tests:

- 89
- 71
- 92
- 100
- 86

The lowest score is 71. We will remove this score and calculate the average of the remaining four scores plus the sixth test score, aiming for an average of 93.

Let's denote the score on the sixth test as \( x \).

The sum of the four highest scores (89, 92, 100, 86) is:
\[ 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \]

Including the sixth test score \( x \), the sum of the five scores (after removing the lowest) is:
\[ 367 + x \]

To achieve an average of 93 over the five tests, the equation is:
\[ \frac{367 + x}{5} = 93 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 367 + x = 93 \times 5 \]
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
\[ x = 465 - 367 \]
\[ x = 98 \]

So, Brinley needs to score 98 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total kilometers Micheal did is:
\[ 860 \text{ km} \]"
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one dozen cups be \( C \).
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 20C \).

3. **Relationship between the cost of cups and plates:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - This can be written as: \( 20C = 6000 - 1200 \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - \( 20C = 4800 \)
   - \( C = \frac{4800}{20} \)
   - \( C = 240 \)

So, the cost of one dozen cups is $240.

5. **Total cost of buying each cup:**
   - Since one dozen cups cost $240, the cost of one cup is \( \frac{240}{12} \).

6. **Final calculation:**
   - \( \frac{240}{12} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn, and how much she already has saved.

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \( x \). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.
Sara already has $10 saved.

The total amount of money Sara will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70, so we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Final numerical answer:
4"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park."
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to purchase.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00 and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, the total cost of the shoes and the belt is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00. Her part-time job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find the number of hours, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount borrowed.

10% of $2000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months at $165 per month:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

In total, there are 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers in the vase."
"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

The average age of the three in three years is 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate the points scored by Yuri and Brianna:

- Yuri's points: \( \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \)
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

- Total points: 251
- Points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: \( 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \)

So, Jojo's points are:

- Jojo's points: \( 251 - 197 = 54 \)

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank, so the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the cost for each of them separately and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for Carlos:
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Carlos is \(30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Benji:
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- Therefore, the cost for Benji is \(18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
- Total cost = \(90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
180 dollars."
"The trip from New Jersey to Rochester by bus takes 6 days. 

The trip by car takes half as many days as by bus, so it takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

"First, let's determine the new total number of each type of card after the changes:

- Fire type: 30 (unchanged)
- Grass type: 20 (initial) + 14 (bought) = 34
- Water type: 40 (initial) - 8 (lost) = 32

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards James has after these changes:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ cards} \]

Next, we calculate the probability of picking a water type card:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.3333\ldots \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[ 33 \]

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 33\% \]"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces per minute.

Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute.

Her mom places half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom places \(4 / 2 = 2\) pieces per minute.

Together, they place \(4 + 2 = 6\) pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces. To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute:

\[
\frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time it takes them to complete the puzzle is:

\[
\frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84

4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Total cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - The registration fee per car is $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total cost = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects:

"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. Each time he uses 5 empty pens, he can get 1 new pen by mixing the ink.

Let's calculate how many new pens he can make from the initial 25 pens:

- He uses 5 pens to make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new pens.

Now, he has used 25 pens and made 5 new pens, so he has a total of \( 25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \) pens left.

Next, he can use these 5 pens to make 1 more new pen.

Now, he has used 5 pens and made 1 new pen, so he has a total of \( 5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \) pen left.

Since he can't make a new pen with just 1 pen, the process stops here.

So, the total number of pens he ends up with is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made from the first batch, plus the 1 new pen he made from the second batch:

\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends 10 pages a week.
3. Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 10 pages in response to each pen pal, making it 10 pages per pen pal per week.
4. Since he has 3 pen pals, he writes a total of \(3 \times 10 = 30\) pages a week.
5. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends \(30 \times 6 = 180\) minutes a week.
6. To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Griffin now has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. So, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. Griffin now has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[

3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- She works for 6 hours each day.
- Therefore, the daily cost is \(250 \times 6 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the weekly cost is \(1500 \times 4 = 6000\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of work:

- The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
- Therefore, the total cost before the discount is \(6000 \times 5 = 30000\) dollars.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- The discount is 10% of the total cost.
- Therefore, the discount amount is \(30000 \times 0.10 = 3000\) dollars.
- The final amount Jean paid is \(30000 - 3000 = 27000\) dollars.

So, Jean paid a total of **$27,000**."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total cost of the party supplies.

The total cost is the sum of the costs for the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags:

- Cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, so the cost is divided into 3 equal parts.

Cost per person = Total cost / 3 = $96 / 3 = $32

Each person paid $32."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. 

First, calculate the total weight of onions:

The chef spent $300."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

**5600**"
"To find the number of boys in the third class, let's break down the information given and solve step by step.

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so there are \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) boys and \(30\) girls in total.
4. The first class has 15 girls, so it has \(20 - 15 = 5\) boys.
5. The second class has 12 girls, so it has \(20 - 12 = 8\) boys.
6. The total number of boys in the first and second classes is \(5 + 8 = 13\).
7. Since there are 30 boys in total, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17."
"Travis originally had 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps and downloading 18 more, the calculation would be:

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It's also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:
\[ 10 \text{ (wolves)} + 15 \text{ (cougars)} + 36 \text{ (wolves)} + 12 \text{ (cougars)} = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is:

"Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.

Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]
So, Anne went down the slide:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:

\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after the new cows are added. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and 2 more cows are added to each stall, so each stall now has:

\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We are asked to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since each of the 20 stalls now has 22 cows, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{176} \]"

So, Brady has a total of \(45\) dollars in his piggy bank."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:

\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

From point 3, we know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

From point 2, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

"To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = \$17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fee} = 12\% \text{ of } \$350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = \$42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Selling price} + \text{Brokerage fee} + \text{Transfer fee} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = \$409,500

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm the oil.
   - Time to warm the oil is 28 minutes.

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Finally, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:

\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800, so the number of stitches used for the two sleeves is:

\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches per sleeve is:

\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (solo song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

The final numerical answer is:
40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]

"First, let's determine the number of spots on a mamba. Since a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total number of spots for the cobras and the mambas to find the combined total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we find half of the combined total number of spots:

- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

2. **Subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - The length occupied by the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.
   - Therefore, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

3. **Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) inch long.
   - Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads is \(\frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68\).

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

**Final Answer:**
68"
"In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. 

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the number of stories from both weeks:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Ann's brother is currently twice her age. Since Ann is 9 years old, her brother is:

"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents.

Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

1 quarter = 25 cents
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents

1 dime = 10 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Total amount of money Kelly has = 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we subtract that from her total:

145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left."
"To find the number of 5-star rows on the flag, let's first calculate the total number of stars accounted for by the 8-star and 6-star rows.

There are three rows of 8 stars, so that's:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ stars} \]

And there are two rows of 6 stars, so that's:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ stars} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 8-star and 6-star rows:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ stars} \]

The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows is:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars} \]

Since each row of 5-star rows contains 5 stars, the number of 5-star rows is:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones and then divide that by the weight capacity of one truck.

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Determine how many trucks are needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of one truck:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks}
   \]

Since the result is a whole number, no additional trucks are needed for partial loads. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

3 trucks"
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance."
"First, let's determine how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, Izzy has:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Now, let's find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

According to the problem, the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times 39 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of medals given out:

\[ 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

So, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

8 packets * 5 bars/packet = 40 bars

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get:

4 adults * 6 bars/adult = 24 bars

Now, we subtract the number of bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many are left for the children:

40 bars - 24 bars = 16 bars

There are 8 children, so we divide the remaining bars equally among them:

16 bars / 8 children = 2 bars/child

Each child will get 2 chocolate bars."
"To calculate how much money Susan earns, let's first determine the total time she works.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she pauses for half an hour, so the actual working time is:

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Now, convert 2.5 hours into minutes:

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. So, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

Since she earns $5 for each interval, her total earnings are:

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task."
"Let's break down the points for each player after the first three rounds and then add the extra points for the fourth round.

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's add the extra points for the fourth round. A player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Mike's total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point. Jim's total remains 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point. Tony's total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's sum up the total points for all three players after the fourth round:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Total points = \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\)

The final numerical answer is:

On the second day, he does:
- 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's calculate the total for each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Total squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

The total count of activities he's done in the two days is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the household, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members in the household, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner. So, the total amount of rice consumed per meal is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Step 2: To find out how much rice is consumed per week, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Step 3: Now, we need to determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's calculate the total number of crates sold:

- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:

120 (target) - 65 (sold) = 55 crates

So, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
3. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, so she makes 3 bids.

Let's calculate each of Carmen's bids:

- First bid: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bid: $250 + $50 = $300
- Third bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we sum up all the bids Carmen made:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these together:

\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

So, the desk costs Carmen $1100."
"To calculate the total cost John pays for the driving service in a year, we need to break down the costs into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John's work is 30 miles away, so he drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - He drives 300 miles per week and works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - He is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven in a year is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - He gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus for the year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the total bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **$31,800**."
"To find out how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.
On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.

So, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday combined is:
16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to multiply the total by 2:
39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

78 minutes"
"To create a 32-page tabloid, you would need 16 pieces of paper. 

Here's the reasoning:

- Each sheet of paper, when folded in half, can print 4 pages: the left back, the left front, the right front, and the right back.
- For a 32-page tabloid, you would need 32 pages / 4 pages per sheet = 8 sheets of paper.

However, since each sheet of paper is folded in half, you only need half the number of sheets to get the full number of pages. Therefore, 8 sheets of paper become 8 / 2 = 16 pieces of paper. 

Final numerical answer:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold is the sum of the books sold in the first, second, and third years, which is \(90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\).

From this, we can find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[90 + \text{second year sales} + 45 = 200\]
\[135 + \text{second year sales} = 200\]
\[\text{second year sales} = 200 - 135 = 65\]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money she earned in the second year is:
\[65 \times 20 = 1300\]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $1300."
"Watson works 10 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. 

To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

"First, let's calculate how many loaves are sold in the morning:

Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This means that the remaining loaves are:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Half of what is left (the remaining 20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy will lose 2 pounds in 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks), we can set up the following:

If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, then to lose 8 pounds, we can use the proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ weeks}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} \times 4 \text{ weeks}}{2 \text{ pounds}} = 16 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the person will grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

1. **Growth of Extra Arms:**
   - An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra arms grown is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

2. **Growth of Extra Legs:**
   - An extra leg is grown every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, the number of extra legs grown is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - The total number of new limbs is the sum of the extra arms and extra legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs."
"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of business suits:**

"First, let's break down the daily egg consumption:

- Three people eat 3 eggs each, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Adding these together, the family consumes \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs per day.

To find out how many eggs the family consumes in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\(13 \times 7 = 91\)

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week."
"If Quinn is 30 years old, and Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, then Jane is:

"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

\[ \text{Current population} = 2 \times 60000 = 120000 \]

So, the population of Chile now is 120000."
"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Now, we need to find out how many people had previous commitments. It's given that 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments:

\(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people

So, the total number of people who didn't come to the party is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up for the party, we subtract the number of people who didn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"To calculate the cost to fill the pool, we first need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep, so the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
\[ V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = V \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{\$/cubic foot} \]
\[ C = 12 \, \text{\$} \]

   \[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must be women (10 - 3 = 7).

Therefore, the number of women who stayed at the party is the original number of women minus the number of women who left. Since 7 women left, the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

Final numerical answer:
8

So, 8 women are left at the party."
"The magazine costs half as much as a book, and the book costs $4. So, the magazine costs:

\[ 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The pen costs $1."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils.
2. We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of pencils in the three boxes is \( 3x \).
3. Adding the 2 loose pencils, the total number of pencils Jam has is \( 3x + 2 \).
4. We know that the total number of pencils Jam has is 26, so we can set up the equation: \( 3x + 2 = 26 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
3x + 2 = 26
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
3x = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 8
\]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

- Jam has 26 pencils.
- Meg has 46 pencils.

Adding these together:

\[
26 + 46 = 72
\]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[
\frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon adds to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate how much the coffee is weakened by both the ice cubes and the added cream.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can calculate the number of ice cubes as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we need to determine how much the coffee is weakened by these 5 ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so:

\[ \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee. So, the total weakening is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[ \text{Total weakening} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the given scenario.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

Since each new record requires 2 old records, for 7 new records, the total number of old records given up is:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.
   - Total number of employees = 100.
   - Number of junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \).

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - Total number of employees = 100.
   - Number of junior programmers = 40.
   - Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Total payment for junior programmers = 40 \(\times\) $2000 = $80,000.

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
   - Monthly payment for each senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400.
   - Total payment for senior programmers = 60 \(\times\) $2400 = $144,000.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:**
   - Total payment for junior programmers = $80,000.
   - Total payment for senior programmers = $144,000.
   - Total payment for all programmers = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

**Final Answer:**
The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224,000."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We are given that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14

"First, let's calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80, which means they earned $1 for every $20 spent. 

\[ \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

These rewards can be used on the current shopping trip. The customer spent $43 on this trip and applied the rewards. However, there's a coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon takes \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars off the price.

The total amount the customer would pay without the coupon and rewards is $43. After applying the rewards, the price would be:

\[ 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's calculate the net pay for both jobs.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"First, let's calculate the value of the shares after the first year when the stock price increases by 50%.

The initial cost per share is $8. A 50% increase means the new price per share is:
\[ 8 + (0.50 \times 8) = 8 + 4 = 12 \]

So, after the first year, each share is worth $12. Maria has 8 shares, so the total value of her shares is:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

Next, in the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%. A 25% decrease means the new price per share is:
\[ 12 - (0.25 \times 12) = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

So, after the second year, each share is worth $9. The total value of Maria's 8 shares is:
\[ 8 \times 9 = 72 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students.

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 60, so \( C + H = 60 \).
2. Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so \( H = 2C \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first to find the number of cows:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

The total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, first we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Now, the height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ 2 \times 17 \text{ feet} = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"Let's break down the expenses and the final amount step by step.

1. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
   So, he spent $12 on toy cars.

2. Dean also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each:
   \[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
   So, he spent $5 on teddy bears.

3. Total amount spent:
   \[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]
   Dean spent $17 in total.

4. Dean's mother initially gave him $28, and then gave him an extra $10:
   \[ 28 + 10 = 38 \]
   So, Dean had $38 in total.

5. Subtract the total amount spent from the total amount Dean had:
   \[ 38 - 17 = 21 \]

Therefore, Dean has $21 left."
"Let's break down the costs first:

1. One round of mini-golf for Morgan: $5
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for Morgan is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan has a budget of $90. After accounting for her own expenses, the remaining budget for her friends is $90 - $30 = $60.

Each friend will need to cover the cost of one round of mini-golf and one ride on the go-karts, which is $5 + $10 = $15 per friend.

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend: $60 / $15 = 4.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 4 friends.

"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each. 

First, calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

Now, subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money to find out how much she saves each day:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is:
$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

So, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy spent on gumballs:**
   - Each gumball costs $0.05.
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs.
   - Total cost for gumballs = \(40 \times 0.05 = 2\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had before buying gumballs:**
   - Billy spent $2 on gumballs.
   - He had $10 initially.
   - Therefore, the amount of money he had before buying gumballs = \(10 - 2 = 8\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of money Billy had before buying candy:**
   - After buying gumballs, he took half of his remaining money and spent it on gumballs.
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money he had before buying gumballs.
   - He took half of \(x\) and spent it on gumballs, so \( \frac{x}{2} = 2 \).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 4\).

4. **Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on candy:**
   - He had $4 before buying candy.
   - He spent the remaining $6 on candy.
   - Therefore, the amount of money spent on candy = \(10 - 4 = 6\) dollars.

5. **Determine the amount of candy Billy bought:**
   - The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   - The amount of candy he bought = \(\frac{6}{1.5} = 4\) pounds.

"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( S \).

According to the problem, Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Carver is 45 years old, so we can write the equation as:

\[ 45 = 2S - 5 \]

To find \( S \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2S \]
\[ 50 = 2S \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ S = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance traveled:

\[
\frac{18000}{900} = 20
\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of fourth-grade boys at the school.
2. Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

First, we know there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday is:
\[ 53 - 4 = 49 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"

"To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we need to add her scores from the first two tests and then determine how many more points she needs to reach the minimum total of 42 points.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total from first two tests: 15 + 18 = 33 points

To pass, Jane needs at least 42 points in total. So, we subtract the points she already has from the total required:

42 - 33 = 9 points

Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.

The minimum number of points she must score on the third test to pass is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   31 + x = 50
   \]
6. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 50 - 31 = 19

"To calculate the total cost for the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different categories and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames for all seniors:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - Total cost for picture frames = 44 seniors * $20 = $880.

2. **Cost of etching the picture frames:**
   - The etching cost is an additional 20% of the picture frame cost.
   - Additional cost per frame = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4.
   - Total etching cost = 44 seniors * $4 = $176.

3. **Cost of pins for 2 seniors:**
   - Each pin costs $5.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 seniors * $5 = $10.

4. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers.
   - Number of officers = 1/4 * 44 seniors = 11 officers.
   - Each cord costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 officers * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:

- Total cost for picture frames = $880
- Total etching cost = $176
- Total cost for pins = $10
- Total cost for cords = $132

"Let's break down the sales day by day:

- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
- On the last day of the sale (Sunday), they sold half the amount of Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, 6 pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold over the three days:

- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

Total pairs sold = \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of tennis shoes sold is \(50 \times 2 = 100\).

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday, and she got $56 from it.
2. The price per apple is $4.
3. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
4. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.

First, we need to find out how many apples Lucy picked on Monday. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Apples picked on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we know that on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

\[ \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we can find the total number of apples picked over the three days by adding the apples picked each day:

\[ \text{Total apples} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days."

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest rate would be:

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Number of Months}}{12}\right) \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \left(\frac{5}{12}\right) \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]

\[ \text{Interest for 5 months} = 152.085 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay per month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She has 3 pitchers, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, so:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups of lemonade} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \text{ in total revenue} \]

Now, we need to account for the cost of supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the total profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she can sell all 36 cups, we need to determine how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are boys and 50% are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.50 * 52 = 26

The performance is done by the female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform. However, half of the performers can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.50 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost per ride for Dasha is \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- Therefore, the total cost for David is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost for David from the cost for Dasha:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 - 30 = $6 \]

So, David saves $6."

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:
15"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services after the 20% discount for bundling.

The normal cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so without the discount, the total cost for both would be:
\[ $10 + $10 = $20 \]

With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20% of $20:
\[ 20\% \times $20 = 0.20 \times $20 = $4 \]

So, the discounted cost for both Hulu and Disney Plus is:
\[ $20 - $4 = $16 \]

Adding the cost of Netflix, which is $10, the total cost for the streaming services is:
\[ $16 + $10 = $26 \]

Tim's original cable subscription cost $60 per month. By switching to the streaming services, he saves:
\[ $60 - $26 = $34 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ $34 \]"
"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's find the total work time by adding these times together:

Total work time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, so the percentage is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = 0.2 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage spent editing} = 20\% \]

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of slots available in the shelving system. Since the system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in these slots. Let's denote the number of books as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of books \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = 2 \times 36 + 20
   \]

3. Now, we calculate the value of \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92
   \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{92}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.
3. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, which totals \(24 + 5 = 29\) cards.
4. She also received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:

- Initial cards made by Erica: 20
- Cards from her dad: 30
- Total cards before passing out: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Cards passed out: 29
- Cards received: 17

So, the final number of cards Erica has is:
\[50 - 29 + 17 = 38\]

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"First, let's calculate how many slices Jenny gives to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. Since the pizza has 12 slices:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. So:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ 3 \]

3 slices are left."
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can set up the following equation:

Initial amount + (Daily earnings × Number of days) = Cost of the bike

Let's denote the number of days Mark needs to save as \( d \).

So, we have:
\[ 50 + 10d = 300 \]

Now, we solve for \( d \):

\[ 10d = 300 - 50 \]
\[ 10d = 250 \]
\[ d = \frac{250}{10} \]
\[ d = 25 \]

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike.

25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the spiders, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]
3. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:
\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"If Erica is 30 years old, then Beth, who is 5 years younger than Erica, is:

30 - 5 = 25 years old.

Alice, who is 7 years older than Beth, is:

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:

32 - 30 = 2 years.

The difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 2 years."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks a total of:

\[ 2 \text{ glasses} \times 8 \text{ ounces/glass} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, the total calories consumed are:

\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories."
"To calculate the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the daily pay rate.

Step 1: Number of days worked in a month
The builder works for 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ 6 \, \text{days/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 24 \, \text{days/month} \]

Step 2: Number of days worked in a year
There are 12 months in a year.
\[ 24 \, \text{days/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 288 \, \text{days/year} \]

Step 3: Total earnings
The builder gets paid $50 every day.
\[ 288 \, \text{days/year} \times \$50/\text{day} = \$14,400/\text{year} \]

The builder earns \(\$14,400\) in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need to multiply the quantities of each ingredient by 4.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- Number of bags needed: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- Number of bottles needed: 4 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Difference: 6 bags - 2 bottles = 4 more bags of flour

Final numerical answer:
4"
"First, let's calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day.

The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours a day is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
   - Total stripes for these two zebras: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)

2. A zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(36\)

3. Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes:
   - Half of 36 is \(36 / 2 = 18\)
   - Total stripes for this zebra: \(18\)

Now, we add up all the stripes:
- Total stripes: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\)

Next, we count the number of zebras:
- Number of zebras: \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\)

Finally, we calculate the average number of stripes:
- Average number of stripes: \(88 / 4 = 22\)

The average number of stripes on the zebras is 22."
"To serve 20 people, Tyson needs to make enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, he needs to make:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:

- 5 pounds of meat
- 5 pounds of cheese

The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00 \text{ per pound} = \$35.00 \]

The cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, he will spend:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$15.00 \]

Adding the cost of the meat and cheese together, the total cost is:

\[ \$35.00 + \$15.00 = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis in his house.
2. There is twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so now he has \(40 + 60 = 100\) cannolis.
4. He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) corns.
5. Now, he has \(80 + 20 = 100\) corns.

To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we add the number of cannolis and corns together:

\[100 \text{ (cannolis)} + 100 \text{ (corns)} = 200\]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 200."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elliott finished half of his 10,000 steps on his walks to and from school. So, he walked 5,000 steps.
2. He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
3. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

To find out how many steps he had taken before his jog, we add the steps from his walks to and from school and the steps from his short walk with his friend:

5,000 (school steps) + 1,000 (friend walk) = 6,000 steps

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, we can calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog by subtracting the remaining steps from his daily goal:

10,000 (daily goal) - 2,000 (remaining steps) = 8,000 steps

Now, to find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the total steps he had taken before his jog:

8,000 (total steps before jog) - 6,000 (steps before jog) = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

2,000 steps"

1. Calculate the total payment for May.
2. Determine the number of employees remaining after June.
3. Calculate the total payment for June.
4. Sum the payments from May and June.

**Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May.**

- Number of employees in May: 40
- Payment per employee per week: $15 * 40 hours = $600
- Total payment for May: 40 employees * $600/employee = $24,000

**Step 2: Determine the number of employees remaining after June.**

- Number of employees who left in June: 1/4 of 40 = 10
- Number of employees remaining in June: 40 - 10 = 30

**Step 3: Calculate the total payment for June.**

- Payment per employee per week: $600 (same as May)
- Total payment for June: 30 employees * $600/employee = $18,000

**Step 4: Sum the payments from May and June.**

- Total payment for May and June: $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays full price for the first pound and half price for the second pound.

The cost for the first pound of taffy is $3.
The cost for the second pound of taffy is $3 / 2 = $1.50.

So, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashell bag, which is $1.50.

Then, we calculate the cost of the 4 magnets, each costing $0.25. The total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Taffy: $4.50
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1.00

Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Sally started with $10.00. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
$10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has $3.00 left."
"First, let's calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks. It's worth twice the first pack, so:

\[ 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

\[ \$400 + \$800 = \$1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the first and second packs:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$1200 = 0.20 \times \$1200 = \$240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the first and second packs:

\[ \$1200 - \$240 = \$960 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the problem does not provide a direct percentage for candles that will explode. Instead, it states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which implies that 1% of the candles will explode.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%
- We need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific percentage of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we can assume that the defect that makes the candles smell like wet dog is independent of the defect that makes them explode. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle exploding.

\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{100}\right) \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

First, let's calculate the discount price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on a 30% off rack. So, the discount amount per blouse is:

\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

This means each blouse is discounted by $6. Therefore, the price of one discounted blouse is:

\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha picks out 4 blouses. So, the total cost for 4 blouses is:

\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, which we'll call \(x\).

Joanne's total apples are \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples are \(60 + 45 + 0 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump).

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Let's break down the distances Tom traveled each part of his trip:

1. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day:

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
3140 kilometers."
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

**Final answer:** 12 cats were left on the rock."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into the different pricing periods.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings, and the savings from the tattered jeans is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total savings.

So, we can write the following equations based on the savings:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = J - 22 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 28 - T \]

Simplifying these:
\[ 2 = J - 22 \]
\[ 4 = 28 - 28 \]

From the first equation:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

From the second equation, we already know \( T = 28 \), so it's consistent.

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in the original prices is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   - Total capacity of buses = 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   - Total capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   - Total capacity of minivans = 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles to get the total number of employees that can join the day trip.

- Total capacity = 240 (buses) + 180 (minibusses) + 150 (minivans) = 570 employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each. Since the feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, her feeders attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together gives the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day."
"To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
5 + 4 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \) dollars.
- After buying the ticket for $100 and having $50 in spending cash, the remaining money is \( x - 100 \) dollars, which equals $50.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x - 100 = 50 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - The other half (18 guests) were to have 1 hotdog each.

2. **Hotdogs Prepared:**
   - For the 18 guests who were to have 2 hotdogs each: \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - For the 18 guests who were to have 1 hotdog each: \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs prepared: \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

3. **Actual Guests and Consumption:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each guest wanted a second hotdog, meaning each guest would have 2 hotdogs.
   - Total hotdogs needed: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) hotdogs.

4. **Shortage Calculation:**
   - Hotdogs prepared: 54
   - Hotdogs needed: 80
   - Shortage: \(80 - 54 = 26\) hotdogs.

5. **Guests Without Second Hotdog:**
   - Since each of the 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, and there were 26 hotdogs short, 26 guests did not get a second hotdog.

**Final Answer:**
26 guests did not get a second hotdog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora currently has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, let's determine how much gasoline each container holds. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed in gallons. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, she needed:

\[ 3 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he had 1% of his money left, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3.80 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 \text{ dollars} \]

This equation is not needed to find the number of candy bars, but it confirms the initial conditions. Now, let's find out how much money he spent on candy bars:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.80 \text{ dollars} \]

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we need to find out how many candy bars he could buy with 3.80 dollars:
\[ \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{3.80 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} \]

\[ \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{3.80}{0.75} \approx 5.0667 \]

Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 5 candy bars.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends equally.

"Rory's cake weighs 20 ounces and is cut into 8 pieces. If Rory and her mom each have one piece, that's 2 pieces in total.

Each piece would weigh:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ pieces}} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} \]

So, 2 pieces would weigh:
\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have together:

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get:
\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, everyone will get 7 oranges.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. So, he will use:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the cost for the onions will be:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is on sale for $2.00, so the cost for the beef stock will be:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to get the total cost of the ingredients:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, Elizabeth has:

- 1 pack * 20 beads/pack = 20 red beads
- 2 packs * 20 beads/pack = 40 clear beads

So, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Therefore, Margareth has:

- 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 blue beads
- 4 packs * 20 beads/pack = 80 red beads

So, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller total from the larger total:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, for 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. So, for 30 minutes, the temperature decrease is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the current temperature:

"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final answer:
59 minutes"
"First, let's convert the length of Movie C into minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:

\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has:

- She uses 4 dozen eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.
- She also has 2 additional eggs.

So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog she can make. Since each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 5:

\[
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses of eggnog}
\]

Since each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, we divide the total number of glasses by 5 to find out how many trays she can put out:

\[
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays."

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Cost per sneaker:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total revenue from the flash sale:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = \text{Number of sneakers sold at flash sale} \times \text{Price per sneaker at flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Number of sneakers sold to the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} = \text{Total sneakers} - \text{Sneakers sold at flash sale} = 48 - 17 = 31
   \]

4. **Total revenue from the department store:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = \text{Number of sneakers sold to department store} \times \text{Price per sneaker to department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Super ticket for any movie: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda = $21
2. Regular ticket for any movie: $12
3. Regular price of popcorn: \( P \)
4. Regular price of soda: $3
5. You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.

If you didn't buy the super ticket, you would have bought a regular ticket for $12 and then bought a popcorn and a soda at their regular prices. The total cost in this scenario would be:

\[ 12 + P + 3 \]

Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the cost of the regular ticket plus the popcorn and soda should be $2 more than the super ticket:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 21 + 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 15 + P = 23 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = 23 - 15 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"First, let's determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the initial day. The total cost for 20 balloons was $900, so the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

"First, let's calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed. The volume of a raised bed is given by its width, length, and height:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume of soil needed} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet/bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{\$/bag} = 1920 \, \text{\$} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 15 red cards.
2. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   15 \times 0.60 = 9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. The number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[
\text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78
\]

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{78}

"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.

So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Therefore, the remaining number of fairies is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

**Final Answer: 45**"
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.35 \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum these weights to find the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of all the feed:
- Total weight = \(3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490\) pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip to transport the remaining feed).

- Number of trips = \(\lceil \frac{4490}{2250} \rceil = \lceil 2.0044 \rceil = 3\).

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."

"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip, which is 1/5 of the amount she ordered. Since the cost of the pizza is $15, the tip would be:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the cost of the pizza to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Pizza} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in first place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to last place (100th place).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(100 - 2 = 98\). So, she was in 98th place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(98 + 3 = 101\). Again, since she can't be in a spot higher than 100, we adjust this to 100th place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(100 - 1 = 99\). So, she was in 99th place.

Therefore, Finley finished in 99th place."
"First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has:

If each student gets 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky's final cost is:
\[ 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly's final cost after the discount is:
\[ 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar} \]

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances is given by:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

1. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for one horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, one horse eats \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily oats consumption for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total oats consumption for five days:**
   - Over five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**

"To determine the cost per razor after the discount, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is the cost of 1 pack: $4.00.

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon.
   - Subtract the coupon from the cost of 1 pack: $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - She buys 2 packs, so the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after the coupon is $2.00.
   - The total number of razors is 8.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

5. **Convert to Cents:**
   - $0.25 is equivalent to 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor, in cents, after the discount is 25 cents."

Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

The height of the human pyramid will be the height of the shortest cheerleader, since she is at the top and the question does not specify any additional height from the other cheerleaders in the pyramid.

60 inches is the height of the human pyramid.

In feet, 60 inches is 5 feet.

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours each day. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked 200 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

So, in four years, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old.

If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides over 14 days, the cost is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$6/\text{day} = \$84 \]

For the afternoon rides over 14 days, the cost is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$2/\text{day} = \$28 \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together:
\[ \$84 + \$28 = \$112 \]

Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"First, let's calculate the total number of oranges Ashley brought:

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges both brought together:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

To find out how many Greek orange pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges needed for one pie:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( n \).

For the first venue, the total cost \( C_1 \) is the flat fee plus the cost of food:
\[ C_1 = 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost \( C_2 \) is the cost per person for the venue plus the cost of food, which is already included:
\[ C_2 = 25n \]

We want to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, we solve for \( n \):
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the two venues are equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \(D\), by Lily as \(L\), and by Bodhi as \(B\).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \(L + D + B = 43\)
2. \(L = D + 7\)
3. \(D = \frac{1}{2}B\)

First, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(D\) using the third equation:
\[B = 2D\]

Now, we can substitute \(L\) and \(B\) in the first equation with expressions in terms of \(D\):
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know \(D = 9\), we can find \(L\) and \(B\):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \(16\) insects.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each of them used and then add those amounts together.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can calculate the amount of yarn used by each as follows:

Mariah's yarn usage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Grandma's yarn usage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

"Given:
- The chair is 3 feet wide.
- The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
- The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.

First, let's find the width of the rug:
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the length of the couch:
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times \text{Width of the rug} + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. Two of those packs are strawberry.
3. One pack is grape, which cost $2.
4. One pack is green apple, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so it cost $1.
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the weekly pass.

First, let's calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes these trips 5 days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.

So, the total cost of her bus trips without the pass is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$2.20 \text{ per trip} = 10 \times \$2.20 = \$22.00 \]

Now, let's compare this to the cost of the weekly bus pass, which is $20.00.

The amount saved by buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save \(\$2.00\) by buying a weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the farm's count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows and 0 sheep, so the farm has a total of 30 animals.
- The zoo has 20 sheep and 0 cows, so the zoo has a total of 20 animals.

Adding these together, the farm and zoo combined have:

30 (farm animals) + 20 (zoo animals) = 50 animals

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to burn**

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."
"Gerald earns $30 every day and worked for an entire week, which is 7 days. So, his total earnings for the week are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left."
"First, we need to calculate the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we can find the total distance by multiplying the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to determine how much water Hannah needs to drink for the total distance. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can find the total amount of water by multiplying the total distance by the amount of water per kilometer:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Julie starts with $500.
2. She spends 20% of it on clothes. 
   - 20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100.
   - So, she has $500 - $100 = $400 left after buying clothes.

3. Then, she spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
   - 25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100.
   - So, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left after buying CDs.

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."
"To calculate the profit Tara earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags.
Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags.
Each pack cost $4, so the total cost is \(40 \times 4 = \$160\).

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags.
Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is \(40 \times 8 = \$320\).

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, so the profit is \(320 - 160 = \$160\).

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $160 on her bags."

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the total number of quarts they can pick per hour:

- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Total quarts per hour = \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

"First, let's calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption and cost.

Ada's current daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

To find her weekly consumption, we multiply by 7 days:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \, \text{per week} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device.

The new device consumes 2 kWh per hour. So, her total daily consumption will be:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh/hour} + 2 \, \text{kWh/hour} = 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \]

Her new daily consumption in kWh is:
\[ 14 \, \text{kWh/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

At the same rate of $1.50 per kWh, her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528 \, \text{per week} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \$3528 - \$3024 = \$504 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \$504 \]"
"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the number of days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people working together would be 5 times as fast as one person, it would take them 10 days / 5 = 2 days to paint a whole house.

To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

From point 2, we can say that Ophelia has \(C_O - 2\) chairs, where \(C_O\) is the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:
\[C_O - 2 = 20\]
\[C_O = 22\]

So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

From point 3, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, Jenna has:
\[3 \times 22 = 66\] chairs.

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has:
\[66 - 2 = 64\] sofas.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have:
- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas:
\[20 + 64 = 84\]

Total number of chairs:
\[22 + 66 = 88\]

Total number of sofas and chairs:
\[84 + 88 = 172\]

The total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have is 172."
"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \). The total cost equation is:

\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):

\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

Next, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have $48. We need to find out how many CDs he could buy with $48. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $48 by $4:

\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 12 CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

Final numerical answer:
12"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week.
2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week.
3. For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total:

- For the 6 weeks at 4 hours each: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours
- For the 2 weeks at 5 hours each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours
- For the 1 week at 6 hours: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) hours

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

The final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

4. To find out how old Jame's cousin is now, we subtract 8 years from 55: \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

The final numerical answer is:
25"
"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost and the individual costs of the computer and the printer. We can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"The boys brought back 60 shells each. 

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 

So, the girls brought back 60 (the same as the boys) + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 shells each.

Final numerical answer:

"The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we add their thicknesses together:

31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

The total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate how many vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

So, Emma should make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the total bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 dinner bill:
\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:
\[ \text{Total Bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill, but the tip is already included in the total bill, you will pay half of the total bill:
\[ \text{Your Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy starts with $6.
   - He adds $5 to his share: $6 + $5 = $11.
   - He adds another $10 the following day: $11 + $10 = $21.
   - He spends $8: $21 - $8 = $13.

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8: $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is $39."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of days in the first and second halves of the month:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings in the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings in the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

9. **Determine the daily savings in the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month."
"To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought.

1. The cost of the apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
2. The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
3. The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave the seller $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, which totals 6 miles per day. If he works 5 times a week, then the total miles he walks in a week is:

"To determine how many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls, we can use the concept of exponential growth.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 3^2 = 9\) families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 3^3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 3^4 = 81\) families are notified.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, 81 families will be notified.

"To find Mark's initial weight, we need to calculate the total weight he lost and add that to his final weight.

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so the total weight loss is:
\[ 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds} \]

His final weight was 70 pounds, so his initial weight was:
\[ 70 \, \text{pounds} + 30 \, \text{pounds} = 100 \, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we solve the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2

   \[
   x = 398
   \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the notebooks:
   - 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50

2. Calculate the cost of the pens:
   - 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

3. Calculate the cost of the calculator:
   - 1 calculator at $12 each = $12.00

4. Calculate the cost of the geometry set:
   - 1 geometry set at $10 each = $10.00

5. Add up the costs to get the total before the discount:
   - Total = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

6. Apply the 10% discount:
   - Discount amount = 10% of $20.00 = 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

7. Subtract the discount from the total to get the final amount Daniel has to spend:
   - Final amount = $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items he wants to buy."

"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

\[2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles}\]

He expects 70 guests and wants to provide 2 bottles per guest. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles}\]

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

\[140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles}\]

So, Bill needs to buy an additional 92 bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to calculate his weekly earnings first.

"First, let's determine the weights of Susan and Bob based on the information given:

1. Mark weighs 150 pounds.
2. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan's weight is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
3. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob's weight is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Now, we can find the average weight of the three friends by adding their weights together and dividing by 3:

\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}}{3} = \frac{150 + 130 + 260}{3}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground to the pyramid after 10 hours, given that the sun moves 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the tip of the pyramid.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground to the pyramid is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\) upward.

So, the new angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle plus the angle the sun has moved upward:

Therefore, the total cost for the candles is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

James spends $12 on candles."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she read for 15 minutes each night. There are 7 nights in a week, so the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she read in those 105 minutes. We know that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week by multiplying the number of pages she can read in 1 minute by the total number of minutes she read:
\[ \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \times 105 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, we are given that she read a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages read in the first week to the pages read in the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substitute \( S = 44 \) into the equation:
\[ 44 + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ 17 = N + 7 \]

"Let's break down the payments step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy left Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so that's 3 teeth * $1.00 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth. So, for the last two teeth, that's 2 teeth * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00

The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00."

4. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. That's 3 days.

Now, let's calculate how many wooden action figures he can buy:
- He spends $10 each day for 4 days on wooden action figures, so he spends a total of $10 * 4 = $40 on wooden action figures.
- Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he can buy $40 / $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

Next, let's calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy:
- He spends $10 each day for 3 days on plastic action figures, so he spends a total of $10 * 3 = $30 on plastic action figures.
- Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy $30 / $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

Finally, let's add the number of wooden and plastic action figures to find the total:
- Total action figures = 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 23 action figures."

"To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford supplies to the flower shops per week.
2. Determine the number of weeks in a month (assuming an average month has about 4 weeks).
3. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.
4. Find the difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month.

Let's start with step 1:

Ford supplies:
- 20 roses to the first flower shop
- 15 roses to the second flower shop
- 30 roses to the third flower shop

Total roses supplied per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Assuming an average month has 4 weeks, the total number of roses supplied per month is:
65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month

Step 3: Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, in a month (4 weeks), he grows:
40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month

Step 4: The difference between the total number of roses Ford grows in a month and the total number of roses he supplies to the flower shops in a month is:
260 roses needed - 160 roses grown = 100 roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

"To calculate the net profit, we need to determine the total cost and the total revenue, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.

2. **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich
   - Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue per Sandwich:**
   - They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

5. **Net Profit per Sandwich:**
   - Net profit per sandwich = Revenue per sandwich - Total cost per sandwich
   - Net profit per sandwich = $7.00 - $3.30 = $3.70.

6. **Net Profit for 10 Sandwiches:**
   - Since they sell 10 sandwiches, the net profit for 10 sandwiches is 10 * $3.70 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Now, let's add these numbers together to get the total number of birds:

\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average:

\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a value of 20.
2. She adds half of the starting value to it. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20, which gives us 30.
3. She then divides this result by 5. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6.
4. Finally, she multiplies this result by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Now, we multiply 6 by 8, which gives us 48.

The final value of the number train is 48."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

First, let's calculate the percentage error in the temperature setting:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Temperature} - \text{Set Temperature}}{\text{Set Temperature}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 0.04 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage Error} = 4\% \]

Now, we know the oven is 4% too hot. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to set the oven to a temperature that is 4% lower than 520 degrees.

Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ T = 520 \times (1 - 0.04) \]
\[ T = 520 \times 0.96 \]
\[ T = 499.2 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% less than the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000.

First, we calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \times 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Next, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of both houses to find the combined value:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is:
\[ 129,200 \]"
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 (Judy's cups) + 40 (friend's cups) = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 (Judy's dishes) + 44 (friend's dishes) = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 cups + 68 dishes = 120 utensils.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink as follows:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100

Plugging in the numbers:
(1600 / 200) * 100 = 8 * 100 = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

- Total cost on Amazon: $20
- Difference: $21 - $20 = $1

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to grow taller than 20 feet, given that it doubles its height every day and starts at 4 feet tall.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on day \( n \) as \( h(n) \). The height of the beanstalk doubles every day, so we can express the height on day \( n \) as:
\[ h(n) = 4 \times 2^n \]

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( h(n) > 20 \).

Let's calculate the height for each day until it exceeds 20 feet:

- Day 0: \( h(0) = 4 \times 2^0 = 4 \) feet
- Day 1: \( h(1) = 4 \times 2^1 = 8 \) feet
- Day 2: \( h(2) = 4 \times 2^2 = 16 \) feet
- Day 3: \( h(3) = 4 \times 2^3 = 32 \) feet

On day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there's an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees.

Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

- \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees
- \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."

"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- Cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- Birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

\(20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\)

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolates they made together:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
\[ 1800 \text{ pounds} \]"
"Let's break down the spending:

- On Monday, Howard spends $8.
- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

So, Howard has $12 left."
"To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate the earnings from each period separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- He sold lemonade for 4 hours.

Earnings from the first four hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50 \text{ per cup} = 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- He sold lemonade for 2 hours.

Earnings from the next two hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60 \text{ per cup} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60 = \$12 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
\[ \$30 + \$12 = \$42 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and it provides 120 washings:

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24.00}{120} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost per washing to cents:

\[ 0.20 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we need to find the cost per pump. Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \times 20 \text{ cents} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

However, we need to find the cost per single pump, so we divide the total cost by the number of pumps:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{2} = 120 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount on the shirt and shorts.
2. Determine the final price of the shirt and shorts after the discount.
3. Add the final prices to find the total cost.
4. Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount of $50.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Discount Calculation:**
   - The shirt has a 30% discount.
   - The shorts have a 30% discount.

2. **Final Price Calculation:**
   - For the shirt: 
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price of Shirt} = \text{Original Price of Shirt} - (\text{Original Price of Shirt} \times \text{Discount Rate})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price of Shirt} = 25 - (25 \times 0.30) = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50
     \]
   - For the shorts:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price of Shorts} = \text{Original Price of Shorts} - (\text{Original Price of Shorts} \times \text{Discount Rate})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price of Shorts} = 35 - (35 \times 0.30) = 35 - 10.50 = 24.50
     \]

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Discounted Price of Shirt} + \text{Discounted Price of Shorts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00
   \]

4. **Money Left Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money Left} = 50 - 42 = 8
   \]

Therefore, Joe will have \(\boxed{8}\) dollars left after the purchase."
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"Let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Initial Funding for the First 5 Months:**
   - John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Research Duration:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.

3. **Funding for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The first 5 months cost $100,000.
   - For the remaining 45 months, the cost per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000.
   - 50% more than $100,000 is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).

4. **Total Cost for the Remaining 45 Months:**
   - The cost for each of the remaining 45 months is $150,000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the remaining 45 months is \(45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000\).

5. **Total Research Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the initial funding and the cost for the remaining 45 months.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Cost for remaining months
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $6,750,000 = $6,850,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $6,850,000."
"To find the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the ounces of meat each player ate.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this is 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 (first player) + 8 (second player) + 16 (third player) = 20 + 16 = 36 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 36 ounces."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so the total gallons of water used in a year is:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost for water in a year is:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends \(\$312\) on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to add up the costs of all the items she bought.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

Therefore, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day.
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.

Step 1: The total amount of meat in the bull is 750 kg.

Step 2: Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

Therefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"First, let's calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:

Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

Next, we find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators:

Administrators' seats = 1/4 * 72 = 18 seats

Now, we subtract the administrators' seats from the total to find the remaining seats:

Remaining seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

Parents' seats = 1/3 * 54 = 18 seats

Finally, we subtract the parents' seats from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students:

Students' seats = 54 - 18 = 36 seats

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36."
"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights at each intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights on the road is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, the number of functioning street lights is:

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) pieces of gum.
4. After these chews, he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister.

Let's calculate the gum consumption:

- Initial gum: 20 pieces
- Gum chewed at school: 4 pieces
- Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner: 2 pieces
- Total gum chewed: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces

So, the remaining gum before giving any to his sister is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the gum left with Jim is:
\[ 14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left."

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

"On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So for three days, the total is:

10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

On the remaining four days, it pulled four fewer cars than the first three days, which means it pulled:

10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

For the remaining four days, the total is:

6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Adding the totals for the first three days and the last four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:

30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, let's convert Adam's current height from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[ \text{Adam's current height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to reach the required height of 4 feet:

\[ \text{Height difference} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, we can calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference:

\[ \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

The total price for all three jewels is:

"Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together:

16 (snowflake) + 19 (truck) + 10 (rose) = 45 stamps.

Max bought a total of 45 stamps."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob, and then use that to find the time it takes to close the 75-mile gap.

1. Calculate the relative speed:
   - Bob's speed: 55 mph
   - Tom's speed: 70 mph
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. Calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap:
   - Distance to close: 75 miles
   - Relative speed: 15 mph
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be no more than $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10, and remember to reverse the inequality sign:

\[
4 \geq x
\]

This means \( x \leq 4 \). Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Julie's daily customer processing rate:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of customers processed by both in a day:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie processes 100 customers per day.
   - Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of customers processed in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Together, they process \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers per week.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is **1050 customers**."
"Paisley ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles.

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first need to determine the cost of one apple and one orange.

1. **Cost of one apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of one orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

3. **Total cost for 5 apples:**
   - Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. **Total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. **Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:**
   - Adding the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we get \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

So, the volume of the hole is:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig the hole is:

\[ T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole."
"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so \( \frac{7500}{3} = 2500 \) dollars
4. Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats, so \( 2500 - 500 = 2000 \) dollars
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[ 30000 + 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 43500 \]

The total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (0.05 \times \$20,000) = \$20,000 + \$1,000 = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to his new monthly salary:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21,000 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$21,000\right) = \$21,000 + \$10,500 = \$31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with the bonus by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$31,500 \times 12 = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378,000\) in a year."

"To calculate the total time it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to determine the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay separately, and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He has to dig 24 feet of soil.

Time to dig through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, which is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour.
- He has to dig 8 feet of clay.

Time to dig through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Now, we add the two times together to get the total time:
Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental cost: $5000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for a year would be:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Adding the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"Given that it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, we can use this information to find out the cooking times for the other ingredients.

1. The time to cook pork is 20 minutes more than the time to cook rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the time to cook pork is:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"First, let's determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. So, we can calculate Rayna's amount as follows:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we can find the total amount of money they have together by adding their individual amounts:

\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

"To determine how many good days were left in the month, let's break down the information given:

- Christina had a total of 30 days of mood records.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- Her first 8 days were good.
- Her next 8 days were bad.
- Her following 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, let's confirm the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Now, let's account for the specific days mentioned:
- First 8 days were good, so 8 good days are already accounted for.
- Next 3 days are specified as good, neutral, and good, which means 2 more good days.

So, the total number of good days is:
- Initial good days (first 8 days) = 8
- Additional good days (next 3 days) = 2
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since the total number of good days recorded is 12, and we have already accounted for 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
- Good days left = Total good days - Accounted good days = 12 - 10 = 2

"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are also given that Janey has 21 books. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Final answer:
Sally has 9 books."
"First, let's convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow to reach this height, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs doubles. So, the new number of dogs is 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. This means James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since he no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

1. The initial total investment is $1200.

2. Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]

3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720

"To reach their goal of 100 signatures between them, we first need to determine how many signatures they currently have together. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures, so together they have:

20 + 44 = 64 signatures

To find out how many more signatures they need to collect to reach 100, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer."
"Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars per hour.

If Karen works 3 hours per day, she earns \(20 \times 3 = 60\) dollars per day.

In two days, Karen earns \(60 \times 2 = 120\) dollars.

Karen earns $120 in two days."
"To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is 6:36, which simplifies to 1:6 (since both 6 and 36 are divisible by 6).

Now, we want to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. Using the ratio 1:6, we can set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ potato}}{6 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Now, we can solve for \(x\) by cross-multiplying:

\[ 1 \cdot x = 6 \cdot 96 \]

\[ x = 576 \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the 9 people (Jack and 8 other adults) in the elevator.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg, so the total weight of 9 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 9 \, \text{adults} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
4. Katarina has 68 cookies.

From point 1, we can express the number of cookies Max has in terms of Katarina's cookies:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 \]
Since Katarina has 68 cookies:
\[ \text{Max's cookies} = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

From point 2, we can express the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has in terms of Max's cookies:
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 \]
Since Max has 73 cookies:
\[ \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

From point 3, we can express the number of cookies Summer has in terms of Max's cookies:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 \]
Since Max has 73 cookies:
\[ \text{Summer's cookies} = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we can find the total number of cookies they have by adding up the cookies each person has:
\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + \text{Max's cookies} + \text{Cookie Monster's cookies} + \text{Summer's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
298"
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes in total to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes to get to the corner and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 

So, the time they have already spent is:
6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

The total time they have is 30 minutes, so the time they have left to get to school is:
30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Therefore, they have 11 minutes longer to get to school without being late."

Therefore, there are 80 cookies in the box."
"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 4x + 28 = 44 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 16 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the younger triplet is 4 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old."
"First, let's convert the 3 hours before John has to eat dinner into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Now, we'll subtract the total homework time from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has to nap:
180 minutes (total time) - 80 minutes (homework time) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40.

2. Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:
   \[5 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.40 \text{ per lollipop} = \$2.00\]

3. Subtract the cost of the lollipops from the total cost to find the cost of the candies:
   \[\$3.20 - \$2.00 = \$1.20\]

4. Since this is the cost for four candies, we can find the cost of one candy by dividing by 4:
   \[\$1.20 \div 4 = \$0.30\]

5. Now, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. We already know the cost of one lollipop and one candy:
   - Cost of 10 lollipops: \(10 \times \$0.40 = \$4.00\)
   - Cost of 10 candies: \(10 \times \$0.30 = \$3.00\)

6. Add the cost of the lollipops and candies together to get the total cost:
   \[\$4.00 + \$3.00 = \$7.00\]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[
\$7.00

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   - Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong.
   - So, Neil saves \( 20 + \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \) coins per month.
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) coins per month.

2. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong in 10 years:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) months.
   - Therefore, Rong saves \( 20 \times 120 = 2400 \) coins in 10 years.

3. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by Neil in 10 years:**
   - Neil saves 28 coins per month.
   - In 10 years, there are 120 months.
   - Therefore, Neil saves \( 28 \times 120 = 3360 \) coins in 10 years.

4. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in 10 years:**
   - Rong saves 2400 coins.
   - Neil saves 3360 coins.
   - Therefore, the total number of coins saved by both is \( 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \).

"Let's break down the costs first:

1. The cost of the two vaccines is $20 each, so the total for the vaccines is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \(x\).
3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, we can write the equation for the total bill as:
   \[
   40 + x = \frac{x}{0.60}
   \]
   Simplifying the right side, we get:
   \[
   40 + x = \frac{10x}{6} = \frac{5x}{3}
   \]
   To solve for \(x\), we can multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   3(40 + x) = 5x
   \]
   \[
   120 + 3x = 5x
   \]
   \[
   120 = 2x
   \]
   \[
   x = 60
   \]
   So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60.

4. Now, we can find the total bill:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald received 3 parts, so he got 3 * $20 = $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle.

Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

Their goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount they need to raise is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. 

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total water usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
So, the industrial usage is \(40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%\).

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage.
The total water usage by the city is 40%, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the non-industrial usage is:
\[40\% - 32\% = 8\%\]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each item before the discount:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total before the discount:

\(\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00\)

Next, we apply the 10% discount:

\(10\% \text{ of } \$50.00 = 0.10 \times \$50.00 = \$5.00\)

Subtract the discount from the total:

\(\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00\)

"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, let's first calculate how many scoops she can get with her $6.00 under the deal.

The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's find out how many scoops Erin can buy with $6.00:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Since she can buy 4 scoops, we need to figure out how many sets of ""buy 2, get 1 free"" she can get with 4 scoops. Each set consists of 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free).

So, with 4 scoops, she can get 1 full set of ""buy 2, get 1 free"":
\[ 4 \div 3 = 1 \text{ set with 1 scoop remaining} \]

This means she gets 3 scoops from the deal and has 1 scoop left to buy. Therefore, Erin should buy 3 scoops to get the maximum number of scoops under the deal.

Final numerical answer:

"To find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks and then compare the remaining amounts.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, let's find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- So, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each of the five friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. So, the total number of pizza slices is:
   \[5 \times 12 = 60\]

2. Bryce and two of his friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
   \[12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8\]
   Since there are three people (Bryce and two friends) who ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas, the total number of slices they ate is:
   \[3 \times 8 = 24\]

3. The two remaining friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
   \[12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9\]
   Since there are two people who ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas, the total number of slices they ate is:
   \[2 \times 9 = 18\]

4. The total number of slices eaten by all five friends is:
   \[24 + 18 = 42\]

5. The number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 8 feet and 4 inches to inches:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we solve the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 9B = 100 - 10 \]
\[ 9B = 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows.

The number of teachers' cars whose windows are smashed is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \]

Since each of these 24 cars has 2 windows, the total number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars is:
\[ 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the number of windows smashed for the students' cars and the teachers' cars to get the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial 32 ounces.

1. **Giant Cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the total water used for all the cubes:
\[12 + 14 + 4 = 30\] ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial 32 ounces:
\[32 - 30 = 2\] ounces.

So, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"Given that Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven, we can determine that Steven has:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice."
"Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

The cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

The cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

"To calculate how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily savings.
2. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

First, let's find the daily savings:

- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.50 each.
- Now, he buys them for $0.40 each.
- The difference in price per tomato is $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10.

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so the daily savings are:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times $0.10/\text{tomato} = $50/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly savings:
\[ $50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = $350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Sean has 56 marbles, and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can determine the number of marbles Cal has:

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

Now, since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean:

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

To find the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:

Combined marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Combined marbles = 224 + 112
Combined marbles = 336

The final numerical answer is:

"First, we need to determine how many students will be in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally among them. 

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for 12 groups, assuming each group has the same number of students as the initial groups (9 students per group).

\[ \text{Total students for 12 groups} = 12 \times 9 = 108 \]

Since we only have 54 students, we need to find out how many more groups can be formed with the available students. We already have 6 groups, so we need to find out how many more groups of 9 students can be formed from the remaining students.

First, let's see how many students are left after forming the initial 6 groups.

\[ \text{Students used in 6 groups} = 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Since all 54 students are used in the initial 6 groups, there are no students left to form additional groups.

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

"To calculate the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and then sum them up.

1. **Weekday Rentals:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Since 60 chairs are rented each weekday, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.
   - For two 4-week months, the total is \(1200 \times 2 = 2400\) chairs.

2. **Weekend Rentals:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Since 100 chairs are rented each weekend day, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.
   - For two 4-week months, the total is \(800 \times 2 = 1600\) chairs.

   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

3. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers = 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

6. **Total Buttons:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against the regulation. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is:

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{4}{2}x = \frac{7}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[ x = 250 \times \frac{2}{7} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, to find the number of cases needed for the third house, we calculate \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles.

"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent and then find the difference.

For vanilla scents:
- They have 4 vanilla scents available.
- They sell 5 of each vanilla scent.
- Total vanilla scents sold = 5 (since they sell 5 of each and there are 4 types, but the question implies they sell 5 in total, not 5 of each type).

For fruity scents:
- They have 8 fruity scents available.
- They sell 2 of each fruity scent.
- Total fruity scents sold = 2 (since they sell 2 of each and there are 8 types, but the question implies they sell 2 in total, not 2 of each type).

Now, we find the difference in sales:
- Vanilla scents sold: 5
- Fruity scents sold: 2
- Difference: 5 - 2 = 3

So, 3 more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents.

"First, let's calculate the total amount of time Tatiana has for her weekend activities:

Total time = 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours

Next, we know she spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time for soccer and video games is:

Remaining time = Total time - Reading time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Now, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time:

Video game time = 1/3 * Remaining time = 1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours

So, the time she spends playing soccer is the remaining time after accounting for reading and video games:

Soccer time = Remaining time - Video game time = 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of time spent on soccer} = \left( \frac{\text{Soccer time}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage of time spent on soccer} = \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer."

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels used from the total number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
276 wheels"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount, you first find 20% of $1000 and then subtract that from the original price.

20% of $1000 is calculated as:
\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series movies is $6 each, so the total cost for the series movies is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs for all the movies:
\[ 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is \(\boxed{4400}\) dollars."

"Let's define the variables for the scores based on the given information:

- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( A_e \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( E_t \) be the time left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.
- Let \( A_t \) be the time left on the timer when Ava finishes the level.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points from time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ S_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ S_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]

Substituting the values of \( A_e \), \( A_b \), and \( A_t \) in terms of \( E_e \), \( E_b \), and \( E_t \):
\[ S_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ S_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ S_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ S_A - S_E = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ S_A - S_E = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of the four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we calculate the total cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ \text{Total cost of four pizzas} - \text{Total cost of two pizzas} = \text{Total cost of other two pizzas} \]
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of each of the other two pizzas} = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

First, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days:
3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides

Next, calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 2 special days:
2 * 3 rides/day * 2 days = 6 rides

Now, add the number of rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
15 rides + 6 rides = 21 rides

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 21 times a week."
"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). We know that Bob initially had 3 orange and 4 white fish, and after buying more, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Therefore, the total number of fish he bought is 17, so we have:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + O \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + W \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Now we can solve these equations step by step. First, simplify the second equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2:

\[ 2O + 2W = 34 \]

Now subtract the second equation from this result:

\[ (2O + 2W) - (O - 2W) = 34 - 5 \]
\[ 2O + 2W - O + 2W = 29 \]
\[ O + 4W = 29 \]

Now we have:

\[ O + 4W = 29 \]
\[ O + W = 17 \]

Subtract the second equation from the first:

\[ (O + 4W) - (O + W) = 29 - 17 \]
\[ 3W = 12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the first equation:

\[ O + 4 = 17 \]
\[ O = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature drops to 12 degrees during the night, Carson needs to raise the temperature by:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Each log of wood burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide the required temperature increase by the temperature increase per log:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, let's determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the group size:

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups each brought back 2 seashells. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. We calculate this as follows:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

So, 6 groups each brought back 2 seashells. To find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of these groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the first 2 weeks. Since she plays for half an hour every day, and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, we have:

\[ \text{Hours in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 7 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours Kris plays in the following week. Since she plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week, we have:

\[ \text{Hours in 1 week} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 14 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we add the hours from both periods to find the total hours Kris has played so far:

\[ \text{Total hours played} = 7 \, \text{hours} + 14 \, \text{hours} = 21 \, \text{hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = 30 \, \text{hours} - 21 \, \text{hours} = 9 \, \text{hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is then:

\[
\frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressed as a percentage, the overall pass rate is 68%.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{0.68}

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic he can make with the total number of chips.
3. Calculate the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, we multiply:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, we divide the total number of chips by 12:

\[ 144 \text{ chips} \div 12 \text{ chips/square inch} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, we know the mosaic will be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:

\[ 12 \text{ square inches} \div 3 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
   \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
   \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts

Now, we add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups of students:
\(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts

The total amount of tea left after the students drank is 10 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea consumed and the tea left:
\(38 + 10 = 48\) quarts

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
\(\frac{48}{4} = 12\) gallons

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

So, the total number of candies Dale now has is:
100 (initial order) + 100 (additional order) = 200 candies

Dale has already sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
200 (total candies) - 150 (sold candies) = 50 candies

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy."
"Let's break down the problem month by month, starting with the initial number of students.

- **Beginning of January:** 10 students
- **End of January:** The number of students doubles, so \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February:** The number of students doubles again, so \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** The number of students doubles again, so \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** The number of students doubles again, so \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** The number of students doubles again, so \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, to find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide that number by the number of days in a week to find the average per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} \]

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = 420 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} \]

\[ \text{Average branches per day} = 60 \]

So, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower she picked:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
79"
"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of:

\[9 + 9 = 18\]

marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or lost is:

\[18 + 3 = 21\]

Subtracting this from the original 35 marshmallows gives:

\[35 - 21 = 14\]

marshmallows left. Since they want to make S'mores equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:

\[14 \div 2 = 7\]

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
2. Two of his friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes each with 1 quarter.
3. One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so this friend can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.
4. They play for a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.

Now, let's calculate how many quarters each person uses:

- Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. In 240 minutes, he can play \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.
- Each of the two friends who play for 10 minutes per quarter can play \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) quarters each.
- The friend who plays for 30 minutes per quarter can play \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

Now, let's sum up the total number of quarters used:

- Jack: 12 quarters
- First friend: 24 quarters
- Second friend: 24 quarters
- Better friend: 8 quarters

Total quarters used: \( 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \) quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is \( 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \) dollars.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's define the variables for the amounts of each ingredient Tanya uses:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).

From the problem, we know:
1. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt: \( o = 2s \).
2. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest: \( s = 2z \).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ o + z + z + s + s = 10 \]
\[ o + 2z + 2s = 10 \]

Substituting \( o = 2s \) and \( s = 2z \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2s + 2z + 2s = 10 \]
\[ 4s + 2z = 10 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we can substitute \( s \) with \( 2z \):
\[ 4(2z) + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 8z + 2z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find \( s \) and \( o \):
\[ s = 2z = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
\[ o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \( 4 \) ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
- Total cost of goats: $1500
- Total cost of cows: $3000
- Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

63 - 48 = 15

Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Next, Joe sells 20% of his cars:

3. 20% of Joe's cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother:

4. Joe gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars to his mother.

Now, let's calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away:

5. Joe initially had 40 cars.
6. After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars.
7. After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother.

"To find out how much each student raised, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount raised by the students.
2. Divide that amount by the number of students.

First, we know the total amount raised for the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised:

"On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. 

On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

To convert this total time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot. During the first break, 20 more cars entered, making the total:

50 + 20 = 70 cars

When he got out for lunch, half of the cars left the parking lot. So, the number of cars that left is:

70 / 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, the total number of cars left in the parking lot during lunch break is:

70 - 35 = 35 cars

The total number of cars he counted during lunch break is 35."
"To calculate how much John makes in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the number of tasks John does in a day.
2. Calculate the amount he earns in a day.
3. Calculate the amount he earns in a week.

Step 1: Number of tasks per day
John does 30 cycles of work a day, and each cycle has 5 tasks.
So, the number of tasks per day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).

Step 2: Earnings per day
Each task pays $1.20.
So, the earnings per day are \(150 \times 1.20 = 180\) dollars.

Step 3: Earnings per week
John works a full 7-day week.
So, the earnings per week are \(180 \times 7 = 1260\) dollars.

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{1260}\) dollars in a week."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:
\[ \boxed{153} \]"

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00

"To find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week, let's first calculate the production for each of the first three weeks and then determine the remaining production for the fourth week.

1. **First week**: Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
2. **Second week**: Boris produces half as much as the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars.
3. **Third week**: Boris produces three times as much as the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars.

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Therefore, the production for the fourth week is the remaining amount after the first three weeks:

So, the production for the fourth week is 14,000 bars of chocolate."
"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Time spent recording videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, each 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Monthly writing time = 2 hours/week * 4 weeks = 8 hours.

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, let's convert all the times to the same unit for easier addition. We'll use minutes for all calculations.

- Monthly recording time: 288 minutes
- Monthly writing time: 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes
- Monthly makeup time: 360 minutes

Total time spent on TikTok in a month:

"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of one kangaroo be \( v \) (in distance per hour).
   - Since three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54v \text{ (distance units)}
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of the turtles:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway:**
   - The total distance \( D \) is still \( 54v \).
   - The combined speed of four turtles is \( 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \).
   - The time \( t \) it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway is given by:
     \[
     t = \frac{D}{\text{combined speed}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week and her mom gives her $80, so the total amount she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.
4. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she still needs from the total amount she has:

$230 (total amount from job and mom) - $50 (amount still needed) = $180.

So, Erika has $180 in her purse.

**Erika has $180 in her purse.**"
"First, let's calculate the total number of apple slices Adam gets from slicing the apples.

From 3 large apples, he gets:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

From 5 small apples, he gets:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

So, the total number of slices from all the apples is:
15 slices (from large apples) + 15 slices (from small apples) = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, the final number of apple slices left is:
15"
"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that remains in each of the three partially used glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 8 of them perform well in English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 8 (students good at English only) = 12 students good at both math and English.

Now, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both subjects to find the total number of students good at math:

5 (students good at math only) + 12 (students good at both) = 17 students.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration minus the intermission time.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for groups to perform is:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the available performance time by the time each group needs:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to understand the interest rate and how it applies to the principal amount.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since the original amount is $300, the interest rate per year is:

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \]

However, an interest rate of 225% per year is not typical for simple interest calculations, as it would imply an unrealistic scenario. Typically, interest rates are expressed as a decimal (e.g., 225% would be 2.25 in decimal form). Assuming this is a simple interest scenario, we will proceed with the given rate.

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Where:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = 2.25 (225% as a decimal)
- Time (T) = 3 years

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 6.75 \]

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 2025 \]

The total amount after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the simple interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The clothing store has 40 white shirts, and half of them have collars. So, the number of white shirts with collars is:
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
   Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is:
   \[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]

2. The clothing store has 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:
   \[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many trays the farmer can fill with 900 eggs.
2. Calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trays.
The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. So, the number of trays is:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.
The price per tray is $2.5. So, the total earnings are:

\[ 75 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.
2. He sells 10 goats from Farm X.
3. He sells twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, which means he sells \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate the number of goats left in each farm:

- Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\)
- Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

Finally, to find the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the goats left in Farm X and Farm Y:

- Total goats left: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

"To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

First, we know that James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount applied.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total cost.

Step 1: Cost of 3 baskets of green food
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Step 2: Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount
- Each basket of red food costs $18.
- With a $2 discount for each basket, the cost per basket of red food is \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Step 3: Total cost
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
- Total cost = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is **123 dollars**."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rooms that constitute one-half of the motel.
2. Determine the total time required to clean those rooms.
3. Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Step 1: Calculate one-half of the rooms.
\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Step 2: Determine the total time required to clean 45 rooms.
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals mentioned:

- Let \( B \) be the age of your brother.
- Let \( V \) be your age.
- Let \( S \) be the age of your sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of your mom.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( V = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( V = S + 2 \) or \( S = V - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( V + B + S + M = 87 \).

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( V \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:

\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 3 - 2) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:

\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:

\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( V \):

\[ V = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs are required to meet this need, considering he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
- There are 27 students.
- Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
- Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Step 2: Determine how many packs are required.
- Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
- To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack and round up to the nearest whole number because he can only buy whole packs and wants to have some extra glue sticks.
- 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.
- Since he can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 7 packs.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks."
"The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:

\[ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is:

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[ 14000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Each infected person infects six others every day, so the number of new infections each day is six times the number of infected people from the previous day.

Let's break it down day by day:

- **Day 0 (initial):** 10 people are infected.
- **Day 1:** Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
- **Day 2:** Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
- **Day 3:** Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections. The total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430."
"Rafaela received $20 from each of the forty customers, so the total amount of tips she received is:

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much less, we calculate 10% of $800:

\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = \$80 \]

So, Julieta received $80 less than Rafaela, which means:

\[ 800 - 80 = \$720 \]

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual amounts:

"Claire earns 1 badge every month. 

In a year (12 months), Claire would earn:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, so in the same 12 months, Amber would earn:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ badges}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so in 12 months, Wendy would earn:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges} \]

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number of badges Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

- Leftover burritos = 600 - 520 = 80.

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 + 10 + 30 = 52\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \( 28 \) books.

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
3. Calculate the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.**

Greg wants each of the 30 kids to have 4 jello cups. So, the total number of jello cups needed is:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.**

Each box makes 10 small jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per box:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

Each box of jello costs $1.25. Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, Greg will spend \(\boxed{15}\) dollars on jello."

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total monthly cost for Keenan.
2. Divide the monthly cost by 4 to find the weekly cost.

First, we know that Madeline pays 60% of the total monthly cost, so Keenan pays the remaining 40%. The total monthly cost is $400.

To find Keenan's share of the monthly cost:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly cost} = 40\% \times 400 = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the monthly cost by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly cost} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**: 10 pieces
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26

"To find out how much 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water will cost, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

1. Calculate the cost of one bottle of soda:
   - 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

2. Calculate the cost of one bottle of water:
   - 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.
   - Therefore, the cost of one bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

3. Calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
   - The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
   - The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts.
Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money.
David initially has $12.48, so after buying the bolts, he has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To find out how much Ella would earn after 12 hours, we first need to determine her hourly rate of earning.

Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. So, her hourly rate is:

\[ \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour} \]

Now, to find out how much she would earn after 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12:

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the cost price of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them:

\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Next, we know that he plans to sell these chickens at $50 each. So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is the total revenue minus the profit:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for:

\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses the boys sold in total.

The total number of glasses sold by the boys is:
32 (total glasses) - 14 (Julie's glasses) = 18 glasses

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 / 2 = 9 glasses

Micah sold 9 glasses of lemonade.

To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold:
14 (Julie's glasses) - 9 (Micah's glasses) = 5 glasses

Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( y \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can first find the speed of a thingamabob.

Let the speed of a thingamabob be \( x \) meters per second. Then, the speed of a whatchamacallit is \( 11x \) meters per second. We know that:

\[ 11x = 121 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \]

So, a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.

Now, a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.
3. In the first week, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
4. In the following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.

Let's denote the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \).

Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

Since Joe paid her $6 for her work, and assuming the payment per mowing is the same for all lawns, we can say that the total amount she earned from mowing lawns is $6.

Now, let's calculate the total number of lawns mowed:
- First week: \( x + 3x = 4x \)
- Second week: \( x + 5x = 6x \)
- Total: \( 4x + 6x = 10x \)

Since she earned $6 for mowing 10x lawns, the payment per lawn is \( \frac{6}{10x} = \frac{3}{5x} \).

Now, we can calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:
- First week: \( 4x \times \frac{3}{5x} = \frac{12x}{5x} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \) dollars
- Second week: \( 6x \times \frac{3}{5x} = \frac{18x}{5x} = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6 \) dollars
- Total from mowing lawns: \( 2.4 + 3.6 = 6 \) dollars

Since Tasha made a total of $80, and $6 of that was from mowing lawns, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Therefore, Tasha made $74 from lemonade sales."

Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the total amount of soup Calvin has in terms of bowls.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls
- 8 child bowls

Since Calvin and his wife are both adults, they will each have 1 adult bowl, which totals 2 adult bowls for the adults. This leaves us with 2 adult bowls worth of soup for the children.

Each child's bowl is half the size of an adult's bowl, so 2 adult bowls are equivalent to 4 child bowls (since 2 adult bowls * 2 child bowls/adult bowl = 4 child bowls).

Calvin has 8 child bowls in total, and after the adults have their bowls, there are 4 child bowls left.

Since there are 2 children, we divide the leftover 4 child bowls by 2 children:

4 child bowls / 2 children = 2 child bowls per child

So, each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

Each child will be able to have 2 bowls of soup for lunch."

"To find out how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then add them together.

For the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- To make 1 small mask, she would need \( \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \) yards of material.
- To make 20 small masks, she would need \( 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \) yards of material.

For the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- To make 1 large mask, she would need \( \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \) yards of material.
- To make 8 large masks, she would need \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = 10 yards (for small masks) + 6 yards (for large masks) = 16 yards.

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \).

Given that Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).

Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can write the equation:

"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. So, for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8.00 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8.00 = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
2. Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in that time.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one. Therefore, the time to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, half an hour is 30 minutes. To find out how many 30-minute intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes per bottle} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( R = 20 \) (twenty red balloons)
- Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna, so the total bologna for red balloons is \( 2 \times R = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) pieces.
- Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, so the total bologna for yellow balloons is \( 3 \times Y \).
- The total bologna thrown is 58 pieces.

We can set up the equation for the total bologna:
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Now, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so he drives a total of:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, the number of tune-ups he needs in that time is:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time."
"On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

To find the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days, we add the hours from each day:

\(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\)

Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

12 pieces are left."
"First, let's determine the number of students playing each sport:

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice that number playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students are playing volleyball.
- For soccer, there are \(16 + 22 = 38\) students.

Now, we add the number of students from each sport to find the total number of students:

\[6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56\]

So, the total number of students is 56."
"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together per day:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices/day}} = 4 \text{ days}
\]

The loaf of bread will last 4 days."
"Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old and continued until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years. Since she collects one shell every month, over 5 years, she would have collected 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 shells.

"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Therefore, in each row, there are:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of chamomile tea and 4.5 cups of mint tea} \]

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days, given that it is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day:

\[ \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water:

\[ \text{Water remaining in the tank} = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Let's break down the expenses and earnings step by step.

1. **Initial Spending:**
   - Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, so he has spent \(5 \times 10 = \$50\) on movie tickets.
   - He has also seen 8 movies on other days, so he has spent \(8 \times 7 = \$56\) on movie tickets.
   - He had 2 tubs of popcorn, so he has spent \(2 \times 8 = \$16\) on popcorn.
   - He had 4 boxes of candy, so he has spent \(4 \times 2 = \$8\) on candy.

2. **Total Spent:**
   - Total spent so far: \(50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = \$130\).

3. **Remaining Budget:**
   - Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is \(150 - 130 = \$20\).

4. **Current Day:**
   - It's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, so he wants to see a movie and get a popcorn and a box of candy that night.
   - Cost for a movie on a Friday or Saturday: \$10.
   - Cost for popcorn: \$8.
   - Cost for a box of candy: \$2.
   - Total cost for the night: \(10 + 8 + 2 = \$20\).

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, the mini cinnamon roll has:
   \[
   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, the mini blueberry muffin has:
   \[
   \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. Adding the total calories from both types of pastries gives:
   \[
   40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

From the information given:
- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's sum these up to get the total number of Junebugs removed:

39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs

There are 5 days in the week (Monday through Friday), so we divide the total number of Junebugs by 5 to find the average:

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we first need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went than the car:
- Difference in distance = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

First, we add up the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of toys to find out how many bouncy balls there are:
62 (total toys) - 48 (other toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls.

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can fit 2 boxes:

- Total boxes: 60
- Boxes per table: 2

So, the number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed: 30
- Tables already owned: 15

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per month: 43,200
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per month: 32,400
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by paying for the additional hours instead of a full 24-hour stay is:
1600 pesos (24-hour rate) - 1350 pesos (actual cost) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, we can calculate the hay needed for each sheep as follows:

Twice the amount each goat needs: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds
3 pounds less than that: \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

Now, we can calculate the total hay needed for the goats and sheep:

For the goats: \(15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/goat} = 75 \text{ pounds}\)
For the sheep: \(12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/sheep} = 84 \text{ pounds}\)

Adding these together gives the total hay needed:

\(75 \text{ pounds} + 84 \text{ pounds} = 159 \text{ pounds}\)

Nate needs 159 pounds of hay."
"First, let's calculate how much money John earned in the week:

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he wants to deposit $100 in the bank:
\[ 250 \text{ dollars} - 100 \text{ dollars} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each:
\[ 5 \text{ pencils} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how many $25 pens he can buy with the remaining $100:

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself."
"To calculate the total charge for the job, we need to add the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. **Visit Charge**: $40
2. **Labor Charge**: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we round up 2.25 hours to 3 hours (as partial hours are charged as full hours). So, the labor charge is $35 * 3 = $105.
3. **Parts Charge**: $60

Now, we add these charges together:

\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 205 \]

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 \text{ per CD} = \$200 \]

Now, we need to determine how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. We subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total cost he paid:

\[ \$90 - \$200 = -\$110 \]

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained money. However, the question asks how much money he was ""out,"" which implies a loss. In this case, he was not out any money but gained $110. 

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$110 \]"

   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 * $2 = $20.

3. Earnings from carrots:
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
- Total earnings = Earnings from yams + Earnings from sweet potatoes + Earnings from carrots
- Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - \( 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time it takes to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time to swim 12 miles: \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time: \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance: 20 miles.
   - Distance already swum: 12 miles.
   - Remaining distance: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - James swims at half the initial speed.
   - New speed: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - Time to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour: \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final numerical answer is:
450"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, so she has:

15 - 7 = 8 stickers.

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times sales.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal sales.
3. Add the two amounts to get the total commission.

Let's start with the New York Times:

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission from the New York Times is:
\[ 6 \text{ copies} \times \$5 \text{ per copy} \times 10\% = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 = \$3 \]

Now, for the Wall Street Journal:

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission from the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 10 \text{ copies} \times \$15 \text{ per copy} \times 8\% = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 = \$12 \]

Adding the two amounts together gives the total commission:
\[ \$3 + \$12 = \$15 \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \$15 \]"
"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the three players is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equations for \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each paper is printed on both sides, one side of a paper corresponds to one page in the book. Therefore, the number of pages in the book can be calculated by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

\[ \text{Number of pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \]

\[ \text{Number of pages} = 150 \]

So, the book has 150 pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Calculate the total number of reports stapled based on the number of 15-minute intervals.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. 

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports he can staple in each interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Actual Sleep Duration:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is the actual time Kim was asleep.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 480 minutes.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
   - Total actual sleep duration: \(480 + 55 = 535\) minutes.

5. **Subtract Sleepwalking Time:**
   - Total sleep duration: 535 minutes.
   - Sleepwalking duration: 23 minutes.
   - Actual sleep on bed: \(535 - 23 = 512\) minutes.

**Final Answer:**
Kim slept on her bed for 512 minutes that day."
"Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.

Since Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the remaining measuring spoons to the number of measuring cups to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 \text{ (cups)} + 10 \text{ (spoons)} = 34
\]

**Total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining: 34**"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Number of unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initial occupied beds = 200.
   - New admissions = 700.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Total capacity = 1000 beds.
   - Total occupied beds = 900.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

1 email/day"
"If Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, then Shawna is:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, Shawna's father is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can set up the following equation to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then the number of balls Jeffrey carried would be half of Jason's, and the number of balls Jordan carried would be twice Jeffrey's. So, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball, and Jordan carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls.

Therefore, the total number of balls carried would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \]

Since this is the same as \( 7J \), we can set up the equation:

\[ 7J = 5 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = \frac{5}{7} \]

However, since the number of balls must be a whole number, and the problem implies that the number of balls carried by each boy is a whole number, we need to reconsider the interpretation. The problem's setup suggests a proportional relationship, and the only way to satisfy the condition with whole numbers is if the total number of balls is a multiple of 5 when Jason carries 2 balls.

Given the proportional relationship, if Jason carried 2 balls, then the total number of balls is 5. Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
- Holes at the end of the first day: 10
- Holes dug on the second day: 13
- Net increase on the third day: 6

Total holes at the end of the third day: \(10 + 13 + 6 = 29\)

4. **Fourth Day**: The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes, so four times that is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) holes.

Let \(x\) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is the number of holes at the end of the third day plus the number of holes dug on the fourth day:
\[29 + x = 40\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

**Final Answer:**
11"
"Let's denote the number of corn chips that Collins received as \( C \).

Since Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, the total number of corn chips they received is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the cost of the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is given as $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the cost of the travel tickets to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. \( X + S + A = 339 \)
2. \( X = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4A - 13 \)

First, we can substitute the expression for \( X \) from the second equation into the first equation:

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( S \) from the third equation into the equation above:

\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]
\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]
\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught \( 147 \) Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Each episode is 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes in total.

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

10 episodes * 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.

200 minutes"
"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374 \, \text{miles}}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
2. At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen (6) brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen (48) brownies from her friends.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had at the start of the day and how many were left after the surprise party.

Total brownies at the start:
- 12 (from Greta) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies

Brownies eaten during the surprise party:
- 18 brownies

Brownies left over:
- 66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day."
"Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani. To find 25% of Nani's age, we calculate \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\). So, the sister is \(8 - 2 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

**Total age: 30**"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up the total time:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all of the racquets."
"John needs to buy 4 phones in total (one for himself, one for his wife, and one for each of his 2 kids).

The first two phones are at full price, which is $600 each. So the cost for the first two phones is:
2 * $600 = $1200

The remaining two phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So the cost for the last two phones is:
2 * $300 = $600

Adding the cost of all four phones together:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."
"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we first need to determine the number of players on Zeke's team. 

Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} + \text{Number of players on Carlton's team} \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 20 + 13 \]
\[ \text{Total number of players} = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total number of boxes is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

This means she sold the remaining boxes, which is:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
\[ 5 \times 20 = 100 \]

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 100 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be represented as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost of the books is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide $25 by $5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler has to work \(\boxed{5}\) hours to afford the books."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we add up the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we get \(30 + 20 = 50\) cherries.
4. This means Jerry must have \(60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:

\[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Final numerical answer:
20"

- Apple pie sold: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread sold: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie sold: 15 boxes

**Costs:**
- Gingerbread: $6 per box
- Apple pie: $15 per box

**Calculating earnings for each day:**

**Saturday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

**Sunday earnings:**
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes * $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

**Total earnings for two days:**
- Saturday + Sunday = $150 + $315 = $465

**Final numerical answer:**
$465"
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen Pamela will use during her vacation.
2. Determine how many bottles are required based on the total usage.

First, let's find out how much sunscreen Pamela uses in total. She reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour and will be outside for 4 hours a day. Over 8 days, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:

\[ 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen. We do this by dividing the total amount of sunscreen by the amount each bottle contains:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

The final numerical answer is:
$160"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

Since Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

Similarly, his brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

**50**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
2. Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, which is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) beads.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = \(20 + 30 + 40 = 90\)

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount of Thursday, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is \(3 + 12 + 6 = 21\) pounds.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

**Final Answer:**
7 servings"
"First, let's calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Since 20% of the class are football players, we can find this number by calculating 20% of 30:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We can find this number by calculating 25% of 24:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 cheerleaders or band members.

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early today."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit in the 111-foot long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week (7 days), his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

**63**"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost of the petunias for one basket:
- Each basket has 3 petunias.
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the cost of petunias for one basket is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket:
- Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines.
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Therefore, the cost of sweet potato vines for one basket is \(2 \times 2.50 = 5\) dollars.

Now, let's find the total cost for one basket by adding the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines:
- The total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 baskets:
- The total cost for 5 baskets is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Therefore, Katherine will spend \(\boxed{70}\) dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the 4 sunflowers:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

For the 10 carnations:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

The total bag of soil is 30 pounds, so the remaining soil for roses is:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, we calculate how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes:

25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Next, we determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the amount she sets aside each month:

$500.00 / $1,000.00 per pair = 0.5 pairs per month

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, we consider only the whole pairs she can buy each month, which is 0 pairs in this case.

Now, to find out how many pairs she can buy in a year:

0 pairs per month * 12 months = 0 pairs in a year

Final numerical answer:
0"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for both tasks:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Cooling from low setting: \(+6\) degrees
- Cooling from high setting: \(+12\) degrees
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the first time. Since Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, we can denote this as:

\[ \text{Age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet} = 30 \]

Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time is:

\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the Comet the second time} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sighting of the Comet is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ \text{Bill's age when he saw the Comet the first time} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks/year}
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips each day. These trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips each day.

2. Out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of the flights are to Greece. So, the number of flights to Greece is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66\).

3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The remaining flights are \(88 - 66 = 22\). Since these 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's find the total length of time the three wolves howl combined:

\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam's trousers cost $30.
- His mother gave him $6.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(A = 3\)
- \(B = 4\)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\).
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\).

First, substitute the known values into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{2(7 + H + W)}{4}\]
\[H = \frac{14 + 2H + 2W}{4}\]
\[4H = 14 + 2H + 2W\]
\[2H = 14 + 2W\]
\[H = 7 + W\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(H + W = 13\)
2. \(H = 7 + W\)

Substitute the second equation into the first:
\[7 + W + W = 13\]
\[7 + 2W = 13\]
\[2W = 6\]
\[W = 3\]

So, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"First, we need to determine the total amount of money collected from Walter's neighbors and the online fund. 

The amount collected from neighbors is $500, and the amount collected from the online fund is $1500. Adding these together:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. The total amount donated by everyone else is $2000. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6000. 

Final answer:

"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church next door by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

Therefore, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all the slices:
\[ 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult gets \( 2x \) of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
1.5 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 6.5 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the 9 hours available:
9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

So, Doctor Jones will have 2.5 hours left to update his records.

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the 5:00 pm serving time, accounting for all the required steps.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes (or 3 hours).

Now, subtract 3 hours from the 5:00 pm serving time:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which is \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, which is \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:

\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is \(480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are:

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[ \text{Babies born per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[ \text{Babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and after a year, the population will increase by the number of babies born in that year. Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is:

\[ \text{Total porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume of the pool is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the final cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, they have a total of 34 sticks.

"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps in one hour.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps in one hour.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps in one hour.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\(10 - 5 = 5\)

Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water remaining = \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

**Final Answer:**
6000 gallons"
"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 55.8\% \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{55.8\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of that cost for a down payment. So, the amount she needs to save is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save that amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the fruits he has bought:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. 

**Final Answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne has:

Total packs = 15
Sweets per pack = 60

Total sweets = Total packs × Sweets per pack
Total sweets = 15 × 60
Total sweets = 900

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

Packs given to friends = Total packs - Packs kept
Packs given to friends = 15 - 2
Packs given to friends = 13

Now, we need to find out how many sweets were in those 13 packs:

Sweets given to friends = Packs given to friends × Sweets per pack
Sweets given to friends = 13 × 60
Sweets given to friends = 780

Anne gave these 780 sweets equally among her 10 friends:

Sweets per friend = Sweets given to friends ÷ Number of friends
Sweets per friend = 780 ÷ 10
Sweets per friend = 78

Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this case is the formula for compound growth:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the final price after \( n \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal)
- \( n = 3 \) years

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album and then figure out how many of those are selfies and portraits.

First, we find out how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and put them into 8 albums, so we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album contains 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are for selfies only and 2 of the albums are for portraits only. This means there are:

\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

albums that are either selfies or portraits. Since each of these 5 albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies and portraits is:

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:

\[ 45 \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can set up a proportion:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{18 \text{ pages}}{x \text{ minutes}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{18 \text{ pages} \times 10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]

\[ x = \frac{180}{3} \]

\[ x = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

James spends 60 minutes reading."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 guests checked in, and the number of guests increases by 30:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (L \times x) + (S \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = (12 \times x) + (4 \times 2x) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for each package:

1. For the first package:
   - 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50

2. For the second package:
   - 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, which is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability = 50% or 0.5

- **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% = 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3 or 30%

- **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Does Not Get a Personal Extension:**
  - Probability = 50% * 60% * 80% = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider the overlap and correct for it. The correct way to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is to find the complement of the probability that he does not have to turn it in.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to:

\[ 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 = 1.04 \]

Since the total probability cannot exceed 1, we need to correct for the overlap. The correct calculation is:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.5 \times 0.3 - 0.5 \times 0.24 - 0.3 \times 0.24 + 0.5 \times 0.3 \times 0.24) \]

But for simplicity, we can just subtract the sum of the individual probabilities from 1:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24) = 1 - 1.04 = -0.04 \]

Since this is not possible, we need to consider the correct overlap, which simplifies to:

\[ 1 - (0.5 + 0.3 + 0.24 - 0.15 - 0.12 - 0.072 + 0.036) = 1 - 0.856 = 0.144 \]

So, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

\[ 14.4\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ \boxed{14.4\%} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats already accounted for (graduates and faculty).
2. Subtract this number from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are available for tickets to be given to friends and family.
3. Divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.

Let's do the math:

1. Total seats for graduates and faculty: \(950 + 300 = 1250\)
2. Available seats for tickets: \(6000 - 1250 = 4750\)
3. Number of graduates: (not given, so let's assume it's \(G\))
4. Tickets per graduate: \(\frac{4750}{G}\)

Since the number of graduates (\(G\)) is not provided, we can't give a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume there are 100 graduates (as an example), then:

\[
\text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{100} = 47.5
\]

Since you can't give half a ticket, the number of tickets each graduate would receive would be 47, with some tickets left over.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money with his new, higher income.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have worked for 4 years without going to college.
   - Total amount earned without college = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had worked during college:**
   - Since he didn't work during college, he lost out on $25,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount lost = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and make up for the lost income:**
   - Total amount needed = Total amount borrowed + Total amount lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His income tripled, so his new annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

6. **Calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the total amount needed:**
   - Time needed = Total amount needed / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school."
"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width
Area of one piece = 8 feet × 10 feet
Area of one piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 2 × 80 square feet
Total area = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries:**
   - The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries:**
   - One-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \)
   - 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries: \( 85 + 17 = 102 \)
   - So, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 102 letters.

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries:**
   - Twice as many as Tuesday's deliveries: \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \)
   - 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday's deliveries: \( 204 + 5 = 209 \)
   - So, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 209 letters.

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters
   - Wednesday: 209 letters
   - Total: \( 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \)

The post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad and then add them together.

For the chicken salad:
10 people * $6.50 per person = $65.00

For the pasta salad:
6 people * $6.00 per person = $36.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

The total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5 (a net loss of $10.5)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17
\]

So, the average loss per race is approximately $7.17.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\boxed{7.17}

"To find the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cities in South America.
2. Calculate the total number of people living in these cities.

Step 1: Number of cities in South America
There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Therefore, the total number of cities is:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Step 2: Total number of people
Each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population is:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ 130,000 \]"
"First, let's convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the final heights of Cole and Xavier will be in inches.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).

The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x = 1920 - 240 \]
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
\[ x = \frac{1680}{4} \]
\[ x = 420 \]

The share of the first person is $420.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Determine the total fraction of a day worked per day.
3. Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
4. Calculate the total hours worked by the team.
5. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find the hours each painter worked.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The painters worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days they worked is:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. Each painter worked \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day every day.

3. To convert \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day to hours, we multiply by 24 (since there are 24 hours in a day):
   \[
   \frac{3}{8} \times 24 = 9 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked by the team per day is:
   \[
   4 \text{ painters} \times 9 \text{ hours/day} = 36 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

5. The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
   \[
   36 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 756 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. To find the hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
   \[
   \frac{756 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 189 \text{ hours/painter}
   \]

So, each painter put in 189 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms and eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:

\[
2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010, which is a span of 3 years. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. 

The formula for the value of an item after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"To find the number of Spanish books, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 50 books in total.
2. Half of them are written in English, so there are \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) English books.
3. 10% of them are written in German, so there are \( 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \) German books.

"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 \text{ SqFt} \div 1 \text{ SqFt/tile} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

**Final Answer:**
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles is \$2400."
"First, let's calculate the increased monthly cost of the insurance after the accident.

The normal cost is $120 a month. It increased by 60%, so we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

So, the new monthly cost is $192. To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily food consumption for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part, which is 18 minutes longer, is:

\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost for 6 pounds of butter with the promotion:

1. For the first pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

$125 (rent) + $126 (additional guests) = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie and Riza originally had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and she has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. Let's denote Maggie's original amount of money as \( M \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80.

Next, we need to determine how much money Riza originally had. Riza spent one-third of her money, and she has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. Let's denote Riza's original amount of money as \( R \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{3}{2} \):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90.

Now, we need to calculate how much money each of them has left. Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left. Therefore, the total amount of money they have left together is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
3. Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in one day is:
\[10 + 14 + x = 24 + x\]

Since the total number of bananas is enough to feed the monkeys for a week (7 days), we can write the equation:
\[7(24 + x) = 315\]

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[168 + 7x = 315\]
\[7x = 315 - 168\]
\[7x = 147\]
\[x = \frac{147}{7}\]
\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed all 500 pieces of the second puzzle.

To find the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour, we add the pieces from both puzzles:

250 pieces (from the first puzzle) + 500 pieces (from the second puzzle) = 750 pieces

Therefore, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour."
"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, we can determine the cost of a single rose by dividing $15 by 12:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we can find the cost of 15 roses by multiplying the cost of one rose by 15:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny will receive is the difference between the amount she brought and the cost of the roses:

\[ \text{Change} = 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \div 0.25 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters. 

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the earnings from each item and then sum them up.

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Number of milkshakes: 6
   - Price per milkshake: $5.50
   - Total from milkshakes: \(6 \times 5.50 = 33.00\)

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Number of burger platters: 9
   - Price per burger platter: $11
   - Total from burger platters: \(9 \times 11 = 99.00\)

3. **Sodas:**
   - Number of sodas: 20
   - Price per soda: $1.50
   - Total from sodas: \(20 \times 1.50 = 30.00\)

Now, we sum up the totals from each item to get the overall total:

- Total from milkshakes: $33.00
- Total from burger platters: $99.00
- Total from sodas: $30.00

Total money made: \(33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00\)

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.00."
"Let's break down the timeline step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes after it arrives. The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves, which is 100 minutes after the first train arrives. The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 120 minutes after the first train arrives. This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at time 0. The first train arrives at 10 minutes and leaves at 30 minutes. The second train arrives at 40 minutes and leaves at 45 minutes. The third train arrives at 100 minutes and leaves at 100 minutes. The fourth train arrives at 120 minutes.

Paul will wait 120 minutes for his train.

In total, Paul will wait for his train for 120 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has already saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks she saves per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total required:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

The price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend paid $1800 for it. The discount amount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought:
- Jenny bought 10 bunches.
- Each bunch averages 4 bananas.
- Therefore, the total number of bananas is \(10 \times 4 = 40\).

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Therefore, the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for 10 bunches is \(10 \times 3.00 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, let's find the difference in cost between buying individually and buying in bunches:
- The cost of buying individually is $32.
- The cost of buying in bunches is $30.
- Therefore, the amount saved is \(32 - 30 = 2\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of bales per hour:**
   - The net change in the number of bales per hour is the difference between the hay produced and the hay picked up.
   - Net change per hour = Hay produced per hour - Hay picked up per hour
   - Net change per hour = 5 bales - 3 bales = 2 bales

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Since the net change is 2 bales per hour, over 6 hours, the total net change is:
   - Total net change = Net change per hour * Number of hours
   - Total net change = 2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - Since the farmer starts with no bales in the field (assuming the field was empty before starting), the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is the total net change.
   - Number of bales left = 12 bales

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is **12**."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long.

Total class time per day = 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total class time for the week is:

Total class time per week = 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends 1/16 of his weekly class time on these days.

Extra learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week * (1/16) = 100 minutes/week

Now, we add the class time and the extra learning time to get the total learning time per week:

Total learning time per week = 1600 minutes/week + 100 minutes/week = 1700 minutes/week

To convert the total learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Total learning time per week in hours = 1700 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 28.3333 hours/week

Therefore, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning."
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is the height of the third floor, which is 24 feet.

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the height will be:
\[ 24 \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the height will be:
\[ 16 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{32}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is \(\frac{32}{3}\) feet.

Final numerical answer:
\[
\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}

"Let's break down the heights of each child step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height in inches is:
   \[ 6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
   \[ 72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
   \[ 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
   \[ 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) kilograms.

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ x = 1080 \]

So, the Triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is \(80 \times 2 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all the walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then add those distances together.

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour. After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
After 3 hours, the distance it has traveled is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[ 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the annual amount needed for retirement is \( 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \) dollars.

2. Calculate the total amount needed for a 20-year retirement period:
   - The total amount needed is \( 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \) dollars.

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - Therefore, the amount saved each year is \( 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save the total amount for retirement:
   - The total amount needed is $800,000.
   - She saves $20,000 each year.
   - Therefore, the number of years needed is \( \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \) years.

Since Lauren plans to save for a 20-year retirement period, and it will take her 40 years to save the required amount, she needs to work for an additional 20 years beyond her planned retirement period.

Final answer:

"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each of these parts, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters} \]

Each of these 25 centimeter parts is then divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these final parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters} \]

So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long."
"To find the total population of the school, we can use the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil, then subtract the coupon amount.

Cost of pots: $19

Coupon discount: $7

Total cost before coupon: $19 + $26 = $45
Total cost after coupon: $45 - $7 = $38

Your mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to calculate the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we add these totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Now, we divide this total by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \] inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, which has 30 days, Soledad needs to cover:

\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day} \]

Soledad is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, which totals:

\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day} \]

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the distance she plans to hike from the distance she needs to hike:

\[ 310 \text{ miles per day} - 250 \text{ miles per day} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

60 miles per day"
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from red balls:
   - Number of red balls: 3

   - Total revenue: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

The store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"First, let's determine how much Pierre and Paul want in kilograms.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

Since Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples in total, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, James will have 5 kg of apples left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the new temperature was:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond starts with $21.
2. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
3. He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. He spends $19 on a puzzle.

First, we add the money he saved to his initial amount:
\[ 21 + 11 = 32 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the comic book:
\[ 32 - 5 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract the cost of the puzzle:
\[ 27 - 19 = 8 \]

So, Raymond has $8 left.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Anna's initial budget: $16
2. Amount spent before buying the 2 books: $4
3. Amount left after buying the 2 books: $2

First, we need to find out how much Anna spent on the 2 books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget after spending $4:

\[ \text{Amount spent on 2 books} = \text{Initial budget} - \text{Amount spent before} - \text{Amount left} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on 2 books} = 16 - 4 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on 2 books} = 10 \]

Since Anna bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the 2 books by 2:

\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{\text{Amount spent on 2 books}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = \frac{10}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cost of each book} = 5 \]

So, each of the books cost $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the increase in the number of students:
20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10

So, the number of students enrolled this year is:
50 (last year's enrollment) + 10 (increase) = 60

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Given:
- 255 blinks in 5 minutes

We need to find the time \( t \) for 459 blinks.

First, we find the rate of blinks per minute:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Now, we use this rate to find the time for 459 blinks:
\[ t = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} \]

\[ t = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times."

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan's dog-walking chore took 2 hours longer than Amalia's, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

Dior's laundry took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's 4 hours, but since we don't have a specific number for ""well over,"" we can assume the minimum time that is ""well over 4 hours"" is 5 hours (since 4 + 1 is not ""well over,"" but 4 + 2 is). So, Dior took 4 + 5 = 9 hours to do the laundry.

Adding up the time for all chores:
Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 70 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so the total monthly distance is:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total production from these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Adding the production of the first four workers together, we get:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:

105 pounds"
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers Luis had were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Luis received \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers from Seth.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
   \[
   120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car is:

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Vince is now 9 years old."
"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \(A\), by Madeline as \(M\), by Camden as \(C\), and by Sarah as \(S\).

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \(A = M\).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah: \(C = S + 12\).

First, we can use the third piece of information to express \(C\) in terms of \(S\):
\[C = S + 12\]

Now, substitute \(C\) in the second equation:
\[S + 12 + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now that we know \(S = 9\), we can find \(C\):
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Next, we know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So, we can write:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]
Since \(A = M\), we can substitute \(M\) with \(A\):
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from his 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \, \text{crayons} \times 1 \, \text{ounce/crayon} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \, \text{boxes} \times 8 \, \text{ounces/box} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \, \text{ounces} + 200 \, \text{ounces} = 400 \, \text{ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \, \text{ounces}}{16 \, \text{ounces/pound}} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of the usable part of the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet tall.
   - John can make logs out of 80% of it.
   - Usable length = 80 feet * 80% = 80 * 0.8 = 64 feet.

2. **Calculate the number of 4-foot logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = Usable length / Length of each log = 64 feet / 4 feet = 16 logs.

3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   - From each log, he cuts 5 planks.
   - Total number of planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 16 * 5 = 80 planks.

4. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total earnings = Total number of planks * Price per plank = 80 * $1.2 = $96.

Therefore, John makes $96."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. 

Her brother earns twice Valerie's salary, so he earns \(2 \times 5000 = 10000\) dollars per month.

Their combined salary is \(5000 + 10000 = 15000\) dollars per month.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns \(2 \times 15000 = 30000\) dollars per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is \(5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach.

Let's denote her speed on the beach as \( v \) miles per minute. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, we can write:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The sidewalk portion of the trail is 1 mile. To find out how long it takes her to walk this 1 mile, we use her speed on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk to get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had \(60 - 24 = 36\) marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his current marbles. Since Bob currently has 36 marbles, if he loses 10, he will have \(36 - 10 = 26\) marbles.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

Let's assume the second mug is at the minimum temperature that allows the mixture to be at least 40 degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:
\[ \frac{\$36.00}{36 \text{ bagels}} = \$1.00 \text{ per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion based on the information given:
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then \(x\) potatoes make 18 scoops.
   - We can write this as \(\frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{18}\).

4. Solving for \(x\):
   - Cross-multiplying gives \(3 \times 18 = 2 \times x\).
   - So, \(54 = 2x\).
   - Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 27\).

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"To find the number of blue jellybeans, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of red jellybeans.
2. Calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans.
3. Subtract the total number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.

Step 1: The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Step 2: The total number of green and red jellybeans is:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Step 3: The number of blue jellybeans is the total number of jellybeans minus the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

In a decade (10 years), the total number of lemons he collects is:
\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
300 lemons"
"To solve this problem, we can start by determining the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

Dividing both sides by 14, we find:

\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the initial number of men and women:

- Number of men: \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women: \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
2. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.**

- Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers per day.
- Each sunflower costs $2.
- Therefore, the number of sunflowers sold per day is $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.**

"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

\[ \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5 \text{ per rock}} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many rocks he sells, which is 60% of his inventory.

\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling 12 rocks at $7 each.

\[ \text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84 \]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue from selling the rocks is $84. To find out how much money he loses, we subtract the revenue from the initial investment.

\[ \text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16 \]

Therefore, Adam loses $16."

- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, the probability of winning with the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ 12\% \]"

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's calculate the total number of seashells they collected:

- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:

**Final Answer: 30 carrots**"
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday:
- He bought 2 devices last Monday, so the profit from Monday's devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
- He bought 4 devices last Tuesday, so the profit from Tuesday's devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Adding the profits from both days gives us the total profit:

"To find the length of Carl's cane, we need to determine Carl's height first. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Isabel's height is given as 7 feet.
2. Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned's height is:
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl's height is:
   \[
   5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of Carl's cane is:
   \[

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).
3. For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be \(2300 \times 5 = 11500\) bottles.

Now, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce to meet the demand, we subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the total number required:

\(11500 - 4200 = 7300\)

Hortex would have to produce 7300 more bottles of juices to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

7300"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of his remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left (40 - 10 = 30).
6. He then sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * $3 = $90 from the last sale.

Now, let's add up all the money he earned from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Third sale: $90

Total money earned = $50 + $30 + $90 = $170

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs found by adding the eggs found by each person:

- Lamar: 5 eggs
- Stacy: 10 eggs
- Charlie: 8 eggs
- Mei: 4 eggs

Total eggs found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

Since Cole hid 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:

\(36 - 27 = 9\) eggs.

"First, let's determine the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

"Let's break down the information given:

- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- A 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old produces as \(x\). So, an 8-year-old produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- A 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10 years:

- Year 5: 50 fruits
- Year 6: 150 fruits
- Year 7: 350 fruits
- Year 8: \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits
- Year 9: 0 fruits
- Year 10: 1000 fruits

Adding these up:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first relationship into the third equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Next, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the second relationship into the equation above:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have the length of the yellow rope, we can find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]
\[ B = 12 - 7 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4B \]
\[ R = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."

1. **Determine the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.**

3. **After giving money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money:**
   - Rissa's remaining money is \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15

Therefore, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

According to the problem, the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, so we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

We are also told that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{total paint} \]

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we have:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Now, we can express the total amount of paint as the sum of the amounts of each color:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( R = W = P \) and \( Y = 6 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ 3R = 6 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**
   - If each pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can get \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) pods.

   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. Thomas then triples his money. The amount of money he has is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. The number of 5 dollar bills he has is:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"In the first half:
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Total number of goals scored in the match:
- Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
- Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

Total goals = 6 (Team A) + 10 (Team B) = 16 goals

The total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can continue to use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Remaining chalk = 5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

2. **Determine the number of days the teacher can continue to use 20% of the chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \).

- After the first day, the teacher uses 20% of 2.75 inches, so the remaining chalk is:
  \[
  C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]

- After the second day, the teacher uses 20% of 2.20 inches, so the remaining chalk is:
  \[
  C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
  \]

- After the third day, the teacher uses 20% of 1.76 inches, so the remaining chalk is:
  \[
  C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
  \]

- After the fourth day, the teacher uses 20% of 1.408 inches, so the remaining chalk is:
  \[
  C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
  \]

- After the fifth day, the teacher uses 20% of 1.1264 inches, so the remaining chalk is:
  \[
  C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
  \]

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the teacher has \(\boxed{5}\) days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."
"To find the number of students not on varsity, we first need to determine how many girls and boys are on varsity, and then subtract those numbers from the total number of girls and boys, respectively.

1. Calculate the number of girls on varsity:
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \).

2. Calculate the number of boys on varsity:
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \).

3. Calculate the number of girls not on varsity:
   - Total girls - Girls on varsity = \( 12 - 4 = 8 \).

4. Calculate the number of boys not on varsity:
   - Total boys - Boys on varsity = \( 12 - 3 = 9 \).

5. Calculate the total number of students not on varsity:
   - Girls not on varsity + Boys not on varsity = \( 8 + 9 = 17 \).

Final numerical answer:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
   - Therefore, the number of teeth capped = 4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 teeth.

3. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - Teeth fixed = Teeth drilled + Teeth capped = 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - Total teeth = 30
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (Number of teeth fixed / Total number of teeth) * 100
   - Percentage of teeth fixed = (15 / 30) * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50%

The final numerical answer is:

50%"
"First, we need to determine how much milk Mr. Marcellus returned to the company. He returned 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk.

\[ \text{Amount of milk returned} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. The refund is based on the cost per gallon, which is $3.5.

\[ \text{Refund amount} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5/\text{gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost per book.
2. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
3. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books he can buy per school.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the cost per book is:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000:
\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books} \]

Since Bob distributes the money equally among 3 schools, the number of books he can buy per school is:
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices consumed will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices/friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices/friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\).

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) pizza pies."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Snowballs Built Per Hour:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes:**
   2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is:
   \[
   2 \text{ snowballs/15 minutes} \times 4 = 8 \text{ snowballs/hour}
   \]

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour:**
   The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs/hour} - 8 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 12 \text{ snowballs/hour}
   \]

4. **Time to Build 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how long it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age when Digimon came out and then find out how old he is now.

1. First, we need to find out how many years ago Digimon came out. Since Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.

2. We know that John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 28 - 20 = 8 years old.

3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

4. Now, to find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Therefore, Jim is 24 years old now."
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 + 50 - 28 = 34\] bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they received:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages. They also used half a pack, which is:
   \[0.5 \times 50 = 25\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[34 + 100 - 25 = 109\] bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial count of bandages they started with on the first day. Let's denote the initial number of bandages they started with as \(x\).

So, the equation for the end of the third day would be:
\[x + 50 - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + 100 - 66 + 100 - 25 = 78\]
\[x + 109 = 78\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

It seems there was a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let's recheck the problem statement and the logical flow. The correct interpretation should be that the initial number of bandages plus the net addition and subtraction over the three days should equal 78. Let's re-calculate with the correct setup:

Starting with \(x\) bandages, after the first day:
\[x + 50 - 38 = x + 12\]

After the second day:
\[x + 12 + 50 - 28 = x + 34\]

After the third day:
\[x + 34 + 100 - 25 = x + 109\]

Setting this equal to 78:
\[x + 109 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 109\]
\[x = -31\]

This indicates an error in the problem's setup or an inconsistency. Given the problem's constraints and the logical flow, the correct initial number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he was paid for that task, and then sum up all the amounts.

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac to find the total amount spent:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

1. First, we find the number of fish with red stripes. Since one-third of the fish have red stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

2. Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, there are 44 fish remaining.

3. Now, we find the number of fish with blue stripes. Since 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 fish with blue stripes.

4. Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to get the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which had 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which originally had 6 colors. Half of 6 is 3, so she uses 3 colors. Therefore, \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
3. The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

First, we calculate the height of the house:
\[ \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the first floor:
\[ \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we can find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof. Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the remaining height is for the second floor and the space above it (up to the roof):
\[ \text{Height from the second floor's floor to the roof} = \text{Total height of the house} - \text{Height of the first floor} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

We know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the miles needed for the last dog, we subtract the total miles for the first three dogs from the total miles for all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"First, we calculate the amount of the loan John gets by taking 40% of his home's value:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts by taking 60% of the loan amount:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount to find out how much money he has leftover:

\[ \text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 

Total weight of the tunas = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

Now, if a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we can calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram.

Total earnings = 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To calculate Trinity's profit, we first need to determine the selling price of the magazines.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

So, the selling price is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Now, let's calculate the selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"To find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends threw, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons.

First, let's calculate the total number of balloons:

- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons:

- They had 12 balloons left at the end of the afternoon.

So, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of balloons they threw is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the amount of the second medicine. The problem states that the second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine. Since the first medicine is 14 mL, the second medicine would be:
   \[
   3 \times 14 \text{ mL} = 42 \text{ mL}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find the total amount of medicine for one dose. This is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts:
   \[
   14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. Finally, to find the total amount of medicine for 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine for one dose by 8:
   \[
   56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL}
   \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL."
"First, let's determine the capacity of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[ \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students} \]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[ \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ students} \]

Now, we know that Ali's school has a capacity of 120 students. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[ \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students} \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students."
"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen will owe his sister including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen will owe is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total Paid in 11 Months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount minus the amount already paid:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so for 2 children, that's 5 changes/child/day * 2 children = 10 changes per day.

Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, so she changes 10 changes / 2 = 5 changes per day.

Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is also 5 changes per day.

Final numerical answer:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
5. Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base with side lengths of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. The volume \( V \) of the jar is given by:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The total number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.**

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's estimate to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. The difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the number of people on the bus became:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we subtract the current number of people on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

The total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is multiplied by 2.5 (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original cost).
   - Therefore, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is \(2 \times 2.5 = 5\) dollars.

3. **Number of Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - For the first 5 years, she visited the museum \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - For the next 3 years, she visited the museum \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit was $2, so the total cost for 15 visits is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit was $5, so the total cost for 9 visits is \(9 \times 5 = 45\) dollars.
   - The total amount spent over 8 years is \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is **75 dollars**."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.
2. Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.
3. Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who get to try the escape room.**

There are 10 students in each of the 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th) who get to try the escape room. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 4 \text{ grades} = 40 \text{ students} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed.**

To find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from 40 students, we divide 40 by 8:
\[ 40 \div 8 = 5 \text{ groups} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room.**

Each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Since there are 5 groups, and they can work simultaneously, the total time required is the time it takes for one group to complete the escape room, which is 45 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{45 \text{ minutes}} \]"

   - So, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

2. The cost of the roof frames:
   - John made 2 roof frames.
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

3. Adding the costs together:
   - Total cost for tables: $80
   - Total cost for roof frames: $20
   - Therefore, the total amount Ali has to pay John is \(80 + 20 = 100\) dollars.

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we calculate its length as:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."
"To determine how much of the secret steakhouse seasoning Aiden will need, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - He wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the amount of ground beef needed is \( \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning needed is \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \).

Therefore, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."
"First, we calculate the total width of the windows:

Each window is 35 inches wide, and there are 5 windows, so the total width is:
\[ 35 \, \text{inches/window} \times 5 \, \text{windows} = 175 \, \text{inches} \]

Luke needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, so:
\[ 175 \, \text{inches} \times 2 = 350 \, \text{inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - $0.25 per minute
   - 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. Cost for the remaining minutes (36 - 16 = 20 minutes):
   - $0.20 per minute
   - 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

Now, we add the costs together:
- Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B \]

We know that there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To calculate the total cost for Karen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails (10 on each hand).
3. Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

### Step 1: Calculate the discounted price for both a manicure and a pedicure
- The original price for a manicure is $35.
- The original price for a pedicure is $40.
- The discount is 20%, so the discount amount for each service is 20% of the original price.

Discount for manicure: \( 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \)
Discounted price for manicure: \( 35 - 7 = 28 \)

Discount for pedicure: \( 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \)
Discounted price for pedicure: \( 40 - 8 = 32 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of adding nail art to all 20 nails
- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- Karen has 20 nails (10 on each hand).

Total cost for nail art: \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)

### Step 3: Add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art
- Total cost for both services: \( 28 + 32 = 60 \)
- Total cost including nail art: \( 60 + 60 = 120 \)

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $120."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues per year, the total number of magazines is simply the number of different magazines she subscribes to, which is 3 (the 12-issue magazines) + 1 (the 6-issue magazine) + 1 (the 24-issue magazine) = 5 magazines.

So, the final numerical answer is:

\(\boxed{5}\)"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Let's break down the price changes step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: $40

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   - 80% of $40 = 0.80 * $40 = $32
   - New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   - 50% of $72 = 0.50 * $72 = $36
   - New price in January = $72 - $36 = $36

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"First, let's calculate the amount Charlie makes from the 4 standard 1-hour lessons. 

At his standard rate of $80 per hour, for 4 lessons, he makes:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The rate is reduced by 25%, so the new rate is:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For 2 1-hour lessons with veterans, he makes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. The formula to calculate the percentage is:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     1.00 \text{ (pasta)} + 3.00 \text{ (cheddar cheese)} + 6.00 \text{ (gruyere cheese)} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
     \[
     10.00 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 520.00 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{520.00}

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated by dividing the average time spent cleaning per day by the total available time per day and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes/day}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase = \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times \$2.40 = \$12.00 \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since she earns $1 for each set of 3 eggs, her total earnings will be:
\[ 20 \times \$1 = \$20.00 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:
\[ \$20.00 - \$12.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \$8.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \) hats.
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) hats.
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \) hats.
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is the remaining hats after accounting for the red and blue ones, which is \( 50 - 30 = 20 \) hats.

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"To find the cost per stick of jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discounted price of the bag.
2. Calculate the total cost per stick.
3. Convert the cost per stick to cents.

Step 1: The original price of the bag is $18.00, and there is a $3.00 discount. So, the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. So, the cost per stick is:
\[ \frac{15.00 \text{ dollars}}{30 \text{ sticks}} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we have:
\[ 0.50 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes by substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 4 people, so there are 4 flashlights.
2. There are 8 rooms, so there are 2 flashlights per room, which means \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
3. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms with small candles. This means \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
4. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are also \(4\) rooms with medium candles. This means \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

Now, let's add up all the flashlights and candles:

- Flashlights: \(4 + 16 = 20\)
- Candles: \(16 + 20 = 36\)

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(20 + 36 = 56\).

Chips per person = 110 chips / 5 people = 22 chips/person

Each person gets 22 chips."
"To solve this, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. The sixth side is not mentioned, but since the problem states ""once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides,"" we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Total time = \(5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5\) minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 32.5 minutes."

"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training:

His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, he is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, so the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time in minutes is:
\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate triples, so \(20 \times 3 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate quadruples, so \(20 \times 4 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is halved from the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Adding these to the total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[210\]"
"To determine how many lemons Tim will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon but will be more concentrated.
   - Therefore, Tim needs 4 gallons + 1 gallon = 5 gallons of lemonade in total.

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - For 1 gallon of lemonade, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
   - For 4 gallons, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
   - For the extra gallon, since it is twice as tart, he still needs 1 cup of lemon juice (the same as a regular gallon).

3. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed:**
   - Total lemon juice needed = 4 cups (for 4 gallons) + 1 cup (for the extra gallon) = 5 cups of lemon juice.

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, to get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need 5 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 30 lemons.

**Final Answer:**
Tim will need 30 lemons."

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. First, calculate the distance traveled west:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. Next, calculate the distance traveled east:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. Now, find the net distance from his house:
   - Distance traveled west = 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east = 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year and apply it to the boat's value step by step.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \( x \).
4. The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 24 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers."
"To find out how many screws James will have left over, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the tables:
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Total legs = 4 tables * 4 legs/table = 16 legs.

2. Calculate the total number of screws needed for all the legs:
   - Each leg needs 2 screws.
   - Total screws needed = 16 legs * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.

3. Calculate the number of screws left over:
   - James has 40 screws.
   - Screws used = 32 screws.
   - Screws left over = 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws.

So, James will have 8 screws left over."
"There are 10 eggs in the first basket. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it has 2 * 10 = 20 eggs.

Adding the eggs from both baskets together: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine how much each person raised:

- Alexandra raises $430.
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raises $300.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up the amounts raised by all of them:

- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Maryam: $700
- Sarah: $300

Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to find out how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times \text{Speed of Aaron} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time taken by Vanessa} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."
"To calculate how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of meals and wine for one reservation.
2. Calculate the total cost for one night.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of meals and wine for one reservation.**
- They order 2 meals at $5 each: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.
- They also order a $5 bottle of wine.
- Total cost per reservation: \(10 + 5 = 15\) dollars.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for one night.**
- They get 6 reservations a night.
- Total cost per night: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.**
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
- Total cost per week: \(90 \times 2 = 180\) dollars.

Therefore, the restaurant makes **$180** a week."
"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\boxed{2.00}

"First, let's determine Dora's current age. If Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

James is currently twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

John had James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

**8**"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

First, let's determine how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Next, let's determine how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges.
- Jane peels 15 oranges.
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To find out how much Mark paid in total, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then add these two amounts together.

1. Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: $400 * (1 - 0.80) = $400 * 0.20 = $80

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: $50 * 3 = $150

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - Total cost = Cost of radiator + Labor cost
   - Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230."
"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( C \):
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
