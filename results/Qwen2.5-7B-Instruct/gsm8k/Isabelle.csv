"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses is:

3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for baking) = 7 eggs

The remainder of the eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is:

16 (total eggs) - 7 (used eggs) = 9 eggs

She sells each egg for $2, so the amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

9 (eggs) * $2 (per egg) = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market."
"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, which means it takes 1 bolt of white fiber (since half of 2 is 1).

In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber."
"To calculate Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to add 150% of the original purchase price to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price is $80,000. A 150% increase on $80,000 is calculated as:
\[ 150\% \times 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, which includes the purchase price and the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints, each 60 meters, 3 times a week. 

So, the total distance he runs in one session is:
3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
180 meters/session * 3 sessions/week = 540 meters

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
540 meters"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken eats in a day.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily feed requirement to find the final meal amount.

Step 1: Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day.

Step 2: Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total for these two meals is:
\[ 15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Step 3: The total daily feed requirement for 20 chickens is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Now, subtract the total morning and afternoon feed from the daily requirement to find the final meal amount:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens \(\boxed{20}\) cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this down into 8 pairs of glasses, where each pair consists of one glass at $5 and one glass at $3.

For each pair:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.

So, the cost for each pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost is:
8 pairs * $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses."
"If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston, which has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, has:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep} \]

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has:

\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep} \]

Together, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have:

\[ 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \text{ sheep} \]

260"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = 0.40 * 200 GB = 80 GB

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - 60% of 200 GB = 0.60 * 200 GB = 120 GB

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

6. **Add the total time for the download:**
   - Total time = 60 minutes (first 40%) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (remaining 60%) = 140 minutes

So, the total time it takes to download the file is 140 minutes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours.

1. **First Leg of the Trip:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - He then drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time of 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:**
   - Total distance covered on the return trip = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - He covered 135 miles on his return trip.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance covered on return trip = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."

"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330.

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

- Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

The total cost is $694."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Cost**: $90
2. **Annual Growth**: 7 lemons per year
3. **Selling Price per Lemon**: $1.5
4. **Annual Cost to Water and Feed**: $3

First, calculate the net profit per year:

- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/year
- Net profit per year: \(\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5\)

Next, we need to find the number of years (\(n\)) it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree:

\[ \text{Net profit per year} \times n = \text{Initial cost} \]
\[ \$7.5 \times n = \$90 \]

Solving for \(n\):

\[ n = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \]

So, it will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This leaves her with \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners.

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after these sales. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. To solve for \( x \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]

6. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12
   \]

7. Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]

8. Finally, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

"First, let's calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Now, 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance. To find out how many students that is, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 \]

So, 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following formula:

\[ \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.6 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 * 1.025 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 * 1.012 = $8,096

Now, we compare the final values to determine the profit:

- Profit from jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final profit: $96**"
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days. 

To find the total distance covered by each train, we simply add the distances together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She earns $20 per hour.
- She works 35 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:
\[ 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from teaching are:
\[ 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She earns $30 per hour.
- She works 15 hours a week.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:
\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Her annual earnings from coaching are:
\[ 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Finally, we sum up her annual earnings from both jobs to get her total annual salary:
\[ 35000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57500 \, \text{dollars/year} \]

Her annual salary is:
\[ \boxed{57500} \]"
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in 4 weeks, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.

If she makes a 3 egg omelet every day, then in 28 days, she will have eaten 3 * 28 = 84 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is 84 / 12 = 7 dozens.

7 dozens"
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to hike the 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.
2. Determine the time already spent hiking.
3. Calculate the remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance.
4. Find the required speed for the remaining distance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to hike 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.**

The formula for time is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the total time required to hike 12 miles at 4 miles per hour is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the time already spent hiking.**

Marissa has already spent 1 hour on the first 4 miles and another hour on the next 2 miles, so she has spent:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining time she has to hike the remaining distance.**

The remaining time is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

**Step 4: Find the required speed for the remaining distance.**

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

The required speed is:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
6 miles per hour"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in both the orange and pineapple drinks, then account for the spill, and finally sum the remaining water.

1. **Calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - The orange drink is 10 liters, and it is two-thirds water.
   - Amount of water in the orange drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters.

2. **Calculate the amount of water spilled:**
   - You spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
   - Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the spilled liter contains \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a liter of water.
   - Amount of water spilled = \( \frac{2}{3} \) liters.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of water in the orange drink:**
   - Remaining water in the orange drink = \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is 15 liters, and it is three-fifths water.
   - Amount of water in the pineapple drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \) liters.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters:**
   - Total water = Water from the remaining orange drink + Water from the pineapple drink
   - Total water = 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

The final numerical answer is:
15 liters"
"Samantha is currently 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son at the age of 23. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to determine how many years ago Raymond turned 23.

Since Raymond is currently 25, he turned 23 two years ago.

"Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).

Given that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means he paid 75% of the original price. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = 26.00 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00."

"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, so in 60 days, she will consume 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings and costs $4.00. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost for 4 cartons is:

\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00 \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream."
"Henry's total trip is 60 miles. He stopped after 20 miles, so the distance remaining after his first stop is:

60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means he had traveled 15 miles from his second stop to the end. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is:

40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

25 miles"
"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

According to the problem, the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost \( 104 \) dollars.

104"
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that their total age now is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Dividing both sides by 18, we find:
\[x = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting \(x\) into \(11x\):
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109."
"The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first one's guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 60.

The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

To find the average guess, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

The average guess is 80."
"John spends 0.5 hours per dog each day. With 10 dogs, he spends:

0.5 hours/dog/day * 10 dogs = 5 hours/day

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:

\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he earns:

13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195

He buys 8 video games for $20 each, so he spends:

8 video games * $20/video game = $160

After buying the video games, he has $5 left, which means the total amount he spent on video games is:

$195 (total earnings) - $5 (leftover) = $190

Since he actually spent $160 on video games, the calculation confirms his earnings and spending.

The question asks how many lego sets he still has. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, the number of lego sets he still has is:

0

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day.

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   He runs half as much as the first day on the other two days. So, he runs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each of those days.

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total distance = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours of running.

4. **Total time run in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   Total time = \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours.

5. **Total distance run in a week:**
   John runs 60 miles a week.

6. **Average speed:**
   Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final numerical answer:**
10 miles per hour"
"Given that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and that her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed. If her skipping speed is half her running speed, then her running speed is:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the time allocation for running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking in a six-hour period. Therefore, the time spent running is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time spent walking is:

\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance traveled while running is:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

The distance traveled while walking is:

\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled in six hours:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, and Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, then Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces initially was:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total calories in the 300g bag is \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) calories.
   - The calorie content per gram is \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Determine the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\) calories.

3. **Calculate the grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since each gram of chips contains approximately 4.17 calories, the grams of chips you can eat with 200 calories is \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed to make 20 candles.
2. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed.
Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the supplies.
The cost of 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
If each candle is sold for $2.00, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.
The net profit is:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day.

- On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles on Tuesday is \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles on Wednesday is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \]

Total number of hours spent writing articles in the three days: 104"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
2. She purchased a package of Post-it notes (let's call this number \( x \)).
3. At work, she used 220 post-it notes.
4. After all these actions, she had 23 post-it notes remaining.

We can set up the equation to represent the total number of post-it notes she had:

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

163"
"First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5 \]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Since each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of each red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60 \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent on ties:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$200 + \$600 = \$800 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot piece of wire, we first need to convert the length of the wire into inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot piece of wire is:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of occupied units.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.
- Therefore, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Step 2: Determine the number of occupied units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.
- Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.
- The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Final numerical answer:

"Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can calculate the number of dozens produced per day:

\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, the daily revenue from selling the eggs is:

\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$42 \]

To find out how much Lloyd makes in a week, we multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in a week (7):

\[ \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Lloyd makes \(\$294\) on eggs per week."
"Tom is traveling back at a rate of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we need to know the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM. However, the distance is not provided in the question. 

Assuming the distance from his starting point to his destination is the same for both directions, let's denote this distance as \(D\) miles.

From 1 to 4 PM, he travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to travel back at 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes him 5 hours to get back."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes:

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight he needs to remove is:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
- Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
- Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
- Total revenue for Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Now, we compare the total revenue for both days:
- Thursday's revenue: $520
- Friday's revenue: $480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
$520 - $480 = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have just had kittens. 

Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is the sum of the adopted kittens and the kittens from their house cats:

\(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\)

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the maximum weight the bridge can carry.
2. Subtract the weight of the empty truck and driver from the bridge's weight limit to find out how much weight is available for the boxes.
3. Divide the available weight by the weight of each box to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

Let's go through the calculations:

1. The bridge's weight limit is 5000 pounds.
2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. The available weight for the boxes is \(5000 - 3755 = 1245\) pounds.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is \(1245 \div 15 = 83\).

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83."

"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year.

1. For the first half of the year, she pays $140 per month for 6 months.
2. For the second half of the year, she pays 10% less than $140 per month for 6 months.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the first half} = 140 \times 6 \]

Next, we calculate the reduced monthly cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Reduced monthly cost} = 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for the second half} = 126 \times 6 \]

Finally, we add the costs of both halves to get the total amount paid for the year:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (140 \times 6) + (126 \times 6) \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \]
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \]
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) efficiency. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 

To find the mpg, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{mpg} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full 12-gallon tank:

\[ \text{Distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

1. Each school has sent 2 teams (girls' and boys' basketball teams).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each school has also sent 2 coaches (one for each team).

So, for each school:
- Number of players = 2 teams * 5 players/team = 10 players
- Number of coaches = 2 coaches

Therefore, the total number of people sent by one school is:
- Total people per school = 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people

"Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) dollars.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of $100. This total is the sum of the money she started with and the allowance she received. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2 = $34

Finally, let's add up the totals:

$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Artie will make $88."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. Top level (Level 1): 16 square feet
2. Level 2: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) square feet
3. Level 3: \(8 \div 2 = 4\) square feet
4. Bottom level (Level 4): \(4 \div 2 = 2\) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:

\[\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Cecilia will feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, the first year will have 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining after the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy will consume:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

For the remaining 185 days, the puppy will consume:
185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups

So, in the first year, the puppy will consume a total of:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups

Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use in the first year is:
550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:

\( 200 \) pounds (Raymond) - \( 100 \) pounds (David) = \( 100 \) pounds.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in the two different package options.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each:

1. Determine how many packages of 3 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:
   \[
   6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1.00 each:

1. Determine how many packages of 2 flowers are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]
2. Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:
   \[
   9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we compare the two costs to find the better price and the savings:

1. Cost of 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
2. Cost of 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

The better price is buying in packages of 2, which costs $9.00. The savings by choosing the better price is:

\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"The original cost of the grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, the cost is reduced by 30% of $100.

30% of $100 = 0.30 * $100 = $30

So, the discount amount is $30.

Subtract the discount from the original cost:
$100 - $30 = $70

The final cost of the grooming is $70."
"Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so together they got:

\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 + \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = \frac{24}{6} + \frac{24}{6} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

Then a boy got 6 liters of water. So, the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy is:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water was 24 liters, so the amount of water left is:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

10 liters of water were left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers, so now he has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. He received 23 more stickers for his birthday, so now he has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister, so now he has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so now he has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers.

Therefore, the final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"Grace weighs 125 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs, so we calculate Alex's weight as follows:

4 times Grace's weight: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds
Alex's weight: \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds

Now, to find their combined weights, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:

\(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses.
2. Calculate the total number of thorns based on the number of roses.

Each rose has 8 thorns.
So, the total number of thorns is \(75 \times 8 = 600\).

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games they won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final numerical answer is:

"The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which means it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time, which means it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of rings from each time it went off:

4 (first time) + 12 (second time) + 6 (third time) = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in all."
"Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. The company increases the salary by 10% every year for employees who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just clocked 5 years in the company, she will start receiving the 10% increase from the sixth year.

Let's calculate her salary after each year of the next three years:

1. **End of Year 1 (6th year):**
   - New salary = Initial salary + 10% of initial salary
   - New salary = $600 + 0.10 * $600
   - New salary = $600 + $60
   - New salary = $660

2. **End of Year 2 (7th year):**
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $660 + 0.10 * $660
   - New salary = $660 + $66
   - New salary = $726

3. **End of Year 3 (8th year):**
   - New salary = Previous year's salary + 10% of previous year's salary
   - New salary = $726 + 0.10 * $726
   - New salary = $726 + $72.60
   - New salary = $798.60

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $798.60."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final numerical answer is:

Since Christina needs .75 gift bags per invited guest, the total number of gift bags she needs is:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost will be:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of potato salad one child will eat.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the adults.
3. Calculate the total amount of potato salad for the children.
4. Add the amounts from steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed.

Step 1: One child will eat half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 2: The total amount of potato salad for the 20 adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 3: The total amount of potato salad for the 5 children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Step 4: Adding the amounts from steps 2 and 3 gives:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

"Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. If Lee now runs it in 38 seconds, then before the diet change, Gerald would have run it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's new speed is 10% faster than his original speed. To find his new time, we can calculate 10% of his original time and subtract that from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is 0.10 * 40 = 4 seconds.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds."
"Given that the number of dogs is 60, and there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows:

Number of cats = 2 * Number of dogs
Number of cats = 2 * 60
Number of cats = 120

Now, we know the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we can calculate the number of rabbits as follows:

Number of rabbits = (Number of dogs + Number of cats) - 12
Number of rabbits = (60 + 120) - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout:

Fraction of girls in the girl scout = 2/3

Number of girls in the girl scout = 120 * (2/3) = 80

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
Number of girls not in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes before they are cooked into sauce.
2. Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used.
3. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the number of cans.

First, we know that the sauce made is 32 ounces, and the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. This means that the volume of the tomatoes before cooking was twice the volume of the sauce. So, the volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans of tomatoes were used to get 64 ounces of tomatoes. The number of cans used is:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam can be calculated as the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

This total of 25 cars is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the remaining 15 minutes:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of a single box, then calculate its inner volume, and finally multiply by 3 for the total volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions:**
   - The original dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - The walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side).

   - Inner length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
   - Inner width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
   - Inner height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**

"Let's break down the information given:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- Friday: 2 hours
- Total: 7 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday:

- Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hours

Since the total hours watched is 7, the hours watched on Wednesday would be:

- 7 - 5 = 2 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday by dividing the total hours watched on Wednesday by 0.5:

- 2 / 0.5 = 4 episodes

So, Frankie watched 4 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he had left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how many fruit roll-ups they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

For Marcell:
- His roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
- Total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by the number of people:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet Julia rows to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that enters the boat based on the given rate.

First, we find out how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find out how many feet she rows in 64 seconds:

\[
\frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{20 \text{ feet} \times 64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore.

Next, we need to calculate how much water the boat takes on during this 80 feet. We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, we can set up a proportion to find out how much water is taken on for 80 feet:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{y \text{ liters}}{80 \text{ feet}}
\]

Solving for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{2 \text{ liters} \times 80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.
3. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). According to the problem, \( 300 = 50 \times D \).

Now, we solve for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

Final answer:

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought and the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought:

- Sasha bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each.
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{board} = \$100
  \]

- Sasha also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each.
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16/\text{board} = \$80
  \]

- The total cost of the lumber is:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:

- Sasha is selling the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards. Since the price has increased by 50%, the new price is:
  \[
  \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$15/\text{board} = \$150
  \]

- Sasha is also selling the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The new price is:
  \[
  \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \text{ per board}
  \]
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$24/\text{board} = \$120
  \]

- The total revenue from selling the lumber is:
  \[
  \$150 + \$120 = \$270
  \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$270 - \$180 = \$90
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."
"The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts in the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined. Since the total parts are 20, each part is equal to 120 / 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar makes up 7 parts of the mixture, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons.

42 teaspoons"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

1. First, find the total number of pairs of shoes: \(2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
2. Then, calculate the total cost: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360\).

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each, which totals:

2 containers * 5 vehicles/container = 10 vehicles

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles already at the port from the new total:

30 vehicles (total) - 10 vehicles (initial) = 20 vehicles (added on the second day)

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:

20 vehicles / 5 vehicles/container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.

4 containers"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000
   \]
3. Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was:
   \[
   \frac{40000}{1.30} = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
   \]
4. Lylah's salary also increased by 40% four years later. So, her new salary is:
   \[
   30769.23 \times (1 + 0.40) = 30769.23 \times 1.40 \approx 43076.92
   \]
5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is the sum of Adrien's and Lylah's new salaries:
   \[
   56000 + 43076.92 = 99076.92

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets of paper. 

So, in a week, he uses:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he uses:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Julia bought a package of spoons.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
4. After using the 3 spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

So, the total number of spoons Julia had before using any was \( x + 5 \) (since her husband gave her 5 spoons).

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

"Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. B = 2Q (there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
3. The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700

Using the first relationship, we can express B in terms of Q: B = 2Q.

Using the second relationship, we can express W in terms of B: W = 2B. Since B = 2Q, we can substitute to get W = 2(2Q) = 4Q.

Now we can substitute W and B in terms of Q into the total number of bees equation:
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:
B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200
W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

- Milk: Food item (2 dollars)
- Eggs: Food item (3 dollars)
- Light bulbs: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Cups: Non-food item (3 dollars)
- Roach traps: Non-food item (4 dollars)

Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before tax:
- Light bulbs: 3 dollars
- Cups: 3 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars

Total cost of non-food items = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars

Now, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
10% of 10 dollars = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar

So, the total cost of the non-food items including tax is:
10 dollars (original cost) + 1 dollar (tax) = 11 dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
- Milk: 2 dollars
- Eggs: 3 dollars

Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon ate two-thirds of the fries, let's denote the number of fries as \( y \). The raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate 9 fries, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate 7 fries, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate 14 fries, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( 48 \).

Final answer:
48"
"Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That's 3 classes * 1 hour/class * 3 days = 9 hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. That's 2 classes * 2 hours/class * 2 days = 8 hours.

In one week, Kimo spends a total of 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours in classes.

Since there are 16 weeks of school in one semester, Kimo spends 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours attending classes in one semester.

272 hours"
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we need to calculate the length contributed by each type of baked good and then sum these lengths.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Number of rolls: 300
   - Length of each roll: 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Number of croissants: 120
   - Length of each croissant: 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes: 60
   - Length of each baguette: 2 feet (which is 24 inches)
   - Total length of baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

Now, we sum the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[3360 \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet."
"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the total banana consumption for each type of ape over that period and then sum them up.

1. Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas

2. Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas

3. Baboons: 100 bananas per month
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas

Now, we add up the total bananas needed for all the apes over 2 months:
\[400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\]

The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs. Since the football field is 100 yards long, running back and forth once is 200 yards. Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so:

\[ 200 \text{ yards/run} \times 15 \text{ runs} = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards, and she does this 34 times, so:

\[ 80 \text{ yards/run} \times 34 \text{ runs} = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser. Blake runs 3000 yards and Kelly runs 2720 yards, so the difference is:

\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper he bought.

1. Cost of pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
2. Cost of notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
3. Cost of bond paper: $20

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total amount spent:

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20
Total cost = $34

Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn initially watches 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 of them come out from under a lily pad, and 2 of them hide under a rock. 

So, the number of tadpoles he can see now is the initial number minus the ones that hid plus the ones that came out:

11 (initial) - 2 (hid under a rock) + 6 (came out from under a lily pad) = 15 tadpoles.

Finn can now see 15 tadpoles in the pond."
"On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water, so the depth is:
17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so the depth is:
(2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet

The tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."

- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

Anakin's total: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish
Locsin's total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish

Combined total: 19 + 13 = 32 fish

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase step by step, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.

1. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, the price after every two months can be calculated as the original price plus 20% of the original price.

Let's denote the original price as \( P_0 = 20 \) dollars.

After 2 months, the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 = 20 + 0.20 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

After 4 months, the price \( P_4 \) will be:
\[ P_4 = P_2 + 0.20 \times P_2 = 24 + 0.20 \times 24 = 24 + 4.80 = 28.80 \text{ dollars} \]

After 6 months, the price \( P_6 \) will be:
\[ P_6 = P_4 + 0.20 \times P_4 = 28.80 + 0.20 \times 28.80 = 28.80 + 5.76 = 34.56 \text{ dollars} \]

We can see a pattern here. The price after \( 2n \) months can be expressed as:
\[ P_{2n} = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20)^n \]

Since 36 months is equivalent to 18 two-month periods, we can substitute \( n = 18 \) into the formula:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

So, the price after 36 months is:
\[ P_{36} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is:
\[ \boxed{787.32} \]"
"Given:
- 5 red cars
- 3 action figures
- 1 doll

Costs:
- 1 red car costs $4
- 1 action figure costs $5
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures

First, let's calculate the cost of the doll:
- Since 1 action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the doll costs $15.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The cost of 3 action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The cost of the doll is $15.

Adding these together:
- Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of doll
- Total cost = \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the total cost of hiring the accountant and compare it to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 per hour for 3 hours.
   - Lost income = $35/hour * 3 hours = $105.

2. The cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

3. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - Difference = Lost income - Cost of accountant
   - Difference = $105 - $90 = $15.

So, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

"To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and then subtract that from her budget.

The cost of the computer is €1090.
The cost of the screen is €157.
The cost of the keyboard and mouse is €74.
The cost of the CD burner is €74.
The cost of the printer is €102.

First, we add up the costs of all the items:

\[ 1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102 = 1497 \]

Elvira's budget is €1500. So, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

\[ 1500 - 1497 = 3 \]

Therefore, Elvira will have €3 left for her clothing."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan. So, the total number of eggs required is:

15 flans * 3 eggs/flan = 45 eggs

Sandra's neighbor gives her a basket of 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

45 eggs / 9 eggs/babysitting = 5 babysitting sessions

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit 5 times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:
\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
16"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, then:

So, Jimmy has $18."
"Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, the total miles he walks from Monday to Friday is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. So, the total miles he walks on the weekend is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekend gives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week."
"The hat costs $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
\[ \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so:
\[ \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now, to find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

Each uniform costs a total of $150."

"To calculate the total time it will take Billy to prep the potatoes, we need to consider the time it takes to peel each potato and the time it takes to cut each potato.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 1.5 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to cut all 60 potatoes:
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut one potato.
- Therefore, for 60 potatoes, it will take \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds.

Now, let's convert the cutting time into minutes:
- \( 60 \times 5 \) seconds is equal to \( 300 \) seconds.
- Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, \( 300 \) seconds is equal to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) minutes.

Now, let's add the time for peeling and cutting:
- Time to peel: \( 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \) minutes.
- Time to cut: \( 5 \) minutes.
- Total time: \( 90 + 5 = 95 \) minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can use the information provided to find Mark's age and then Jean's age.

First, let's find Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

Half of Jan's age two years ago was 28 / 2 = 14 years.

So, two years ago, Mark was 14 + 5 = 19 years old.

Now, to find Mark's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21 years old.

Since Jean is two years older than Mark, we can find Jean's age by adding 2 to Mark's current age:

Jean's age = 21 + 2 = 23 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time each team takes to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team = 4 runners × 55 seconds/runner = 220 seconds.

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner takes 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner takes 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner takes 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

Total time for the less well-rounded team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team's time is 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team's time is 222 seconds.
Difference = 222 seconds - 220 seconds = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by 2 seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probabilities is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, it is 200% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
4. The total straw distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces.

First, let's calculate the straw used for the hamsters:
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- So, the total straw for the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Now, we know the total straw used for the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is 160 pieces. So, the straw used for the rats is:
\[160 - 50 = 110\] pieces.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, and the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, let's find out how many rats there are in total:
\[ \text{Total straw for rats} = 110 \]
\[ \text{Straw per rat} = 6 \]
\[ \text{Total number of rats} = \frac{110}{6} = \frac{55}{3} \approx 18.33 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, and the rats are in 3 cages in equal groups, the total number of rats must be divisible by 3. The closest whole number that fits is 18 (since 18 is divisible by 3 and close to 18.33).

So, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 6."

- Interest for the month: $102 * 2% = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
- Total amount after 2 months: $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

**Month 3:**
- Amount at the start of the month: $104.04
- Interest for the month: $104.04 * 2% = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
- Total amount after 3 months: $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

Rounding to the nearest cent, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12."
"Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought and sold as \( x \).

The cost to buy each bag is $20, and the cost to transport each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

The selling price per bag is $30. The profit per bag is:
\[ 30 - 22 = 8 \]

The trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, the total profit can be expressed as:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The tickets cost $20.25 in total. The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so the food cost is:

\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the rides. Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for a total of \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

Therefore, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks need per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.

Step 1: Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, and there are 10 ducks.
Total weekly need = 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Divide the total weekly need by 7 to find the daily need.
Daily need = 35 pounds/week ÷ 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of trees**: 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted per year**: 10 trees.
3. **Trees chopped down per year**: 2 trees.
4. **Net increase in trees per year**: \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
5. **Number of years**: 10 years.

First, calculate the total number of trees added over 10 years:
\[ 8 \text{ trees/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 80 \text{ trees} \]

Add this to the initial number of trees:
\[ 50 \text{ trees} + 80 \text{ trees} = 130 \text{ trees} \]

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Calculate 30% of 130 trees:
\[ 0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees} \]

Subtract the number of dead trees from the total number of trees:
\[ 130 \text{ trees} - 39 \text{ trees} = 91 \text{ trees} \]

So, the final number of trees left is:
\[ \boxed{91} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Friday Morning:** There are 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.

2. **Saturday Morning:** The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. They then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out. So, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \), and the number of white flamingos is 6.

3. **Sunday Morning:** The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. So, the number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \), and the number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **At Noon on Sunday:** We need to find how many more pink plastic flamingos there are than white plastic flamingos. The difference is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we first need to calculate how many pounds of carrots will be distributed to the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, so for 40 restaurants, the total amount of carrots distributed will be:

\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the distributed amount from the total amount of carrots to find out how many pounds will not be used:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

120 pounds"

There are 6277 children in Soda."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
2. After a month, she collected three times that number, which is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\), so in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Elaine has now:

- Initial cards: 20
- Cards after the first month: 60
- Cards after the second month: 40
- Cards after the third month: 200

Total cards = Initial cards + Cards after the first month + Cards after the second month + Cards after the third month
Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now in total."
"Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B each week.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns:
5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 2500 cents

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
10 cents/sentence * 500 sentences = 5000 cents

Adding the earnings from both publishers:
2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents

Mark makes 7500 cents in a week."

"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for Lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices of cheese for sandwiches: \(2 \text{ slices/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ slices}\).

2. **Omelets for Breakfast:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the scores Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 over 6 tests, with the lowest score removed.
2. Determine the lowest score from the first five tests.
3. Subtract the lowest score from the total sum needed.
4. Solve for the score on the sixth test.

First, let's calculate the total sum of scores needed to achieve an average of 93 over 6 tests:

\[ \text{Total sum needed} = 93 \times 5 = 465 \]

This is because the lowest score will be removed, and the average is calculated over the remaining 5 scores.

Next, we identify the lowest score from the first five tests:

\[ 71, 86, 89, 92, 100 \]

The lowest score is 71.

Now, we subtract the lowest score from the total sum needed:

\[ 465 - 71 = 394 \]

This is the sum of the remaining 5 scores (excluding the lowest score).

Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of the first five tests plus the sixth test, minus the lowest score, should equal 394:

\[ 71 + 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x - 71 = 394 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 + x = 394 \]

\[ 367 + x = 394 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 394 - 367 \]
\[ x = 27 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 97 on her sixth test to get an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{97} \]"

\[ 5 \text{ times/week} \times 25 \text{ km/time} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Then, he changed his routine and rode 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time for 3 weeks. So, the total distance for the second period is:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 60 \text{ km/time} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Adding the distances from both periods gives the total distance:

\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Micheal did a total of 860 kilometers."
"Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 20g.

Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g

Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."

To find the total number of cakes she bought after all three days, we add the number of cakes from each day:

\(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\)

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates would be 6 plates.
   - Therefore, the cost of half a dozen plates is \(6 \times 6000 = 36000\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
   - So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is \(36000 - 1200 = 34800\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one dozen cups:**
   - Twenty dozen cups cost $34800.
   - Therefore, one dozen cups cost \(\frac{34800}{20} = 1740\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of one cup:**
   - One dozen cups is 12 cups.
   - Therefore, the cost of one cup is \(\frac{1740}{12} = 145\) dollars.

The total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{145}\) dollars."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
The cost of 2 pairs of shoes is 2 * $20 = $40.
So, the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Sara will earn from babysitting and mowing the lawn.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.
Let's say Sara mows the lawn \( x \) times. She earns $4 each time, so she earns 4x dollars from mowing the lawn.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money Sara will have is $10 + $20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

We need this total to be at least $70. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 30 + 4x = 70 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x = 70 - 30 \]
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs a day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( W = R + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W = R + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park, which is a rectangle. The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his walking speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500.

To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers by the third day.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. We know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 \) gallons. This can be written as:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, we have:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has \( 8 \) gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay over 12 months is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find Janeth's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be $220."

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack based on the information provided.

1. Harriet's age = 21 years
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 21 * 2 = 42 years
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age = 21 * 3 = 63 years

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet's age = 21 + 3 = 24 years
- Zack's age = 42 + 3 = 45 years
- Adrian's age = 63 + 3 = 66 years

To find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:

2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, we calculate Yuri's points:
- Half of Naomi's points: \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points: \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

Next, we calculate Brianna's points:
- Brianna's points: \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points

6 days (bus trip) + 3 days (car trip) = 9 days

**Final answer: 9**"
"First, let's calculate the new total number of cards James has after losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 grass type cards.

- Initial number of fire type cards: 30
- Initial number of grass type cards: 20
- Initial number of water type cards: 40

After losing 8 water type cards:
- New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 = 32

After buying 14 grass type cards:
- New number of grass type cards: 20 + 14 = 34

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards:
- Total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is:
\[ 33 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
33"
"Let's break down the cost of Chad's burrito order:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces: $0.25 each, so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
- Upgrade for chips and a drink: $3.00

Now, let's add these costs together:

$6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract that from the total:

$14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda and her mom can place puzzle pieces:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of placing pieces:**
   - Together, they can place \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Determine the total number of pieces in the puzzle:**
   - The puzzle has 360 pieces.

4. **Calculate the time it will take to complete the puzzle:**
   - Time (in minutes) = Total pieces / Combined rate
   - Time = \( \frac{360}{6} = 60 \) minutes

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
3. The number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. When Ashlyn came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at that time is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. The number of watermelons remaining after harvesting the 63 ready ones is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything, we need to consider the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees.

1. **Cost of the cars:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total cost of the cars = $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

2. **Tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax on the cars = 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.

3. **Registration fees:**
   - Each car has a registration fee of $1,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   - Total registration fees = $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

4. **Total amount paid:**
   - Total amount = Cost of the cars + Tax on the cars + Registration fees
   - Total amount = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $276,000."
"On Monday, Robert collects 20 shells. Since Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, she collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"There are 36 penguins sunbathing initially.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner:
36 / 3 = 12 penguins

So, the total number of penguins that are no longer sunbathing is:
12 + 12 = 24 penguins

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
36 - 24 = 12 penguins

12 penguins are still left sunbathing."
"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day. Since he eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day.

Together, they eat 6 (Steve) + 3 (girlfriend) = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough cherry tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.

21 vines"
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
- There are 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are required.
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.
- Number of pizzas needed = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Ram starts with 25 pens.
2. After using these pens, he will have 25 empty pens.
3. He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. So, with 25 empty pens, he can make \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \) new full pens.
4. After making these 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens left from the process of making the new pens.
5. Now, he has 5 new full pens and 5 empty pens, making a total of 10 pens.
6. He can again mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen. So, with the 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new full pen.
7. After making this new pen, he will have 1 empty pen left.
8. Now, he has 6 full pens and 1 empty pen, making a total of 7 pens.
9. He can no longer make any more full pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen, and he only has 1 empty pen left.

So, the total number of pens he gets to have is the initial 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made from the first set of empty pens, plus the 1 new pen he made from the second set of empty pens. This gives us a total of \( 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \) pens.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

2. After the meeting, 30% of the students went out through exit A. 
   - 30% of 1000 = 0.30 * 1000 = 300 students.

3. The remaining students after 300 went out through exit A:
   - 1000 - 300 = 700 students.

4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   - 3/5 of 700 = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

5. The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   - Remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students.

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies. So we can write:
\[ 2R = 54 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
\[ J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they read each other's books as well as their own, we need to consider that each person will read all 3 books.

So, Dolly will read 3 books (her 2 books + Pandora's 1 book) and Pandora will also read 3 books (her 1 book + Dolly's 2 books).

Collectively, they will read a total of 6 books, but since they are reading the same books, the total number of books read by both of them is still 3, as each book is read by at least one person.

"Mike was originally a pen pal with 5 people and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = 3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, Mike receives 3 * 2 * 5 = 30 pages of letters a week.

Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 30 pages of letters a week.

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 180 minutes / 60 = 3 hours.

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week."
"Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month. 

Every day, he uses 15 minutes for a call with his boss. Over 30 days, he uses:
15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes

So, the total minutes used this month is:
450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra calls) = 750 minutes

Subtracting the total minutes used from the monthly plan:
1000 minutes (plan) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes

Jason has 250 minutes left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

The total number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 4 + 32 = 36 \).

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. The difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The number of fish in each aquarium is 7."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist's services.
2. Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist's services.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.

Let's start with the daily cost:

- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours each day.
- Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

Next, we calculate the weekly cost:

- She needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
- Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

Now, we calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks of the movie:

- Total cost for 5 weeks = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

- 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
- Discounted total cost = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid $27000."

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

So, in total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.

Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) more calories than her sister.

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars killed today as \( C \). Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \( 3C \).

It is also given that Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night. So, \( C = 15 - 3 = 12 \).

Now, we can find the number of wolves killed today:
\[ 3C = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, today Rick killed 36 wolves and 12 cougars.

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we add the animals killed last night and today:

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. So, we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times."
"First, let's determine the initial number of cows in the ten stalls. Since each of the ten stalls has 20 cows, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Next, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the twenty stalls. So, the number of new cows in each stall is:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we add the new cows to the original number of cows in each stall:

\[ 20 \text{ original cows/stall} + 2 \text{ new cows/stall} = 22 \text{ cows/stall} \]

To find the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by 8:

"Each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds. Since the redwood is 200 feet tall, it has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections).

The total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any part of it would be:
20 sections * 400 pounds per section = 8000 pounds.

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 30% of 8000 pounds is:
0.30 * 8000 pounds = 2400 pounds.

The remaining weight of the redwood after the termites have eaten is:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
4. Andrea has 52 apples.

From point 1, we can write:
\[ \text{Andrea's apples} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
Since Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ 52 = \text{Jamal's apples} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44 \]

From point 3, we know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
\[ \text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \]

From point 2, Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ \text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{\text{Jamal's bananas}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = \text{Andrea's apples} + \text{Andrea's bananas} + \text{Jamal's apples} + \text{Jamal's bananas} \]

   Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000
   Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $400,000
   Brokerage fee = $20,000

3. Calculate the total fees and loan amount to be subtracted:
   Total fees and loan = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
   Total fees and loan = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000
   Total fees and loan = $282,000

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees and loan
   Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   Net proceeds = $118,000

Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time for each part.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** It takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:** It takes 5 minutes less time than the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - The total heating time is \(20 + 28 = 48\) minutes.
   - So, the cooking time is \(48 - 5 = 43\) minutes.

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:** This is the sum of the heating time and the cooking time.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 43 = 91\) minutes.

**Final numerical answer:**
91 minutes"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

First, calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, each house has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) windows in the bedrooms.

Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is:
- \(2 \times 6 = 12\) windows.

Next, calculate the number of additional windows in each house:
- Each house has 4 additional windows.
- Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
- \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

Finally, add the number of bedroom windows and the additional windows to get the total number of windows:
- \(12 + 8 = 20\) windows.

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the information given:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so the collar takes \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so the rosette takes \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
4. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 \text{ (body)} + 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the number of stitches for the two sleeves combined is:
\[ 1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 1170 \text{ (body, collar, and rosette)} = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches} \]

Each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds: 20 * $40 = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds: 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, we add the total costs for both types of seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Total cost for all seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so Sean has to memorize \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines from the second scene.

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize: \(54\) (solo song) + \(36\) (first scene) + \(48\) (second scene) = \(138\).

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

"To calculate the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time for the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 minutes = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes

3. Add the total time for small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

"The sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.
- There are also 3 coaches.

So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 24 (guests) + 3 (coaches) = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each pizza costs $15, so:

13 * $15 = $195.

Maddy will spend $195."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Divide the length occupied by the sterling silver beads by the length of each bead to find the number of beads.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. So, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones, the length occupied by the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find the number of beads, we divide the length occupied by the beads by the length of each bead:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ inch/bead}} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ beads}

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. So:
- Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members, each consuming 0.2 kg of rice per meal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household.
\[ 0.2 \, \text{kg/person/meal} \times 5 \, \text{persons} = 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Assuming each person eats rice at both lunch and dinner, the household consumes rice twice a day.
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise started with 250 books.
2. There are currently 50 unsold books.
3. This means she has sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. She sold 45 books this year.
5. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.
6. The total number of books sold so far is \(90 + 45 + \text{second year sales} = 200\).

From this, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year:

\[ 50 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month of April, Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so Watson's total earnings for the month are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them.

First, calculate how many people he beat:
80% of 20 = 0.80 * 20 = 16 people

"The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

First, calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:
Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \]

So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning. This leaves:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \]

Next, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, half of the 20 remaining loaves are sold:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
\[ 10 \div 2 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:

"To determine the number of new limbs a person will grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate how many times the serum will cause the person to grow an extra arm and an extra leg within that period.

- An extra arm is grown every 3 days.
- An extra leg is grown every 5 days.

First, we calculate the number of extra arms grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms} \]

Next, we calculate the number of extra legs grown in 15 days:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the number of extra arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs:
\[ 5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ limbs} \]

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs."

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.
4. Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, which means the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

Now, we need to find the current population of Chile. The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now. Therefore, the current population is twice the population six years ago.

So, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Final numerical answer:

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).

It also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{1}{2}D \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 3.5D = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3.5:

\[ D = \frac{105}{3.5} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is 14."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Solomon has now is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} \).
7. Therefore, \( P = 15 \).

The total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 of 40 is 10 people.

This means 30 people stayed at the party (40 - 10 = 30).

We are told that 22 men stayed at the party. Since there were originally 25 men, the number of men who left is 3 (25 - 22 = 3).

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 must be women (10 - 3 = 7).

Therefore, the number of women who stayed at the party is the original number of women minus the number of women who left. Since 7 women left, the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils.
- We need to find out how many pencils are in each box. Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \). Therefore, the total number of pencils in the three boxes is \( 3x \).
- Adding the 2 loose pencils, we get the equation: \( 3x + 2 = 26 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{3} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:

- Jam has 26 pencils.
- Meg has 46 pencils.

Total pencils = Jam's pencils + Meg's pencils
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to calculate the number of ice cubes added and then use that to find the total weakening effect from the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes added:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon's coffee is cooled by 65 degrees.
   \[
   \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect from the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect from the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee.
   \[
   \text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   \[
   \text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records the people received.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are given up.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records given up as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records."
"First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month. Therefore, the total amount paid to junior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their monthly salary is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total amount paid to senior programmers per month is:

\[ \text{Total for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding the amounts paid to both junior and senior programmers gives us the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge. 

Since the phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, to find out how long it will take to recharge 40 percentage points, we can multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 / 60 = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice that amount, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) baby outfits.

Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

\[24 + 48 + 15 = 87\]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters, which means he should run:

\[ 5000 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 5000\right) = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day} \]

June typically has 30 days. So, if Tyson trains for a month in June, the total distance he would cover is:

\[ 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180,000 meters."

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies, 5 days a week. So, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is:
4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats:
1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

Now, we can calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband in a week:
20 cookies (son) + 7 cookies (husband) = 27 cookies/week

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total number of cookies consumed by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in a bag:
36 cookies (total) - 27 cookies (consumed by son and husband) = 9 cookies

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies."

$36 - $15 = $21.

Andrea saved $21."
"First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming:

- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time John spent watching shows:

- Shows: 3 shows * 2 hours each = 6 hours

Now, we know that the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows (9 + 6 = 15 hours) is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time as \( T \). We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:

\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \]

So, the total time John spent on vacation is 50 hours.

Now, we need to find out how much time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time:

\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \]

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing."
"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract the amount she already has in savings from the cost of the phone.

1. Calculate earnings from the first job:
   - Earnings = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

2. Calculate earnings from the second job:
   - Earnings = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

3. Calculate total earnings from both jobs:
   - Total earnings = $200 + $75 = $275

4. Calculate the total amount Annabelle has after adding her savings:
   - Total amount = $80 (initial savings) + $275 (total earnings) = $355

5. Calculate how much more she needs to save:
   - Amount needed = $400 (cost of the phone) - $355 (total amount) = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45."
"The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so:
6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, so first we find the combined height of the shortest and second trees:
6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet

Now, we multiply this combined height by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree:
17 feet * 2 = 34 feet

The tallest tree is 34 feet tall."

"Let's break down the costs first:

1. One round of mini-golf for Morgan: $5
2. Arcade tokens: $5
3. Go-karts (2 rides): $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for Morgan is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan has a budget of $90. After accounting for her own expenses, the remaining budget for her friends is $90 - $30 = $60.

Each friend will need to pay for one round of mini-golf and one ride on the go-karts, which costs $5 + $10 = $15 per friend.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend:

$60 / $15 = 4

Morgan can invite 4 friends."
"Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each. 

The cost of 4 lollipops is:
4 lollipops * $0.25 per lollipop = $1.00

So, each day she saves:
$5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she puts in her piggy bank is:
$4.00 per day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Billy has after buying the candy:**
   - Billy starts with $10.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys.
   - The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound, so the total cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \).
   - After buying the candy, the amount of money he has left is \( 10 - 1.5x \).

2. **Calculate the amount of money spent on gumballs:**
   - Billy takes half of his remaining money to buy gumballs.
   - He spends this money on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.
   - He buys 40 gumballs, so the total cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, half of his remaining money is $2, which means his remaining money is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Set up the equation to find the amount of money left after buying the candy:**
   - We know that after buying the candy, he has $4 left.
   - So, \( 10 - 1.5x = 4 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4

"First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip between the three cities.

1. Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
2. Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
3. Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}\]

So, the train goes between services every 20 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed:
   - A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed.
   - The average is calculated as (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds.

2. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
   - Each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.

3. Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
   - Each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.

4. Add the amounts together to find the total amount of stuffing needed:
   - Total stuffing = stuffing for chihuahua beds + stuffing for collie beds
   - Total stuffing = 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
2. The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that many minus 5. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   Therefore, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
3. The number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21
   \]
   Therefore, 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
4. Now, we know the total number of people kicked out is 50. We can set up the equation to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons. Let \( x \) be the number of people kicked out for other reasons. The total number of people kicked out is the sum of those kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, physical violence, and other reasons:
   \[
   3 + 7 + 21 + x = 50
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   31 + x = 50
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 50 - 31 = 19

"To calculate the monthly payment Karan has to make, we need to consider the interest on the loan and the total amount to be repaid over the five months.

First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan:
\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 152.085 \]

Now, let's add the interest to the principal to get the total amount to be repaid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.085 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3802.085 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month for five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.085}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.417 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month."

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos.

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

The total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

"First, let's calculate the total amount of lemonade Millie can make. She can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Millie spent $18 on supplies. So, the total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Since Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour, and she sells all the lemonade, we can determine the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. First, we find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we calculate the profit per hour:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \$2 \]"
"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther initially had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"First, let's determine the number of girls in the choir. Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 52 \times 0.5 = 26 \]

The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are scheduled to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

\[ \text{Girls who can't make it} = 26 \times 0.5 = 13 \]

So, the number of girls who can perform is:

\[ \text{Girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13 \]

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so we add the teachers to the number of girls who can perform:

\[ \text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money David saves, let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets.
- Each ticket costs $2.
- Therefore, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = $4\).
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = $36\).

Now, let's calculate the cost for David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the total cost Dasha would have paid:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- Therefore, David saves \(36 - 30 = $6\).

"To solve this problem, we can use the given ratio and the total number of popsicles to find out how many popsicles each person has.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(5x\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(6x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of popsicles is the sum of Betty's and Sam's popsicles:
\[5x + 6x = 165\]
\[11x = 165\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 11:
\[x = \frac{165}{11} = 15\]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \(5x = 5 \times 15 = 75\) popsicles.
- Sam has \(6x = 6 \times 15 = 90\) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[90 - 75 = 15\]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's calculate the cost of the streaming services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a 20% discount for bundling, the cost per service is reduced by 20%.

The discount for each service is:
\[ 10 \times 0.20 = 2 \]

So, the discounted cost for each service is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \]

Since he gets both Hulu and Disney Plus, the total cost for these two services is:
\[ 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Adding the cost of Netflix, the total cost for the streaming services is:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Now, let's calculate the savings by comparing the cost of the streaming services to the cost of the cable package:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

"First, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on each activity:

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is 90 / 60 = 1.5 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent:

Total time = 4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total time spent editing:

Percentage spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total time) * 100
                         = (1.5 / 7.5) * 100
                         = 0.2 * 100

"Mel originally uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, which means he uses 900 watts per hour. If he reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will only use it for 3 hours a day.

First, let's calculate the energy used per day before and after the reduction:

- Original daily energy usage: \( 8 \, \text{hours} \times 900 \, \text{watts} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \)
- Reduced daily energy usage: \( 3 \, \text{hours} \times 900 \, \text{watts} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \)

Now, let's find the daily savings in energy usage:

- Daily savings: \( 7200 \, \text{watts} - 2700 \, \text{watts} = 4500 \, \text{watts} \)

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the daily savings to kilowatts:

- Daily savings in kilowatts: \( \frac{4500 \, \text{watts}}{1000} = 4.5 \, \text{kW} \)

Finally, to find the total savings over 30 days:

- Total savings in 30 days: \( 4.5 \, \text{kW} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kW} \)

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. However, the information provided does not specify the percentage of candles that explode. We only know that 5% of the more dangerous candles (which are already 99% guaranteed not to explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Let's break it down:

1. **Candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that smells like wet dog:**
   - 5% of the candles are more dangerous and have this defect.
   - If Marcy makes 50,000 candles, the number of candles that are more dangerous and have a defect that smells like wet dog is \(50,000 \times 0.05 = 2,500\).

2. **Candles that both smell like wet dog and explode:**
   - Since the candles that smell like wet dog are already 99% guaranteed not to explode, only 1% of these candles will explode.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Joanne gathers an unknown number of apples from the average trees, which we'll call \(x\).

Joanne's total apples are \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees.

Joanne's sister's total apples are \(60 + 45 + 0 = 105\).

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can set up the equation:

\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[150 + x = 500\]

Subtract 150 from both sides to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 500 - 150\]

"Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180, which means \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, which means \( 2c + d = 304 \) because camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump.

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, we can express \( d \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 180 - c \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \]
\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \]
\[ c + 180 = 304 \]
\[ c = 304 - 180 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the equation \( d = 180 - c \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \, \text{km/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{km} \]

Adding all these distances together, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 800 \, \text{km} + 240 \, \text{km} + 0 \, \text{km} + 2100 \, \text{km} = 3140 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ 3140 \, \text{km} \]"
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4:

\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker size by 2:

\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches big."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from an elevation of 10,000 feet, so the comb is now at an elevation of:

10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb:

6,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 3,000 feet

Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb."
"Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank and twice that amount from the second bank, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:

$5000 (initial capital) + $4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) = $17000

Final capital: $17000"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.

Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, so they carried away a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats.

After the boats took away the cats, there were \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats left on the rock.

Then, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Final answer: 12 cats were left on the rock."
"Let's break down the cost month by month:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month.
2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month.
3. For the remaining 8 months (since 2 years is 24 months in total), the cost is $14 per month.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

1. Cost for the first 6 months: \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars
2. Cost for the next 8 months: \(8 \times 12 = 96\) dollars
3. Cost for the last 8 months: \(8 \times 14 = 112\) dollars

Adding these up gives us the total cost for 2 years:

\(48 + 96 + 112 = 256\) dollars

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **256 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.
4. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let's denote the original price of the jogger jeans as \( J \) and the original price of the tattered jeans as \( T \). We know \( T = 28 \) and \( J = 22 \).

The savings on the jogger jeans is \( J - 22 \) and the savings on the tattered jeans is \( T - 28 \).

According to the problem, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings, and the savings from the tattered jeans is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total savings.

So, we can write the following equations based on the savings:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = J - 22 \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 28 - T \]

Simplifying these equations:
\[ 2 = J - 22 \]
\[ 4 = 28 - 28 \]

From the first equation:
\[ J = 22 + 2 = 24 \]

From the second equation, we already know \( T = 28 \), so it confirms the savings.

The original price of the jogger jeans is $24, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in the original prices is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.

- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each: \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each: \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Now, we add up the capacities:

\(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\)

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones, so the feeders she made attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted by each type of feeder:

- For the 3 store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds

Adding these together, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day."
"Let's break down the costs:

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. So, the cost of the soup is \(4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = $5\).
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so it costs \( \frac{4}{2} = $2\).

Now, let's add up the costs:

- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost: \(4 + 5 + 2 = $11\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kenny needs $100 to buy a ticket to the amusement park.
2. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
3. He keeps 1/3 of the cards and has $50 in spending cash after selling the rest.

Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

- He keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
- The money he gets from selling \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards is \( 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = x \).

After selling the cards, he has $100 for the ticket and $50 in spending cash, which totals $150. Therefore, the money he gets from selling the cards is $150.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x = 150 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 150 cards.

Final numerical answer:
150"
"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hot dogs. That means 18 guests would get two hot dogs, and the other 18 would get one hot dog each.

So, the total number of hot dogs prepared would be:
\[ 18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hot dogs} \]

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. This means that the first hot dog for each of the 40 guests was provided, and they all wanted a second one. So, they would need an additional 40 hot dogs.

The total number of hot dogs required for 40 guests, each having two hot dogs, would be:
\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Since only 54 hot dogs were prepared, the number of guests who did not get a second hot dog is:
\[ 40 - (80 - 54) = 40 - 26 = 14 \]

So, 14 guests did not get a second hot dog."
"Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Therefore, the total number of letters in both names is 6 (Indras) + 7 (sister) = 13 letters.

"To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we first need to calculate the total cost before the discount and then apply the 20% discount.

1. Calculate the cost of the pot and pans: $120.00
2. Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls: $20.00
3. Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils: 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these amounts to find the total cost before the discount:
$120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost:
20% of $165.00 = 0.20 * $165.00 = $33.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost:
$165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00."
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy.

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16, so the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \text{ dragons} \]

Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons."
"First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needs in gallons. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 8:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
3. He had 1% of his money left after the purchase.

First, calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money George had left after the purchase. Since he had 1% of his money left, we can calculate the remaining amount:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ dollars} = 0.01 \times 5 = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we can determine how much money George spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the chips and the remaining money from the total amount he spent:
\[ 5 - 1.20 - 0.05 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, we can find out how many candy bars George bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. So, he shared 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops with his friends.

56 oranges ÷ 8 people = 7 oranges per person.

Each person will get 7 oranges."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use. He doubles the recipe, so he needs 2 * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, the cost is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, the beef stock costs $2.00 per box, and he needs 2 boxes, so the total cost for beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

The total cost for the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

Therefore, the cost per serving is $2.00."
"If it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, then Bernadette's drive takes:

4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes

"First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area of the room to find the width. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{width} \]

\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.

Elizabeth's total beads:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * 20 = 20 beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * 20 = 40 beads
Total for Elizabeth: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth's total beads:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * 20 = 60 beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * 20 = 80 beads
Total for Margareth: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, let's find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters:
Difference: 140 - 60 = 80 beads

One sister has 80 more beads than the other.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.
2. He spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.

So, the temperature increase from baking is:
3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

Adding this to the initial temperature:
40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

3. Marcus then opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
30 minutes / 10 minutes = 3
3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so:

- Swim time for James = 40 minutes * (1 - 0.10) = 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so:

- Bike time for James = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Let's denote the time James took for the run as \( R \) minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's:

- Total time for James = 170 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we can set up the equation for James's total time:

\[ 36 + 85 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ 121 + R = 180 \]
\[ R = 180 - 121 \]
\[ R = 59 \]

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.

Final numerical answer:

"Movie C was 1.25 hours long. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:

80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long."
"First, let's determine how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).

30 minutes is half an hour, so the distance the horse runs is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how much hay the horse eats. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the hay. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars} \]"
"Rozanne starts with 4 dozen eggs and 2 additional eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen eggs equal 48 eggs. Adding the 2 additional eggs, she has a total of 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. Therefore, the total number of glasses of eggnog she can make is 50 eggs divided by 5 eggs per glass, which equals 10 glasses.

Since each tray holds 5 glasses, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is the total number of glasses divided by the number of glasses per tray. So, 10 glasses divided by 5 glasses per tray equals 2 trays.

Final numerical answer:
2 trays"

"To calculate the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per sneaker.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale.
3. Calculate the total revenue from the department store.
4. Calculate the total revenue.
5. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost per sneaker:

1. The total cost for the case of sneakers is $576, and there are 48 sneakers in the case. So, the cost per sneaker is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale. So, the revenue from the flash sale is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The remaining sneakers are \(48 - 17 = 31\). These were sold to a department store at $25 each. So, the revenue from the department store is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the department store:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The total cost is the cost of the entire case, which is $576. So, the profit is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is:
\[
\boxed{539}

"Let's break down the costs:

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost with super ticket: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: $x (unknown regular price)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost without super ticket: $12 + $x + $3 = $15 + $x

According to the problem, you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.

So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 21 = 15 + x + 2 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 21 = 17 + x \]
\[ x = 21 - 17 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.
2. Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.
3. Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of filling one helium balloon on the first day.**

The total cost of filling 20 balloons on the first day was $900. Therefore, the cost of filling one balloon is:
\[ \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost of filling one helium balloon after the price increase.**

The cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price.**

The total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65 = 11050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the car's average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

1. Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours: \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\)
2. Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour: \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\)

Total distance traveled: \(120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}\)

Total time taken: \(2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}\)

Average speed: \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}\)

8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires

The value of the remaining sapphires:
5 sapphires * $800/sapphire = $4000

She receives 2 rubies in the trade, and the value of those rubies is:
2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $2400

Now, let's add the value of the remaining sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of her jewels:
$4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (rubies) = $6400

The total value of all her jewels is:
$6400"
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. 

In 30 days, Marin will eat:
4 apples/day * 30 days = 120 apples

"First, we need to calculate the volume of one raised bed. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the raised bed) is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, so the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920."
"First, let's calculate the number of green cards. Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as follows:

Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + 0.60 * 15
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Next, we calculate the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78."
"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies join, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.

So, the total number of fairies became \( 50 + 25 = 75 \).

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Therefore, the remaining number of fairies is \( 75 - 30 = 45 \).

**45**"
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7

Now, to find the percentage of puppies with spots, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots."
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying.

1. **Hay:**
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Carrots:**
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes:**
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

Now, we add up all the weights to get the total weight of the feed:
- Total weight = 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) + 48 (carrots) + 2 (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since you can't make a fraction of a trip):

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles three aluminum cans and five plastic bottles each week.

For the aluminum cans:
3 cans/week * 2 cents/can = 6 cents/week

For the plastic bottles:
5 bottles/week * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents/week

Total earnings per week:
6 cents/week (from cans) + 15 cents/week (from bottles) = 21 cents/week

For a four-week month:
21 cents/week * 4 weeks = 84 cents

Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"First, let's find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants, we can calculate the number of plants Toni has as follows:

\[ \text{Toni's plants} = \text{Frederick's plants} + 60\% \times \text{Frederick's plants} \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Toni's plants} = 16 \]

Now, we know that Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we can calculate the number of plants Shondra has as follows:

\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $50.

So, Ali originally had $21 and received an additional $50 from Leila.

$21 + $50 = $71

Ali now has $71."
"To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we first need to calculate the tip amount, which is 1/5 of the order cost, and then add it to the order cost.

The order cost is $15.

The tip amount is 1/5 of $15:
\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

Now, we add the tip to the order cost to get the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Order Cost} + \text{Tip} = 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18."
"Let's break down Finley's position changes step by step:

1. She started in 1st place.
2. She fell back 5 spots: \(1 - 5 = -4\). Since she can't be in a negative spot, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 1st place (since there's no position lower than 1st).
3. She then moved ahead 2 spots: \(1 + 2 = 3\). So, she's now in 3rd place.
4. She fell behind 3 spots: \(3 - 3 = 0\). Again, since there's no position 0, we adjust this to the last possible position, which is 1st place.
5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot: \(1 + 1 = 2\). So, she's now in 2nd place.

Therefore, Finley finished the race in 2nd place.

"Miss Maria has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, and 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. 

First, we calculate the total number of basketball cards:
\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Now, we add the total number of basketball and baseball cards:
\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so we subtract those from the total:
\[ 350 \text{ cards} - 50 \text{ cards} = 300 \text{ cards} \]

She gives the remaining 300 cards to her students, and each student gets 10 cards. To find out how many students she has, we divide the remaining cards by the number of cards each student gets:
\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students."
"First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After receiving a $1 discount, Becky paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on her total purchase. The discount amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, after the discount, Kelly paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky."
"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. Each room has 2 sheets.
2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so each room has \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum up the total number of laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total laundry items per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\)

For 80 rooms, the total number of laundry items is:
\(15 \times 80 = 1200\)

Final numerical answer:
1200"
"Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. 

- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, which is 5 * 2 = 10 shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes.
- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.
- On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.

Let's calculate the total number of shoes he has by the end of Saturday:

Starting shoes: 200
+ Monday's shoes: 10
+ Wednesday's shoes: 30
+ Friday's shoes: 60
- Saturday's shoes: 180

200 + 10 + 30 + 60 - 180 = 120

"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:

6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

Each pan holds 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans worth of cupcakes she should bake, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes."
"First, let's determine the cost of the piece of paper. The pen costs $2, and the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is:
3 * $2 = $6

The piece of paper costs $1 less than this amount, so:
$6 - $1 = $5

Now, let's add the cost of the pen and the paper to find the total cost:
$2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7

Theo gave the cashier $10, so the change she received is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in the class.
   - Each student started with 10 pencils.
   - Total initial pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 = 60 pencils.
   - Remaining pencils = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils.

3. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 = 80 pencils.

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know that Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 6 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

First, let's define the sets:
- Let \( D \) be the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- Let \( P \) be the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)
- Total number of kids in the class, \( |U| = 32 \)

We need to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances, which is \( |D \cup P| \).

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances.

To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one substance from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = |U| - |D \cup P| \]
\[ \text{Number of kids not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

"The plane tickets cost $5000 each, so for both Tom and his wife, the cost is:

\[ 2 \times \$5000 = \$10000 \]

The hotel is 20% more expensive than the normal price of $1500 per day. First, we calculate 20% of $1500:

\[ 0.20 \times \$1500 = \$300 \]

So, the increased price per day is:

\[ \$1500 + \$300 = \$1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:

\[ 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel together, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \$10000 + \$5400 = \$15400 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \$15400 \]"

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for one horse:**
   - Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one horse is \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Calculate the daily consumption of oats for all four horses:**
   - Since there are four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Calculate the total consumption of oats for five days:**
   - The total consumption over five days is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Determine the number of 50-pound bags needed:**
   - Since one bag contains 50 pounds of oats, the number of bags needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags}\).

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"Heather buys 2 packs of razors, and each pack contains 4 razors. The original price of one pack is $4.00. With the ""buy one get one free"" sale, she only pays for one pack but gets two. So, the cost for 2 packs is the same as the cost of 1 pack, which is $4.00.

She has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract that from the $4.00:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

This $2.00 is the total cost for 8 razors (2 packs with 4 razors each).

To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:

$2.00 / 8 = $0.25

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:

$0.25 = 25 cents

Each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount."

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. At that time, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

So, in four years, Angela will be \(3 \times 14 = 42\) years old.

If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, then her current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. 

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

For the morning rides over 14 days, the cost is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$6 \text{ per ride} = \$84 \]

For the afternoon rides over 14 days, the cost is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times \$2 \text{ per ride} = \$28 \]

Adding the costs of the morning and afternoon rides together:
\[ \$84 + \$28 = \$112 \]

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks."
"Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so Ashley brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges.

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

Together, Ashley and Brianne brought \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges.

Since one Greek orange pie needs three oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(120 \div 3 = 40\).

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies."
"To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set up an equation for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests, \( x \).

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, which includes food. So the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25x \]

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), where these two costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \), the number of insects Bodhi found as \( B \), and the number of insects Lily found as \( L \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the third equation:
\[ B = 2D \]

Next, we substitute \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) into the first equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, Lily found \( 16 \) insects.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, and her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.

"The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, and the chair is 3 feet wide. So, the width of the rug is:

3 feet (width of the chair) + 5 feet = 8 feet (width of the rug)

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, we calculate twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:

2 * 8 feet (width of the rug) + 2 feet = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet

Therefore, the couch is 18 feet long."
"Let's break down the information given:

3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought one small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.
5. She paid $7 in all.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost can be represented as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given that Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

pieces of 2 x 4 wood.

Since each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, the total number of sticks he can make is:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:

1200"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$144.00 \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week, so she takes a total of:

2 trips/day * 5 days/week = 10 trips/week

If each bus trip costs her $2.20, then the total cost for her bus trips in a week would be:

10 trips/week * $2.20/trip = $22.00/week

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save:

$22.00/week - $20.00/week = $2.00/week

Final numerical answer:

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. 

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, but the farm does not have any cows, so this statement is irrelevant to the farm's count.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does, but the farm does not have any sheep, so this statement is also irrelevant to the farm's count.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has 20 sheep.

Total number of animals = 30 cows + 20 sheep = 50 animals.

The farm and zoo have a combined total of 50 animals."

"To calculate the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
2. Determine the number of days Andy has to achieve this goal.
3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories to burn**

Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. and needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb. Therefore, the total number of calories he needs to burn is:
\[ 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of days**

Today is December 31st, and Andy's birthday is July 19th. The number of days from December 31st to July 19th is:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July (up to July 19th): 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 \text{ days} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit**

To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total number of calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

- Total water needed = 2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water."
"Julie initially had $500.

First, she spent 20% of $500 on clothes:
20% of $500 = 0.20 * $500 = $100

After buying clothes, she had:
$500 - $100 = $400

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
25% of $400 = 0.25 * $400 = $100

After buying CDs, she had:
$400 - $100 = $300

So, Julie had $300 left."
"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can write:
\[ H = 3L \]

The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, we can find the cost of the house by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house cost is $90,000."

\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has:

- Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from the $10 bills is \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali has six $20 bills, so the total from the $20 bills is \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of this total to his sister:

- Half of $160 is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.

So, after giving half to his sister, Ali has \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars left.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:

- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80 is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48\) dollars.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars left.

The amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."

"Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks:
6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks:
2 * 5 = 10 quarts per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy, so Ricky picks:
10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

To find the total number of quarts picked per hour by all four, we add their individual rates:
6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."

3. Calculate the weekly electric consumption before and after adding the new device.
4. Calculate the weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device.
5. Find the difference between the two weekly electric bills.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. Ada's current daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
2. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total daily consumption after adding the new device will be:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h}
   \]
3. The weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is:
   \[
   12 \text{ kW/h} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 2016 \text{ kW/week}

"First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we can calculate the number of days it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people working together would be 5 times as fast as one person, it would take them 10 days / 5 = 2 days to paint a whole house.

To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so:

2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house."
"Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

"To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of the headphone set.
2. Calculate how much money Tom would have left if he didn't buy the headphone set.
3. Calculate how many CDs he could buy with the remaining money.

First, we know that Tom paid $48 in total and that the CD costs $4. Let's denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 4 + H = 48 \]

Solving for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had:
\[ 48 - 44 = 4 \]

This remaining $4 is exactly the cost of one CD. Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80

"Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so currently, he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60.

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Currently, Jame's cousin will be 55 - 8 = 47 years old.

The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer cost $1,100.
- The printer cost $400 less than the computer.

First, let's find the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, printer, and 2 monitors is $2,400. We can set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ \text{Cost of the computer} + \text{Cost of the printer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 700 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides to isolate the term with the cost of one monitor:
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

"To calculate how much you end up paying, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total bill including the tip.
2. Split the total bill evenly between you and your wife.

First, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 20% of the $50 dinner bill:

\[ \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the total bill including the tip is:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Since you want to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill, you will pay your share of the total bill, which is half of $60:

\[ \text{Your share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, each boy gets $6 initially.

2. The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   So, he now has $11.

3. The following day, he adds another $10 to his share:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   So, he now has $21.

4. He then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13
   \]
   So, he now has $13.

5. He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39
   \]
   So, he now has $39.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days in April**: April has 30 days.

2. **Divide the month into two halves**: The first half of April has 15 days, and the second half also has 15 days.

3. **Define the daily savings for the first half**: Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half of April. Therefore, his total savings for the first half of April would be \( 15x \).

4. **Define the daily savings for the second half**: According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half. So, he will save \( 2x \) dollars each day in the second half of April. Therefore, his total savings for the second half of April would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total savings**: Elvis's total savings for the month of April should be $1125. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

7. **Find the daily savings for the second half**: Since \( x = 25 \), the daily savings for the second half of April is \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of toys in a sorted play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, the sorted play set would have:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set of 400 toys. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

"Bill started with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he initially has is:

2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to have 2 bottles of water for each guest. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many additional bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 additional bottles

So, Bill will need to buy 92 additional bottles of water."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. So, twice the time it takes him in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes. Adding 2 minutes to that, he takes \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we calculate the total time for 3 miles in both conditions:

- Cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- Warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for 10 hours, given that it starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

1. The initial angle of the sun from the ground is the same as the angle of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees.
2. The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
3. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\).

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid (32 degrees from the ground) and moves straight upward, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the initial angle plus the angle it has moved:

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).
2. In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( S + 7 \) and his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, at that time, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age. So we can write the equation:
\[ S + 7 = 3(N + 7) \]

Substituting \( S = 44 \) into the equation, we get:

Now, if Kate sells each muffin for $1.50, we can calculate the total amount of money she can make by multiplying the number of muffins by the price per muffin:

\[ 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost of the new carpet, the padding, the removal of the old carpet, and the installation of the new carpet. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the new carpet:**

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds per day = Total number of birds / Number of days
= 280 / 7
= 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
2. We need to add half of this starting value to itself: \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. Next, we divide this result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Then, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12: \(6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, which means his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off and then use that percentage to find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees.

1. Calculate the percentage by which the oven is off:
   \[
   \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual temperature} - \text{Set temperature}}{\text{Set temperature}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage off} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\%
   \]

2. Now, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve a temperature of 520 degrees. Let \( x \) be the temperature she should set her oven to. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   x \times (1 - 0.04) = 520
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.96 = 520
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{520}{0.96} = 541.67
   \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to approximately 541.67 degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the total time into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes gives:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the total minutes for both movies:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"Herb's house cost $76,000. 

If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the cost of Juan's house as follows:

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

2. Subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to find the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

The value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy brought, which means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

The total number of cups brought by both Judy and her friend is 12 + 40 = 52 cups.

The total number of dishes brought by both is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 52 + 68 = 120.

"First, let's determine the cost of one box of contacts with the discount applied. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

The cost per contact when buying 2 boxes is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts (assuming ""pair"" refers to a single use contact) is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours worked by John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the total earnings for both John and Jill:
- Tabitha pays $10 per hour.
- Jill's total earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's total earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"First, let's calculate the total calories Hannah burns from aerobics and running.

For aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

For running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink:

Total water needed (in ml) = (Total calories burned / 200) * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = (1600 / 200) * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 8 * 100
Total water needed (in ml) = 800 ml

Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the note on the jar:
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, which is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to determine the three typing speeds:

1. Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
2. After lessons: 52 WPM
3. After further increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Now, we add these three speeds together and divide by 3 to find the average:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} \]

\[ \text{Average} = 52 \]

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM."
"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we can calculate the weight change for each option and then find the difference.

1. **Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week: 1.25 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}\)

2. **Donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds
   - Over 5 weeks: \(1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}\)

3. **Difference in weight:**
   - Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
   - Weight loss from Cheerios: -6.25 pounds
   - Difference: \(8.75 \text{ pounds} - (-6.25 \text{ pounds}) = 8.75 \text{ pounds} + 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 15 \text{ pounds}\)

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts and Cheerios for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we need to account for all the people who will be attending the event.

1. Alex initially invites 100 people via email.
2. Each of these 100 people will also invite 2 friends. So, the number of additional people invited by email invites is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).
3. Alex also calls 10 of her friends and invites them. So, there are 10 more people invited this way.
4. Out of these 10 friends, 8 will bring their spouses. So, there are 8 additional people (spouses) coming.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

- Initial email invites: 100
- Additional people from email invites: 200
- Friends invited by phone: 10
- Spouses: 8

Total number of seats needed = \(100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 318\)

"To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
2. Calculate the weekly protein intake based on daily consumption.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein. Therefore, 200 grams (which is double the amount) would contain double the protein:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms each day.

Next, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein/week} \]

Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:

\[ -J = -10 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is $2000 each, so:
   \[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \]

2. For one of the implants, there is an extra cost for a porcelain crown, which is $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
   \[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \]

3. George has already put down a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \]

4. George makes $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
   \[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work."
"Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so that angle is \( 3x \) degrees.

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Dividing both sides by 6, we find:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees and \( 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. Here's the breakdown:

- Colby has 8 quarters, which are worth 25 cents each, but we only need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 quarter = 5 nickels, 8 quarters = 8 * 5 = 40 nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes, which are worth 10 cents each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 dime = 2 nickels, 6 dimes = 6 * 2 = 12 nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which are already in the form we need.
- Colby has 15 pennies, which are worth 1 cent each, but we need to convert them to nickels. Since 1 nickel = 5 pennies, 15 pennies = 15 / 5 = 3 nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
40 (from quarters) + 12 (from dimes) + 14 (from nickels) + 3 (from pennies) = 69 nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has:

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Adding these together gives us the total number of legs:

20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

Then, the weight turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is two pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Games on Birthday**: Steve gets 5 games on his birthday.
2. **Games Bought in the First Year**: He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.
3. **Games Bought in the Second Year**: He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.
4. **Games Bought in the Third Year**: He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.
5. **Games Received for Christmas**: He gets 5 games every year for 3 years, so he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add all these up:

- Initial games: 5
- Games from the first year: 12
- Games from the second year: 24
- Games from the third year: 48
- Games from Christmas: 15

"First, let's determine how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds in two hours, he can make:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each of them can make in 12 hours.

For Ruiz:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

For Marissa:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to find the total amount of chocolates they made together:
\[ 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

- On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the money Howard spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \]

Howard originally had $100. So, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \]

Therefore, Howard has $12 left."
"To calculate the total money Patrick earned, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

For the first four hours:
- He sold 15 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.
- So, in one hour, he earned \(15 \times 0.50 = 7.50\) dollars.
- Over four hours, he earned \(4 \times 7.50 = 30\) dollars.

For the next two hours:
- He sold 10 cups per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.
- So, in one hour, he earned \(10 \times 0.60 = 6.00\) dollars.
- Over two hours, he earned \(2 \times 6.00 = 12\) dollars.

Adding the earnings from both parts:
- Total earnings = \(30 + 12 = 42\) dollars.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of 42 dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.
2. Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per tire for Jeremy's monthly driving.**

Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Therefore, the number of rotations per mile is:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

For 400 miles, the total number of rotations is:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations per tire over a year.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of rotations per tire in a year is:
\[ 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations.**

To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of washings per pump.
2. Determine the cost per washing.
3. Calculate the cost per pump.

First, we know that 2 pumps of shampoo give 120 washings. Therefore, 1 pump would give half of that number of washings:

\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out the cost per washing. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, which is 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 20 \text{ cents per washing} \]

Now, since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost per pump is:

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 20 \text{ cents per washing} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"First, let's calculate the discount on the items Joe wants to buy.

The shirt costs $25 and there is a 30% discount on it. So, the discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

The discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned for them, so the price of the shorts remains $35.

Now, let's add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50 to spend, but the total cost of the outfit is $52.50. Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford to buy both items. However, if we assume the question is asking hypothetically or there's a mistake in the given values, we can still calculate how much he would be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

But since the question asks for the remaining money, and Joe would not have any money left and would be short by $2.50, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{-2.50} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
2. Determine the amount of butter needed for the total number of dozens of croissants.

First, Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Next, we know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street.

The cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100 \]

The cost to repave Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Cost} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060 \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference} = \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \]

Therefore, it costs \(\boxed{65960}\) more to repave Lewis' street."
"John initially gets funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months. The research ends up taking 10 times that long, so it takes 50 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000, and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.

Let's calculate the cost for the remaining 45 months:

- For the 6th month, the cost is $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000.
- For the 7th month, the cost is $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000.
- For the 8th month, the cost is $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500.
- And so on...

The cost for each month forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a = 150,000\) and the common ratio \(r = 1.5\).

The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \]
where \(n\) is the number of terms.

In this case, we have 45 terms (months 6 to 50), so:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - 1.5^{45}}{1 - 1.5} \]

First, calculate \(1.5^{45}\):
\[ 1.5^{45} \approx 1,188,137,744.7 \]

Now, substitute this value into the formula:
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{1 - 1,188,137,744.7}{1 - 1.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \frac{-1,188,137,743.7}{-0.5} \]
\[ S_{45} = 150,000 \times 2,376,275,487.4 \]
\[ S_{45} \approx 356,441,323,110 \]

Now, add the initial 5 months of funding:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100,000 + 356,441,323,110 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} \approx 356,441,423,110 \]

So, the total cost of John's research is approximately $356,441,423,110."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so that's 8 ounces.
The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Adding these together:

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat."
"To find the total number of posts in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in March.
2. Calculate the total number of posts per day for the entire group.
3. Multiply the daily total by the number of days in March.

March typically has 31 days.

Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, and there are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts per day for the group is:

\[ 1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day} \]

Now, to find the total number of posts in March:

\[ 3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is:

"Gary does laundry twice a week, so in a year (52 weeks), he does laundry:

\[ 2 \text{ times/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ times/year} \]

Each load uses 20 gallons of water, so for 104 loads, he uses:

\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

A gallon of water costs $0.15, so for 2080 gallons, he spends:

\[ 2080 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} = \$312 \]

Therefore, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"To find out how much Scarlett spent, let's break down the costs:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each = 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish: 20 at $0.50 each = 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these costs together:

$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 3 inches * 2 = 6 inches tall.

The remaining seats after the administrators are seated:

72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents:

54 seats * 1/3 = 18 seats occupied by parents

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students:

54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats occupied by students

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is:

"Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:

\[ 4 \text{ lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:

\[ 24 \text{ lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ lights} \]

If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is:

\[ 96 \text{ lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning lights} = 76 \text{ functioning lights} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces of gum at school.
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces.
4. After these chews, he has \( 20 - 4 - 1 - 1 = 14 \) pieces of gum left.
5. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) pieces.

"To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s
Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h
There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h} = 72 \text{ Mb/h} \]

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Now, convert the height difference from feet to inches:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, so we need to find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches:
\[ 8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.

"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Determine the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[ \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[ \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, let's find the price of the gold jewel:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \]

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

Now, let's find the total price for all three jewels:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between himself and Bob. 

Bob is driving at 55 mph, and Tom is driving at 70 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:

75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to first calculate the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The total cost of the classes is $60, so the cost per class is given by:

\[
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
\]

We need this cost to be less than or equal to $10:

\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):

\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:

\[
60 - 100 \leq -10x
\]

\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10, and remember to reverse the inequality sign:

\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, \( x \leq 4 \). This means Manny can miss up to 4 classes and still have the cost per class be $10 or less. If he misses 5 or more classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

2. Calculate the cost of one orange:
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange is $3.30 ÷ 3 = $1.10.

3. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The cost for 5 apples is 5 × $1.30 = $6.50.
   - The cost for 5 oranges is 5 × $1.10 = $5.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) is given by the formula:

"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20,000 + (0.05 \times \$20,000) = \$20,000 + \$1,000 = \$21,000 \]

Next, we add the bonus worth half a month's salary to his new monthly salary:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21,000 + \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$21,000\right) = \$21,000 + \$10,500 = \$31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much money Tim will make in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with the bonus by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$31,500 \times 12 = \$378,000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$378,000\) in a year."

For Alisa:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours
Distance = 54 miles

For Stanley:
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours
Distance = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to get the total miles biked:

"Bill can dig 4 feet per hour through soil. For the 24 feet of soil, it will take him:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

He digs through clay at half the speed, so his rate through clay is:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

For the 8 feet of clay, it will take him:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time for soil and clay together:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the number of cupcakes each person will get.

1. Howie is buying cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. This makes a total of 27 people (1 + 1 + 25).
2. Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate).

So, the total number of cupcakes is calculated by multiplying the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person will get:

\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her photo.
2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after three weeks is \(2000 \times 70 = 140000\).
3. Recently, she received 20000 more new likes.

To find the total number of likes, we add the initial likes, the likes after three weeks, and the recent likes:

\[2000 + 140000 + 20000 = 162000\]

So, the total number of Instagram likes is 162000."
"Let's break down the calculations step by step.

**Clara's Purchase:**
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- Total cost before the voucher: \(20 \times 20 = 400\) dollars.
- Clara got a $2 discount.
- Final cost for Clara: \(400 - 2 = 398\) dollars.

**Sheila's Purchase:**
- The next day, the price shot to $30 per pomegranate.
- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each.
- Total cost before the discount: \(20 \times 30 = 600\) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- Discount amount: \(600 \times 0.10 = 60\) dollars.
- Final cost for Sheila: \(600 - 60 = 540\) dollars.

**Difference in Final Prices:**
- Difference between the final prices paid: \(540 - 398 = 142\) dollars.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is **142 dollars**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
2. The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month. Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total sales in the first month were the sum of the sales from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the sales in the second month were $1200 * 3/4 = $900.
5. The total sales over the two months would be the sum of the sales from the first and second months, which is $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Final numerical answer:
2100"
"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first paid hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so the second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30, and the third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost for all the paid hours:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

So, James paid $105."

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**
   - Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Total deviled egg halves needed = 3 halves/guest * 16 guests = 48 halves.

2. **Determine the number of whole eggs needed:**
   - 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - Total whole eggs needed = 48 halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.

3. **Convert the number of eggs to dozens:**
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs.
   - Total dozens of eggs needed = 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs."
"Shiela has already finished writing 1/3 of the 15-page research paper.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we first calculate how many pages she has already written:

1/3 of 15 pages = 15 * (1/3) = 5 pages

Now, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages required:

15 pages - 5 pages = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline (30 days - 20 days = 10 days)."
"To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. Initial cost of the plane: $150,000
2. Monthly hanger rental cost: $5,000
3. Monthly fuel cost: $5,000 * 2 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for hanger and fuel:
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

For the first year, there are 12 months, so the total cost for hanger and fuel for the year is:
$15,000 * 12 = $180,000

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly cost of hanger and fuel:
$150,000 (plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000

The total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000."
"If it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then it took her:

30 minutes (rice) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes (pork)

The combined cooking time for pork and rice is:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) = 80 minutes

Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took her:

80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes (beans)

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans:

30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

120 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/2 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the first mixture: \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):

- Cost of 1/5 pound almonds: \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars
- Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars
- Total cost of the second mixture: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:

- Difference in cost: \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars

Therefore, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's denote the number of sheep as \( S \) and the number of geese as \( G \).

Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, while geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve for \( S \) and \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

"Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

Let's calculate the total cost of the items we know:

- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars
- 1 bucket of fried chicken: $8.00
- 1 bottle of soda: $1.00

Adding these up: \(4 + 8 + 1 = 13\) dollars

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, we can find the cost of the apple pie by subtracting the total cost of the known items from the total amount spent:

\(20 - 13 = 7\) dollars

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"Given that Aurelia has $120, we can determine how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

Next, we know that Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy. Therefore, Rayna's money is:

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Now, we add the money of Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna together:

\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \]

So, each person would have \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"The game originally consists of 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is:

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the total height increase needed for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
3. Determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow the required additional height.

Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches.
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- Current height = 20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total height increase needed.
- Target height = 600 inches
- Current height = 240 inches
- Height increase needed = 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches

Step 3: Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.
- Growth rate = 30 inches per day
- Days required = Height increase needed / Growth rate = 360 inches / 30 inches per day = 12 days

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are now 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs. Therefore, James needs to buy 8 more toys, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as when he left, so the number of dogs is now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. James needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys, bringing the total to 12 + 12 = 24 toys.
4. When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so the number of dogs is now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. Since the number of dogs has changed, James needs 21 - 24 = -3 toys, but since he can't have a negative number of toys, he still has 24 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 24.

"To find out by how much the group will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we first need to calculate the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

The weight of one adult is 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of 8 adults is:
\[ 80 \, \text{kg/adult} \times 8 \, \text{adults} = 640 \, \text{kg} \]

Adding Jack's weight to this total:
\[ 640 \, \text{kg} + 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much the group will exceed this limit, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the group will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg."
"Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can work backwards to find out how many cookies Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, to find the total number of cookies they have, we add up the cookies each one has:

Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies."
"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which means the length is increased by \( 0.5x \) cm. Additionally, she adds 20 cm of lace trim to the bottom. Therefore, the final length of the dress is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is:
  \[
  \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}
  \]

Now, we need to find the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{2} \times 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Finally, we add the times for both modes to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

"Let's denote the age of the younger triplet as \( x \). Therefore, the age of the older triplet would be \( x + 7 \) since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

Since there is one set of twins, the age of each twin would be the same as the age of the older triplet, which is \( x + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are given as 44. So, we can write the equation as:

\[ (x + 7) + (x + 7) + x + (x + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 4x + 28 = 44 \]

Subtract 28 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 16 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 4 \]

So, the younger triplet is 4 years old. The age of one of the twins, who is 7 years older than the younger triplet, is:

\[ x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old."
"John has a total of 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. Converting this to minutes, we get:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Now, let's add up the time John needs for his homework:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

Subtracting the time needed for homework from the total time before dinner:

180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes to nap.

"To find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Therefore, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Next, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Now, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, to find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of coins each person has saved over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's determine how many coins Rong saves in a month and then over ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (which is 120 months), Rong will save:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Next, let's calculate how many coins Neil saves in a month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \text{ coins} \right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil will save:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, we add the total savings of Rong and Neil over ten years to find the combined total:
\[ 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have after ten years is:
\[ 5760 \]"
"Let's break down the costs first:

1. The cost of the two vaccines is $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.
2. Let the cost of the heartworm check be \( x \).
3. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. So, \( x = 0.6 \times \text{total bill} \).

Let the total bill be \( T \). Then we have:
\[ x = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + x \]

Substituting \( x = 0.6T \) into the equation for \( T \):
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To solve for \( T \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Final numerical answer:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - Therefore, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

The price for such a crate of fruit is **32 dollars**."
"Let's break down the information given:

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. So, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Marta's points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class needs a minimum of 400 points to go on the trip. So, the points the class is missing is:

1. Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
2. Determine how many of those fireworks Hannah will see.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
4. Add the fireworks Hannah sees from the city display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. So, the total number of fireworks set off by the city is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300
   \]

2. Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks. So, the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city display is:

"First, let's determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys drinks and snacks for the seat. Each seat requires 2 drinks and 3 snacks. Since there are 20 seats, the total number of drinks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

And the total number of snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

And the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:

"Each female ate 3 dumplings. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

There are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.

The total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is the sum of the dumplings eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings."
"To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Gerald and Julia each received when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are 3 + 2 = 5 parts.

Each part is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

So, Gerald received 3 parts, which is 3 * $20 = $60.

Julia received 2 parts, which is 2 * $20 = $40.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he would have $60 - $10 = $50 left.

Therefore, Gerald had $50 left."
"The cat can run at a speed of 15 feet/second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds."
"To find out how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first need to determine how much more money they need to raise. 

The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. So, the remaining amount to be raised is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they raise per hour. They raised $2100 in the first 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, to find out how many more hours they need to fundraise to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours.

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage by the city to find the non-industrial usage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
So, the industrial usage is \(40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%\).

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage.
The total usage by the city is 40%, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the non-industrial usage is \(40\% - 32\% = 8\%\).

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

Therefore, Alex charges \(\$168\) for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"To determine the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then sum the amounts produced in the given time.

First, let's find the production rate for chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for chocolate ice cream is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, let's find the production rate for vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Therefore, the production rate for vanilla ice cream is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we calculate the total production in 48 hours for each type of ice cream:
- For chocolate ice cream: \( 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).
- For vanilla ice cream: \( 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Finally, we sum the total production of both types of ice cream:
- Total quarts produced in 48 hours = \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

Therefore, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
- Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
- Blueberry muffins: 13 muffins at $1.00 each = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Now, let's add up the total cost before the discount:

Total cost = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off, we need to calculate 10% of $50.00 and subtract it from the total:

10% of $50.00 = 0.10 * $50.00 = $5.00

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

Total bill after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 and each scoop costs $1.50. With the deal, for every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 scoop free. 

First, let's calculate how many scoops she can buy with her $6.00 without considering the deal:
\[ \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops} \]

Now, let's see how the deal works. For every 2 scoops she buys, she gets 1 free. So, if she buys 2 scoops, she gets 3 scoops in total. 

If she buys 4 scoops, she would get 2 free scoops (since 4 / 2 = 2), making a total of 6 scoops.

Therefore, Erin should buy 4 scoops to maximize her ice cream consumption with the deal.

"Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in two weeks (14 days), she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Both started with 100 pieces, so after two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's:

\[ 3 \text{ people} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 2 people in this group:
\[ 2 \text{ people} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:
\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, we subtract the slices eaten from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
18"
"The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, the time it takes for the dog to eat nine sausages is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time it takes for the cat and the dog and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( B \) inches.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
\[ 9B + 10 \]

We are also given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 8 feet and 4 inches is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9B + 10 = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 9B = 90 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 10 \]"
"To find out how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows she smashes for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the number of windows smashed for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools and then calculate the number of blue spools.

1. Calculate the total number of spools:
   - Light blue: 15
   - Dark blue: 45
   - Light green: 40
   - Dark green: 50

   Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

2. Calculate the number of blue spools:

"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. To find out how many pieces he will need for 30 days, we multiply the number of pieces he chews per day by the number of days:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Now, since a pack of gum contains 15 pieces, we divide the total number of pieces he needs by the number of pieces per pack to find out how many packs he will need:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of smores needed:**
   - **Kids:** 9 kids want 2 smores each, so \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
   - **Adults:** 6 adults want 1 smore each, so \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
   - **Total smores needed:** \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

2. **Calculate the number of smores that can be made from one box of graham crackers:**
   - Each sleeve makes 8 smores.
   - There are 3 sleeves in a box, so \(3 \times 8 = 24\) smores per box.

3. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**

1. **Initial Stickers and Buttons:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
   - A small sticker is worth one small button.
   - A large button is worth three small stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.
   - Each small button can be exchanged for a large button, so 27 small buttons = 27 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left and 40 + 27 = 67 large stickers.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 67 large stickers = 0.5 * 67 = 33.5, but since we can't have half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 33 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 33 large stickers = 33 large buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 67 - 33 = 34 large stickers left and 67 + 33 = 100 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 34 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons.
   - 34 large stickers = 34 * 3 = 102 small buttons.
   - After this trade, Lorraine has 102 small buttons.

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls. So, the total number of Pomeranians is \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

3. We also know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If the total number of Pomeranians is 18, then these 18 Pomeranians represent two thirds of Jana's total puppies. Let's denote the total number of Jana's puppies by \(P\). We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}P = 18
   \]
4. To find \(P\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
   \[
   P = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27
   \]

So, the total number of Jana's puppies is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Jayden initially had $70. Ava gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, the total amount Jayden has now is $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera."
"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{2}x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3.5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3.5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{3.5} = \frac{2500}{35} = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."
"Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spends:
3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spends:
5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each, so he spends:
1 head of lettuce * $3/head = $3

Together, they spend:
$6 (Leila) + $5 (Jack) + $3 (Chase) = $14

"George has 45% more pears than bananas. If George has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears he has as follows:

1. First, find 45% of 200 bananas:
\[ 45\% \times 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

2. Then, add this to the original number of bananas to find the number of pears:
\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \]

So, George has 290 pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:
\[ 200 \text{ bananas} + 290 \text{ pears} = 490 \text{ fruits} \]

Final numerical answer:
490"
"Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball, so she had $80 - $20 = $60 left. Each candy bar costs $5, so the number of candy bars she could buy is $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars.

"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 5 \, \text{kg/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3, so for 20 kilograms, Sam would have to spend:

\[ 20 \, \text{kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60 \]

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is:

300 + 150 = 450 books

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in that hour:

300 / 2 = 150 books

Altogether, they have read:

450 (Ezra) + 150 (Ahmed) = 600 books

"Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Let's calculate her earnings for each day first.

**Monday:**
- She teaches for 5 hours.
- Her base earnings for Monday are \(5 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$75\).
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are \( \$75 + \$5 = \$80 \).

**Wednesday:**
- She teaches for 2 hours.
- Her base earnings for Wednesday are \(2 \text{ hours} \times \$15/\text{hour} = \$30\).
- Since she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are \( \$30 \).

**Total Earnings:**
- Adding her earnings from both days, we get \( \$80 + \$30 = \$110 \).

Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching."
"The perfume company sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, which means they sold a total of \(5 \times 4 = 20\) vanilla scents.

They sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, which means they sold a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\) fruity scents.

To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:

\(20 - 16 = 4\)

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with the fruity scents.

"Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total revenue from the eggplants is:

20 eggplants * $3/eggplant = $60

To make a total of $135, the additional amount he needs from selling the corn is:

$135 - $60 = $75

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell, so the price per ear of corn should be:

$75 / 25 ears = $3/ear

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

$3/ear"
"Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which sums up to 12 hours in total for the weekend.

First, we subtract the time she spends reading:
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours remaining for video games and soccer.

Next, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is 1/3 of the remaining 9 hours:
1/3 * 9 hours = 3 hours playing video games.

Now, we subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours playing soccer.

To find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time spent on soccer by the total weekend time and multiply by 100:
(6 hours / 12 hours) * 100 = 50%.

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

50%"

"To find out how many wheels Henry will need to assemble all the toys, we can calculate the total number of wheels required for the cars and motorcycles separately and then add them together.

For the cars:
57 cars * 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles:
73 motorcycles * 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
228 wheels + 146 wheels = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies in total.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. The cost for the series is $6 each, so the total cost for the series is \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) movies.
5. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) movies are older movies.
6. The cost for the older movies is $5 each, so the total cost for the older movies is \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars.
7. The remaining movies are \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) movies, and these are normal movies.
8. The cost for the normal movies is $10 each, so the total cost for the normal movies is \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs:
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

The total cost is \( 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the Llesis family, which is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

1. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - They drove for \(6 - 1.5 = 4.5\) hours.
   - Their average driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance driven is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Calculate the hiking speed:**
   - Their hiking speed is \(5\) miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
   - Half of their driving speed is \(\frac{50}{2} = 25\) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, their hiking speed is \(25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.

3. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - They hiked for \(1.5\) hours.
   - Their hiking speed was \(20\) miles per hour.
   - Therefore, the distance hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

4. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked.
   - Therefore, the total distance is \(225 + 30 = 255\) miles.

"Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E_e \), the number of berries she collects as \( B_e \), and the time she finishes the level as \( T_e \) seconds. For Ava, we'll use \( E_a \), \( B_a \), and \( T_a \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)
- \( B_a = B_e + 3 \)
- \( T_a = T_e + 4 \)

The points are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{time left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_e = 10E_e + 5B_e + 30(T_e - T_e) = 10E_e + 5B_e \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_a + 5B_a + 30(T_e - (T_e + 4)) = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(B_e + 3) + 30(-4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 80 + 5B_e + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_a = 10E_e + 5B_e - 25 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = (10E_e + 5B_e - 25) - (10E_e + 5B_e) \]
\[ \text{Score}_a - \text{Score}_e = -25 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ -25 \]

The difference between their two scores is -25."
"The total cost for four pizzas is $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total. 

First, we find the total cost of the other two pizzas:
$64 (total cost) - $30 (cost of two pizzas) = $34 (cost of the other two pizzas).

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
$34 ÷ 2 = $17.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

Each of the other two pizzas cost $17."

"Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( O \) and the number of white fish as \( W \). Initially, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

Now that we have \( W = 4 \), we can find \( O \):

\[ O = 17 - W = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish. The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's determine the temperature during the night. If it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day, and the day temperature is 45 degrees, then the night temperature is:

45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Now, to prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees. Since the temperature drops to 12 degrees during the night, we need to calculate how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

The temperature needs to increase from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, which is a difference of:

32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Since each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed is:

20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"First, we need to determine the number of 9-person groups that can be formed from 90 people. We do this by dividing the total number of people by the size of each group:

   - If Billy works 20 hours, his total earnings are: \(20 \times 11.50 = 230\) dollars.

2. **Sally's Salary Calculation:**
   - Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her starting rate is $10.50 per hour.
   - If Sally works 20 hours, her total earnings are: \(20 \times 10.50 = 210\) dollars.

3. **Difference in Earnings:**
   - The difference in earnings between Billy and Sally is: \(230 - 210 = 20\) dollars.

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally."

"To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to consider both the students and the teachers' contributions.

1. **Students' Contribution:**
   - Each student plants 1 tree.
   - There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of students is \(40 \times 25 = 1000\).
   - So, the students will plant \(1000\) trees.

2. **Teachers' Contribution:**
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   - There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers.
   - Therefore, the total number of teachers is \(40 \times 3 = 120\).
   - So, the teachers will plant \(120 \times 2 = 240\) trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of trees planted is the sum of the trees planted by students and teachers.
   - Therefore, the total number of trees is \(1000 + 240 = 1240\).

"First, let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.30 \times (14 + x) = x \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[ 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 + 0.30x = x \]
\[ 4.2 = x - 0.30x \]
\[ 4.2 = 0.70x \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Final numerical answer:

"Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, the total hours played in the first period is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, which is 7 days. So, the total hours played in the second period is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours from both periods gives:

\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:

\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.

After 2 hours:
- The first car will have traveled \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).
- The second car will have traveled \(70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}\).

The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
\[140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles}\]

So, the two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours."
"To find out how much James paid for the ring, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
2. Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
3. Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the diamond and the gold.
The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
Total cost = $600 + $300 = $900

Step 2: Calculate the 30% premium on the total cost.
30% of $900 is calculated as:
0.30 * $900 = $270

Step 3: Add the premium to the total cost to get the final amount James paid.
Final amount = Total cost + Premium
Final amount = $900 + $270 = $1170

So, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"To find the overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students, then divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

- Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
- Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
- Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders, so it's \(2 \times \frac{40}{100} = \frac{80}{100} = 0.8\). Therefore, 400 fifth-graders had \(400 \times 0.8 = 320\) pass.

Now, let's sum up the total number of students who passed and the total number of students:

- Total students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 680\)
- Total students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

The overall pass rate is then:

\[
\frac{680}{1000} = 0.68
\]

Expressed as a percentage, the overall pass rate is 68%.

The final numerical answer is:

68%"
"Milo has two bags of glass chips, and each bag contains 72 chips. Therefore, the total number of glass chips he has is:

\[ 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we need to determine how many square inches he can cover with 144 chips, given that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch.

First, we calculate the total number of square inches he can cover with 144 chips:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips per square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Since the mosaic is three inches tall, we can find the length of the mosaic by dividing the total square inches by the height:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students.

1. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
   \[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

2. Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
   \[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we add the amounts of tea consumed by both groups of students:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

The total amount of tea left after the students drank is 10 quarts. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is the sum of the tea left and the tea consumed:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total amount of tea from quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 butterscotch candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered 100 more candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he has after the additional order and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

Total candies after the order: 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies
Candies sold: 150

Candies still to be sold: 200 (total) - 150 (sold) = 50 candies

Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies."
"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May.

- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310."
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25 \text{ per branch}} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420 \text{ branches}}{7 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals

3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals

Now, let's sum up all the petals before she drops any:
\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals

Rose drops 1 of each type of flower, so she drops:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

The total number of petals dropped is:
\(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals

Subtract the petals dropped from the total petals:
\(101 - 22 = 79\) petals

So, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

Starting with 35 marshmallows, after making the S'mores and dropping some, the number of marshmallows left is:
35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

With 14 marshmallows left, and assuming they want to make an equal number of S'mores, each kid can have:
14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Each kid can have 7 S'mores."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jack's Game Time:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack's total game time: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \).

2. **Friends' Game Times:**
   - Two friends can play half as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes} \) per quarter.
   - One friend can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \( 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \) per quarter.

3. **Total Game Time for Each Friend:**
   - Two friends play for 10 minutes each: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters} \) each.
   - One friend plays for 30 minutes: \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters} \).

4. **Total Quarters Used:**

"Let's denote the amount of citrus zest used as \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.

Let the amount of salt used be \( s \) ounces. Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.

The amount of oil used is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces.

According to the problem, the amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest, so \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can express all the ingredients in terms of \( z \):
- Citrus zest: \( z \) ounces
- Fragrance: \( z \) ounces
- Salt: \( 2z \) ounces
- Sugar: \( 2z \) ounces
- Oil: \( 2s = 2(2z) = 4z \) ounces

The total amount of the salt scrub is the sum of all these ingredients, which is 10 ounces:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Now, we can find the amount of oil:
\[ \text{Oil} = 4z = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

So, the amount of oil used is 4 ounces."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

So, the number of cards Becca has is:

Cindy had 27 eggs altogether."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund Milly will receive, then subtract the refund from the cost of the book.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60
     \]
   - The total shipping cost is the sum of the cost per pound and the cost per mile.
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund Milly will receive:**
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund} = 75\% \times \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The net loss is the cost of the book minus the refund, plus the shipping cost.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = \$32 - \$24 + \$3.00 = \$11.00

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to consider the time she spends on each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Weekly recording time = 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
   - Monthly recording time = 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 288 minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Weekly writing time = 2 hours = 120 minutes.
   - Monthly writing time = 120 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 480 minutes.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Weekly makeup time = 15 minutes/day * 6 days = 90 minutes.
   - Monthly makeup time = 90 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 360 minutes.

Now, we sum up all the time spent on these activities in a month:

- Total monthly time = Recording time + Writing time + Makeup time
- Total monthly time = 288 minutes + 480 minutes + 360 minutes = 1128 minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks."
"To calculate the total cost for Angela, we need to break down the charges:

1. The base installation cost includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, which is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, which is 2 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for mirrors is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
3. Angela needs 2 chandeliers, which is 1 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for chandeliers is 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.
4. Angela needs 20 pictures, which is 10 more than the base installation includes. So, the additional cost for pictures is 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these costs together:

- Base installation cost: $129.00
- Additional cost for mirrors: $30.00
- Additional cost for chandeliers: $15.00
- Additional cost for pictures: $150.00

"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain in feet, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high (12 inches * 4).
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high (48 inches * 10).

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high."
"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. 

For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

After resting, he travels for another 6 hours:
\[ 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of his journey:
\[ 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to find out how long it will take the turtles to cross the highway.

1. Let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \) and the speed of each kangaroo as \( S \).

2. Since 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed \( S \) take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can write the equation for the total distance \( D \) as:
   \[
   D = 3 \times S \times 18
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   D = 54S
   \]

3. Now, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{S}{2} \).

4. We need to find out how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at \( \frac{S}{2} \), to cross the same distance \( D \). Let's denote the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway as \( T \). The equation for the distance \( D \) in terms of the turtles' speed and time is:
   \[
   D = 4 \times \frac{S}{2} \times T
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   D = 2S \times T
   \]

5. Since we know \( D = 54S \), we can substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   54S = 2S \times T
   \]

6. Solving for \( T \), we divide both sides by \( 2S \):
   \[
   T = \frac{54S}{2S} = 27
   \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

"Kora made 20 dishes.

Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory makes:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada makes:
2 * 40 (Rory's dishes) = 80 dishes.

Together, they make:
20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The cost of the new laptop is $600.
2. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has been paid $150 this week.
4. Her mom agrees to give her $80.
5. Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total, including the money in her purse, and how much she needs to reach the total cost of the laptop.

The total amount Erika needs to buy the laptop is $400. She still needs $50, which means she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

Now, let's account for the money she has from her job and her mom:
- Money from her job: $150
- Money from her mom: $80

So, the total amount from her job and her mom is $150 + $80 = $230.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. Therefore, the equation to find \( x \) is:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

"Adam starts with 3 large apples and 5 small apples. 

Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield:
3 large apples * 5 slices per large apple = 15 slices

Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield:
5 small apples * 3 slices per small apple = 15 slices

In total, Adam has:
15 slices from large apples + 15 slices from small apples = 30 slices

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. Therefore, with 3 cows, he extracts:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters a day, the number of additional cows needed is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of the glue that is left in each of the three glue sticks and then sum these lengths.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left. Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left. The length of the glue that is not used is:
   \[
   12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the lengths of the glue that is not used from all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}

"To find out how many students are good at math, we need to consider the students who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English.

- 5 students are good at math only.
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects. We know there are 20 students in total and 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only. So, the number of students who are good at both subjects is:

20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 students good at both.

Now, to find the total number of students good at math, we add those who are good at math only to those who are good at both:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time each group takes and then see how many such time slots fit into the total concert duration, including the intermission.

Each group's performance time is:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

So, the total time for each group is:
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is:
2 * 60 = 120 minutes

However, there is a 10-minute intermission, so the actual time available for the groups to perform is:
120 - 10 = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:
110 / 10 = 11

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11

11 groups can perform in the concert."
"To calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest, we first need to determine the annual interest earned and then apply it over the 3-year period.

The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is $300. So, the annual interest rate is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \]

This means Brenda earns $225 in interest each year.

Over 3 years, the total interest earned will be:

\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add this total interest to the original amount to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $975."
"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 40 white shirts, and half of them have collars. So, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

Now, to find how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons:

\( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

2. Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so each basket of red food now costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
   - Therefore, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( I = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( I = S + 2 \) or \( S = I - 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( I + B + S + M = 87 \).

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( I \), \( S \), and \( M \) in terms of \( B \) into the sum equation:

"Let's denote the number of books Fawn has as \( F \), Anne has as \( A \), and Sofie has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \)
2. \( S = A + 25 \)
3. \( A = F - 12 \)

First, we can substitute the second and third equations into the first equation to find \( F \).

From the third equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
\[ A = F - 12 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ S = A + 25 \]
Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into this equation, we get:
\[ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \]

Now we substitute \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling those chickens.
3. Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Isaias has 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = 300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180 \]

Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling those chickens.
The selling price per chicken is $50.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Step 3: Subtract the profit from the total revenue to find the cost of the chickens.
Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000.
\[ \text{Cost of the chickens} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for sale for a total of $7000."
"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we can find out how many glasses Micah sold by first determining how many glasses Mitchell sold.

The total sold by Julie and the boys is 32, and Julie sold 14, so the boys together sold:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \text{ glasses} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
2. Determine the cost of the new rope.
3. Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Sarah will get from selling the rope.
- The rope is 20 meters long.
- The price per meter is $2.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Sarah will get is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

Step 2: Determine the cost of the new rope.
- The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
- Since Sarah is buying a rope of the same length (20 meters), the cost of the new rope is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$1.5/\text{meter} = \$30\).

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the new rope from the money Sarah gets from selling the rope.
- The money Sarah has after selling the rope is $40.
- The cost of the new rope is $30.
- Therefore, the money Sarah will have left over is \( \$40 - \$30 = \$10 \).

"Let's denote Melanie's current age as \( x \).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Let's denote the number of years from now when her age will be 24 as \( y \). So, we can write the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

"First, let's calculate the cost of each item category:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Since she has 3 packs, the total cost for strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, the cost per pack of apples is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
10 \text{ (bacon)} + 24 \text{ (chicken)} + 12 \text{ (strawberries)} + 14 \text{ (apples)} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime is 65 minutes. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

"To determine how much material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can calculate the material needed for each type of mask separately and then sum the totals.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 small mask, she needs \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\) yards of material.
- For 20 small masks, she would need \(20 \times 0.5 = 10\) yards of material.

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, to make 1 large mask, she needs \(\frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75\) yards of material.
- For 8 large masks, she would need \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) yards of material.

Now, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:

"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres. Adding 100 acres to that gives \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres for Farmer Smith's farm.

Together, the two farms have \(200 + 500 = 700\) acres.

700 acres"
"Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.

He gets paid $0.20 for every package, so for 40 packages, he earns 40 * $0.20 = $8.00 per hour.

In an eight-hour workday, he would earn 8 * $8.00 = $64.00.

Therefore, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday."
"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. 

A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 4 * 45 = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to calculate how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since 180 minutes is 360 half-hours (180 / 0.5 = 360), John would drink 360 bottles of water in that time.

Final numerical answer:
360"
"Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

The equation representing the total number of pieces of bologna can be written as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides to solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

Final numerical answer:
6"
"Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so he drives a total of:

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles per tune-up:

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.

3 tune-ups"
"Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

In all these three days, Bruce works \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons would be:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each would cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, the total amount they had together is $28. Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total by 2 to find out how much each girl was given:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14."
"Kira initially bought:
- 3 apples
- 5 bananas
- 6 oranges

Total pieces of fruit = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces

Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.

So, the number of pieces left = 14 - 2 = 12 pieces

12 pieces are left."
"There are 6 students playing tennis. Twice that number are playing volleyball, which means there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball.

For soccer, there are 16 boys and 22 girls, which totals 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Adding all the students together, we get:
6 (tennis) + 12 (volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students in total.

"To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   = 30 students × 10 lollipops/student
   = 300 lollipops

2. Total revenue from selling the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.8/lollypop
   = $240

3. Total cost of buying the lollipops = Total number of lollipops sold × Buying price per lollypop
   = 300 lollipops × $0.5/lollypop
   = $150

4. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   = $240 - $150
   = $90

The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(21 \div 3 = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

Therefore, Larry has 47 pets."
"Abby eats 2 slices a day. Josh eats twice as much as Abby, which means Josh eats 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

The loaf of bread has 24 slices.

To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat per day:

24 slices ÷ 6 slices/day = 4 days

The loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years, starting from her 5th birthday. She collects one shell every month. 

To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the number of years she has been collecting (5 years) and multiply by 12 months per year:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since she collects one shell each month, by her 10th birthday, she will have collected:

60 shells

"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row has:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Since there are 9 cups in each row, and the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal, we divide the 9 cups in each row by 2:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, there are 4.5 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Calculate the number of berries picked per trip.

First, we know that each trip (down, pick berries, and back up) takes 4 hours. In 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth needs to pick per trip to collect 24 berries in total. Since the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"First, let's determine the amount of water in the tank after Anthony and his father fill it. The pool has 10,000 gallons of water, and they fill the tank with half of that amount:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much water is used from the tank over 6 days. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so over 6 days, the total amount of water used is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we subtract the amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find the remaining amount of water:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank."

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the calories in one mini cinnamon roll.
2. Calculate the calories in one mini blueberry muffin.
3. Calculate the total calories for all the mini cinnamon rolls.
4. Calculate the total calories for all the mini blueberry muffins.
5. Add the total calories from both types of pastries to get the final answer.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll:
   \[
   \text{Calories in one mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin:
   \[
   \text{Calories in one mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls. The total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls are:
   \[
   \text{Total calories for mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins. The total calories for the mini blueberry muffins are:
   \[
   \text{Total calories for mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories}

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs each day.
3. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
4. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of Junebugs removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these together:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we need to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day. There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday), so we divide the total by 5:

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60."
"The bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it covers is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
The tower of stacking rings has 9 rings.
The total number of toys is 62.

Let's add up the known quantities:

31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (stacking rings) = 48

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of toys:

62 (total toys) - 48 (known toys) = 14

So, the tube of bouncy balls contains 14 bouncy balls."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: \( P + Pa + J = 100 \).
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean: \( Pa = J + 10 \).
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age: \( P = Pa + J \).

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now that we have \( J \), we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years.

"Maria invited 4 friends, and each received 2 water balloons initially. So, that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons.

Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. So, that's 4 friends * 3 balloons + 1 balloon for Maria = 12 + 1 = 13 additional balloons.

Adding the initial balloons to the additional balloons gives us the total number of balloons:

8 initial balloons + 13 additional balloons = 21 total balloons.

The girls had a total of 21 balloons."
"First, let's calculate the total number of boxes donated and already owned by the charity group:

- 10 people donate 5 boxes each: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes
- They already have 10 boxes

So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes, given that each table can hold 2 boxes:

- Total boxes: 60
- Boxes per table: 2

So, the number of tables needed is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

The charity group already owns 15 tables, so the number of new tables they need is:

- Total tables needed: 30
- Tables already owned: 15

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

- Average total distance spat: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per month: 43,200
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per month: 32,400
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours.

The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos. For the additional 5 hours (17 - 12 = 5), he will pay 70 pesos per hour.

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos

So, the total cost for Cameron would be:
1000 pesos (for the first 12 hours) + 350 pesos (for the additional 5 hours) = 1350 pesos

If he had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would cost 1600 pesos.

The amount Cameron would save by paying for the additional hours instead of a full 24-hour stay is:
1600 pesos (24-hour stay) - 1350 pesos (12-hour stay + additional hours) = 250 pesos

Cameron would save 250 pesos."
"Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is 10 pounds. Therefore, each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount he spent on gas:
\[ 300 \text{ dollars} - 50 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he deposits $100 in the bank:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:

10 CDs * $15/CD = $150

Now, let's apply the 40% discount:

40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

So, the discounted price for the 10 CDs is:

$150 - $60 = $90

Next, James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

5 CDs * $40/CD = $200

Now, we need to calculate how much money James was out after selling 5 of the CDs. We subtract the money he got from selling the CDs from the total discounted price:

$90 - $200 = -$110

Since the result is negative, it means James actually gained $110, not that he was out money. However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context would be interpreted as the amount he spent minus the amount he received from selling the CDs. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

$110"

   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Remaining distance:**
   The remaining distance is the total distance minus the distance already swum.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Time to swim the remaining distance:**
   James swims the remaining distance at half the original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Total time:**
   Sum up all the times.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine how many loaves Sam had last Friday.
2. Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
3. Subtract 40 from the result to find the number of loaves the bakery has.

Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we can calculate:

1. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had: \(7 \times 70 = 490\)
2. Subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\)

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

"Deanna is 26 years old.

Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is:
26 - 5 = 21 years old.

Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, so Leo’s age is:
21 * 2 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

First, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- From \( B = A + 20 \), we get \( A = B - 20 \).
- From \( B = D + 10 \), we get \( D = B - 10 \).

Now, substitute \( A \) and \( D \) in the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Add 30 to both sides:
\[ 3B = 75 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 25 \) back into the equations for \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \( 5 \) points.

Final answer:
Azibo scored 5 points."
"The book is 1.5 inches thick, and there are 100 pages per inch of thickness. Since each paper is printed on both sides, one side of a paper corresponds to one page in the book. Therefore, the number of pages in the book is:

"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time Vince spent stapling reports.
2. Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in that total time.
3. Multiply the number of 15-minute intervals by the number of reports Vince can staple in each interval.

First, let's find the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Next, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep and subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Usual Sleep Duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Sleepwalking Duration:**
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 - 2:15 = 23\) minutes.

3. **Usual Wake-Up Time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - On this day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier, so her wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

4. **Actual Sleep Duration:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is the actual time Kim was asleep.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours, which is 480 minutes.
   - From 6 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
   - Total actual sleep duration: \(480 + 55 = 535\) minutes.

5. **Subtract Sleepwalking Time:**
   - Total sleep duration: 535 minutes.
   - Sleepwalking duration: 23 minutes.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups.

First, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:
\[ \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

Next, Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons:
\[ \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:
\[ \text{Total utensils} = \text{Number of measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. 

First, calculate the number of occupied beds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds} \]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds} \]

Next, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients} \]

Assuming these new patients are all admitted and there are enough unoccupied beds, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks will be:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds} \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds} \]

"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the remainder is:

16 - 7 = 9 emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are to family, so the number of emails to family is:

(2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

The other emails, which are not to family, are:

9 - 6 = 3 emails.

One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, so the number of emails to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) * 3 = 1 email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.

\[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"If Courtney reported 48 people and Kelly said that Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we can calculate the actual number of people who attended the concert.

Let's denote the actual number of people who attended the concert as \( x \).

According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%). This can be written as:
\[ 48 = 1.2x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.

Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls carried by each of them:

\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

The problem states that if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey would have carried 1 ball (since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey), and Jordan would have carried 4 balls (twice as many as Jason). Therefore, the total number of balls would be:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total number of balls is \( 7J \) and we know that \( 7J = 7 \), we can solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 1 \]

So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. The total number of balls is:

\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's first calculate the total number of holes dug and filled in by the end of the third day.

- First day: 10 holes dug
- Second day: 13 holes dug
- Third day: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes were filled in

So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) = 31 holes

The number of holes filled in by the end of the third day is 2.

Therefore, the net number of holes by the end of the third day is:
31 (total dug) - 2 (filled in) = 29 holes

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes dug. So, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is:
4 * 10 = 40 holes

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by the end of the fourth day) - 29 (total by the end of the third day) = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

"To find out how much Jen's travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of the supplies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies.
3. Add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel.

Let's start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400.

Next, we calculate the cost of the travel tickets. Since the travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we need to find 50% of $400 and add it to $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the travel tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the supplies and the travel tickets to get the total cost of travel:
\[ 400 + 600 = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so we can express the number of Pokemon caught by Stan as \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex can be expressed as \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final numerical answer:

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird flew in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{hours} \times 30 \, \text{miles/hour} = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The bird then flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 18 \, \text{miles/hour} = 36 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 22 \, \text{miles/hour} = 110 \, \text{miles}
   \]

The total distance flown southward is the sum of the first and third distances:
\[
\text{Total Southward Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

The total distance flown northward is the second distance:
\[
\text{Total Northward Distance} = \text{Distance}_2 = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is the difference between the total southward distance and the total northward distance:
\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Southward Distance} - \text{Total Northward Distance} = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[
\boxed{374}

"Greta initially made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.

At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.

When she got home, she had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.

So, before the surprise party, Greta had a total of:
12 (initial batch) + 6 (office party) + 48 (surprise party) = 66 brownies.

During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten at the surprise party) = 48 brownies.

The remaining 2 phones are at half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300 each. So, the cost for the remaining 2 phones is:
2 phones * $300/phone = $600

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the remaining 2 phones together, we get the total cost:
$1200 + $600 = $1800

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones."

"To calculate the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to determine the perimeter of the rectangular fence.

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of slats} = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. 

So, the number of boxes she kept is:
12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept in terms of the total is:
8 boxes * 1/4 = 2 boxes

This means she sold the rest of the boxes, which is:
8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:
6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The cost of the dictionary is $18.
The cost of the dinosaur book is $13.
The cost of the children's cookbook is $8.

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14, so we need to find out how much more money he needs to buy the books:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is $100.

First, we calculate 40% of the blue car's price:
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car:
Price of the red car = $100 - $40 = $60

Now, we add the prices of both cars to find the total cost:
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the red car
Total cost = $100 + $60 = $160

1. Emil is currently 19 years old.
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, we need to find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother.

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24, so his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24, so his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then the number of servings Joe has is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) servings.

Final numerical answer:
7 servings"
"First, let's find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

20% of 30 = 0.20 * 30 = 6 students

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after removing the football players:

30 - 6 = 24 students

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So we calculate:

25% of 24 = 0.25 * 24 = 6 students

Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders and band members) = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students are leaving early."
"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, then Charlie's boots are five times that size, which would be:

5 * 5 = 25

To find the average size of the shoes worn by the two, we add their sizes together and divide by 2:

(5 + 25) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15

The average size of shoe worn by the two is 15."
"To determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot (plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to find out how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which means Pat can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, Pat will spend \(\boxed{162}\) dollars at the store to fill up her flower bed."
"Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, so his brother eats:

\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels a day} \]

In a week (7 days), his brother eats:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

63"
"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
- The cost of one petunia is $3.00.
- The cost of one sweet potato vine is $2.50.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ sweet potato vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per sweet potato vine} = \$5.00 \]

The total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, Katherine will spend:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations, and then subtract that from the total amount of soil they have.

First, let's calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers.

Soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds

Next, let's calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations.

Soil for carnations = 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations
Total soil used = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. So, the remaining soil is:
Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used
Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose
Number of roses = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

Final numerical answer:
3"
"First, we need to determine how much Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. She sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 paycheck.

25% of $2,000.00 is calculated as:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Now, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, given that each pair costs $1,000.00. We divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to peel 90 shrimp:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Emily to sauté 90 shrimp:
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her \( \frac{90}{30} \times 10 = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) minutes.

Since peeling and sautéing are sequential tasks, we add the time for each task:
- Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Cooling from low setting: \(+6\) degrees
- Cooling from high setting: \(+12\) degrees
- Warming up: \(-4\) degrees

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 + 12 - 4 = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**
14 degrees"
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet.

First, we need to find out how old Bill's dad was when he saw the Comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30, and the Comet orbits every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the Comet would be 75 years later. So, Bill's dad would be:

\[ 30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we know that Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet for the first time. So, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the Comet orbits every 75 years, the time between Bill's first and second sighting of the Comet is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time is:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the number of checks for each type of payment and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, he writes:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 52 checks per year."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.
2. The second plane's 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes, so the first plane makes \(44 \times 2 = 88\) trips in one day.

Now, let's analyze the first plane's flights:

- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

So, the first plane makes:
- \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights to Greece.
- The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:
- \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

"Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60: \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Adam's trousers cost $30.
- His mother gave him $6.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:
\[6 + 12 = 18\]

To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers:
\[30 - 18 = 12\]

So, Adam had to contribute \(\boxed{12}\) dollars from his savings."
"Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \( A \), \( B \), \( H \), and \( W \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \( A = 3 \) (Akbar's age)
- \( B = 4 \) (Alessandro's age)
- The total age of the children is 20, so \( A + B + H + W = 20 \).
- Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group.

First, we can express the total age equation as:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we know that Helene's age \( H \) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene's age \( H \) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Walter collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund, which totals:

$500 + $1500 = $2000

Walter's friend then gives him $200, so the total amount collected before the lawyer's contribution is:

$2000 + $200 = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Since everyone else donated $2200, the lawyer's contribution will be:

3 * $2200 = $6600

So, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"First, let's calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:

100 guests * 15 cookies per guest = 1500 cookies

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door:

1500 cookies / 2 = 750 cookies

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, we can find the number of people in the church by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people

So, there were 50 people in the church next door."
"Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total number of slices is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

The total size of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of the sizes of all the slices. Therefore, the total size of the watermelon is \( 2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x \).

Each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2x}{8x} \times 100\% = \frac{2}{8} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on his activities and subtract that from the nine hours he has available.

1. Time spent at the clinic: 9 hours
2. Time spent on inpatients: 10 minutes per inpatient * 9 inpatients = 90 minutes = 1.5 hours
3. Time spent on appointments: 30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes = 5 hours

Now, we add up the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
1.5 hours (inpatients) + 5 hours (appointments) = 6.5 hours

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the 9 hours available:
9 hours - 6.5 hours = 2.5 hours

So, Doctor Jones will have 2.5 hours left to update his records."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to work backwards from the time she wants to serve it, which is 5:00 pm.

1. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
4. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.

Adding these times together:
10 minutes (frosting) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 30 minutes (baking) + 20 minutes (making batter) = 180 minutes

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

Now, subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm."
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, so she sold \( 3.5x \) chocolate bars.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes, so he sold \( 4.5x \) chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box."
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per session for the studio.
2. Calculate the total cost per day for the studio.
3. Calculate the total cost per week for the studio.
4. Calculate the total cost per month for the studio.

Let's start with the cost per session for the studio:
- The studio rental cost per session is $25.
- The cost per student per session is $1.50.
- With 10 students, the cost per session for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost per session for the studio is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost per day for the studio:
- The studio is rented 3 days a week.
- So, the total cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost per week for the studio:
- There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
- So, the total cost per week is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

Finally, we calculate the total cost per month for the studio:
- The total cost per month is \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:

1. Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars:
\[ 4p = 64 \]

2. Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars:
\[ 7m = 56 \]

First, we solve for \( p \) and \( m \):

\[ p = \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
\[ m = \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:

\[ p - m = 16 - 8 = 8 \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

"First, let's determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Given that the total population of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[ \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of baby porcupines born each month is:

\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of baby porcupines born in a year is:

\[ \text{Number of baby porcupines in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

The initial population of porcupines is 50, and after a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the initial population plus the number of baby porcupines born in a year:

\[ \text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Final numerical answer:
1490"
"First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is in the shape of a rectangular prism, so we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed: 55 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed: 45 miles per hour
- Time: 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
- Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so:
   \[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are over 16 years old} \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so:
   \[ \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \text{ male students are over 16 years old} \]
4. The remaining students over 16 years old are female, so:
   \[ 1500 - 375 = 1125 \text{ female students are over 16 years old} \]

5. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, so:
   \[ \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are under 16 years old} \]
6. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so:
   \[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ male students are under 16 years old} \]
7. The remaining students under 16 are female, so:
   \[ 1500 - 750 = 750 \text{ female students are under 16 years old} \]

8. To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16:
   \[ 1125 + 750 = 1875 \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is:
\[ 1875 \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - Tank's capacity = 18000 gallons.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the first day = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the first day = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Wanda on the second day = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Water filled by Ms. B on the second day = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.
   - Total water filled on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

3. **Total Water Filled:**
   - Total water filled in two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

"Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, or 0.28. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501678 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501678} \approx 0.558 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately \( 55.8\% \).

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for the car, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
2. Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.
3. Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.

**Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.**

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. If she works 40 hours a week, her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times (\$10/\text{hour} + \$15/\text{hour}) = 40 \times \$25 = \$1000 \text{ per week} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount she needs to save for the down payment.**

The car costs $10,000, and Janet wants to save 20% of this amount for a down payment. So, the down payment amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times \$10000 = \$2000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save the required amount.**

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$2000}{\$1000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet needs to work for \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save the down payment."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Jamaar has already purchased:

- 3 peaches at $0.50 each: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost of the items already purchased:

\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the amount of money he has left after his purchases is:

\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:

\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.

Final numerical answer:

"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.

First, we calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Each of the 13 packs contains 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets given to her friends is:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Since she gave these sweets equally to her 10 friends, the number of sweets each friend received is:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to apply a 5% increase to the original price each year.

Let's denote the original price of carrots as \( P_0 = \$120 \).

After the first year, the price \( P_1 \) will be:
\[ P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 \]

After the second year, the price \( P_2 \) will be:
\[ P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = 120 \times (1.05)^2 \]

After the third year, the price \( P_3 \) will be:
\[ P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \times (1.05)^2 \times 1.05 = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, let's calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):
\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

So, the price after three years is:
\[ P_3 = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is:
\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total and divided them equally into 8 albums. So, each album contains:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures} \]

Out of these 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. This means there are 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits, which totals to 5 albums. The remaining 3 albums must contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but we don't need to know the exact distribution of these albums to find the total number of selfies and portraits.

Since each of the 3 albums of selfies contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And since each of the 2 albums of portraits contains 9 pictures, the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   100 - 24 = 76 guests.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   76 - 15 = 61 guests.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   2 * 15 = 30 guests.
5. After the 30 guests checked in, the number of guests becomes:
   61 + 30 = 91 guests.
6. 7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the number of guests increases by 7:
   91 + 7 = 98 guests.

The final number of guests in the hotel is 98."

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \( S \) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \( L \). According to the problem, \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of small stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a small stuffed animal}) + (\text{Number of large stuffed animals} \times \text{Price of a large stuffed animal}) \]
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to find the price per sandwich for each package and then use that to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
- Price per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- The second package contains 4 sandwiches for $6.
- Price per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Cost of the package with 8 sandwiches = 8 sandwiches * $1.50 per sandwich = $12.

The final numerical answer is:

"First, let's calculate the number of red balloons that burst:

- Sally started with 25 red balloons.
- 40% of the red balloons burst, so \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \) red balloons burst.
- Therefore, \( 25 - 10 = 15 \) red balloons remained.

Next, let's calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released:

- Sally started with 12 yellow balloons.
- She released half of them, so \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \) yellow balloons were released.
- Therefore, \( 12 - 6 = 6 \) yellow balloons remained.

Now, let's consider the blue balloons:

- Sally found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.
- She added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons, so \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \) blue balloons were added.
- Therefore, she added 6 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.

Now, let's sum up the remaining balloons:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7 (unchanged)

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.5
   - If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Normal Teacher with Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.4
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6

3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets a Personal Extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher coming in: 50% or 0.5
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.6
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher for a personal extension: 20% or 0.2
   - Probability of Marcus not getting a personal extension: 80% or 0.8

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework by considering the complementary events (i.e., the probability that he does not get an extension in any of the scenarios).

- Probability of having a substitute teacher: 0.5
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving an extension: \(0.5 \times 0.4 = 0.2\)
- Probability of the normal teacher coming in, not giving an extension, and Marcus not getting a personal extension: \(0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24\)

Adding these probabilities together gives the total probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:

\[0.5 + 0.2 + 0.24 = 0.94\]

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the complement of the above probability:

\[1 - 0.94 = 0.06\]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[0.06 \times 100 = 6\%\]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim borrowed for college, the total amount of money he would have earned if he had continued working, and then determine how long it would take him to earn an equivalent amount of money after graduating.

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - He would have earned $25,000 * 4 = $100,000 over 4 years.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim would earn with a college degree:**
   - His income after graduating is tripled, so his new annual income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.
   - We need to find out how long it would take for him to earn the equivalent of the $200,000 in loans plus the $100,000 in lost income, which totals $300,000.

4. **Calculate the time needed to earn $300,000 at an annual income of $75,000:**
   - Time needed = Total amount to earn / Annual income after college
   - Time needed = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the required fabric pieces.

The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. Therefore, the dimensions of each fabric piece will be:

Length: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
Width: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:

Area of one piece = Length × Width = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

Total area = 80 square feet × 2 = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

2. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. So, we first find one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
2. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount won and lost:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.5 (third race) = $21.5
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result: $11 - $21.5 = -$10.5 (a net loss of $10.5)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.5}{3} \approx 7.17

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Xavier's initial height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the growth over the summer:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch."
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is $420."
"To calculate the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days the painters worked.
2. Calculate the total number of hours worked per day.
3. Multiply the daily hours by the number of days to get the total hours worked.
4. Divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

Let's start with step 1: The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Each painter worked for \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a day. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the number of hours each painter worked per day is:
\[ \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \]

Step 3: Now, we multiply the daily hours by the number of days to get the total hours worked by the team:
\[ 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Step 4: Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours/painter} \]

So, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work."
"Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

\[
2 \cdot 2x + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 2 \cdot 4 = 2 \cdot 19
\]

\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

The formula to calculate the value after depreciation is:
\[ \text{Value after depreciation} = \text{Initial value} \times (1 - \text{depreciation rate})^{\text{number of years}} \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's calculate the value in 2010:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 \]
\[ \text{Value in 2010} \approx 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78."
"There are 50 books in total in the library.

Half of them are written in English, so:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ English books} \]

10% of them are written in German, so:
\[ 50 \times \frac{10}{100} = 5 \text{ German books} \]

The rest are written in Spanish. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ Spanish books} \]

Final numerical answer:
20"
"Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers. The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers.

To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:

1955 kilometers - 325 kilometers = 1630 kilometers

Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she would drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Romeo boards a train with 120 people.

At the first stop, 20 more people board the train:
120 + 20 = 140 people

At the second stop, 50 people descend and twice that number (which is 100) board the train:
140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people

At the third station, 80 more people descend:
190 - 80 = 110 people

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:

Alison spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To calculate the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many tiles are needed to cover the kitchen floor.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed.
- Each tile is a square with a side length of 1ft, so the area of each tile is \(1ft \times 1ft = 1 SqFt\).
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
- Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(200 SqFt \div 1 SqFt/tile = 200 tiles\).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
- Each tile costs $12.
- The total cost is \(200 tiles \times $12/tile = $2400\).

The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor will be $2400."
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost. 

First, we calculate 60% of the normal cost:
60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
$120 + $72 = $192

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
$192 * 12 = $2,304

So, James pays $2,304 a year for his insurance."
"Greg uses 4 twin sheets and 1 king sheet per week. 

- For the twin beds: 4 sheets per bed * 4 beds = 16 twin sheets per week.
- For the king bed: 1 king sheet per week.

Since the machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time, we can calculate the number of loads per week:

- Twin sheets: 16 sheets / 2 sheets per load = 8 loads per week.
- King sheets: 1 sheet / 1 sheet per load = 1 load per week.

So, the total number of loads per week is 8 (twin) + 1 (king) = 9 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of loads per year is:

9 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 468 loads/year.

Therefore, Greg does 468 loads of laundry in a year."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday + Sunday), they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, they would watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weekends = 24 movies.

24 movies"
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 stickers, so his collection increased to:
100 (previous amount) + 50 (collected last year) = 150 stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which means:
2 * 50 (collected last year) = 100 stickers.

Adding this year's collection to his last year's total:
150 (last year's total) + 100 (collected this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats in one day and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

1. First, calculate the daily consumption of cat food for one cat:
   - Each cat is fed 60 grams twice a day.
   - So, one cat consumes \(60 \, \text{grams} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

2. Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
   - \(120 \, \text{grams} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams}\) per day.

3. Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
   - \(720 \, \text{grams} \div 360 \, \text{grams/day} = 2 \, \text{days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days."
"Becky ate 10 slices.

Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Total slices eaten: 31"
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's part as \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for the meal is the sum of both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we can find Betsy's part by adding 18 to Donovan's time:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, let's break down each charge:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's Visit**: The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge would be half of $300, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: $4/pill for 30 pills, which is $4 * 30 = $120.
4. **Parking**: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add all these charges together:

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

The total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"First, we need to determine how many emails James doesn't need to respond to each day. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80 emails:

20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't need to respond to 16 emails each day. This means he needs to respond to the remaining emails:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to 64 emails each day. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

Therefore, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week."
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:

\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:

\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

- 100 on the third test
- 80 on the fourth test

Total score = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Number of tests = 4

Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 

First, calculate how many pizzas the glee club ate:
20 pizzas * 70% = 20 * 0.70 = 14 pizzas

So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving:
20 pizzas - 14 pizzas = 6 pizzas

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so:
20 pizzas * 2 = 40 pizzas

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
40 pizzas * 80% = 40 * 0.80 = 32 pizzas

So, the football team ate 32 pizzas, leaving:
40 pizzas - 32 pizzas = 8 pizzas

Adding the remaining pizzas from both groups:
6 pizzas + 8 pizzas = 14 pizzas

Final numerical answer:
14 pizzas"
"Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. 

First, let's calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent on postage:
\[ 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar, we convert the total cost to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 245 dollars on postage."

"Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. Since he needs to make 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter he buys, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

Let's calculate the cost:

1. For the first pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
2. For the second pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
3. For the third pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
4. For the fourth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
5. For the fifth pound, he pays the full price of $4.00.
6. For the sixth pound, he gets half off, so he pays $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Now, let's add up the total cost:

$4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 + $4.00 + $2.00 = $18.00

45 - 4 = 41

The cost to rent the theater is $125, and there is an additional $6 for each additional guest beyond the initial 20. So, the number of additional guests is:

41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:

21 * $6 = $126

Adding the rental fee and the cost for the additional guests gives us the total cost:

$125 + $126 = $251

The party will cost $251."
"Let's start by calculating how much money Maggie and Riza each had initially.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has three-quarters of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times \text{Maggie's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Maggie's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie initially had $80.

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has two-thirds of her money left. Since she has $60 left, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times \text{Riza's initial money} = 60
\]

To find Riza's initial money, we solve for it:

\[
\text{Riza's initial money} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza initially had $90.

Now, let's calculate how much money each of them has left:

Maggie has $60 left, and Riza also has $60 left.

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add their remaining amounts:

\[
60 + 60 = 120

Therefore, the two of them have $120 left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for a week, so the total number of bananas eaten by the three monkeys in a week is 315.

Now, let's calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey:

- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
- Let's denote the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day as \(x\).

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can write the equation as:

\[7 \times (10 + 14 + x) = 315\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[7 \times (24 + x) = 315\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[24 + x = 45\]

Subtracting 24 from both sides:

\[x = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5 to cover the cost. The florist can only give change in quarters, and since 1 quarter is $0.25, the number of quarters she needs to make up the $5 is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

However, since she doesn't have enough money to cover the cost, she will not receive any change. Therefore, the number of quarters she leaves with is:

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

\[ 10 \, \text{toothpicks/week} \times 12 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for the sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \, \text{toothpicks} - 120 \, \text{toothpicks} = 80 \, \text{toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{toothpicks}}{10 \, \text{toothpicks/week}} = 8 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 200 toothpicks."
"First, let's calculate the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. The watch was sold at 75% of its original price, which is $2000.

The price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, the selling price to his friend is:
\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount is:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, a single spring creates 1 jellyfish.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes
   - 1 minute = 60 seconds
   - Therefore, 4 hours = 4 × 60 × 60 = 14,400 seconds

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since 1 jellyfish is created every second, in 14,400 seconds, one spring will create 14,400 jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create 5 × 14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

72,000"
"Frankie's score was 15 better than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90.

Twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\).

Frankie's score is 15 more than this, so Frankie's score is \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score: 195"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then walked back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

Since he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time it took him to walk 4 miles.

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour

It took James 1 hour to reach the store."
"To calculate how much money Jenny saved, we need to compare the cost of buying 40 bananas (10 bunches, with 4 bananas per bunch) in bunches versus buying them individually.

First, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:

- Each banana costs $0.80.
- Jenny has 40 bananas (10 bunches * 4 bananas per bunch).

Cost of 40 bananas individually:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:

- Each bunch costs $3.00.
- Jenny has 10 bunches.

Cost of 10 bunches:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Now, we can find the savings by subtracting the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

Savings:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Jenny saved \(\$2.00\) by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. 

Final numerical answer:
20"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we can first determine the growth rate per year and then apply it to the 13-year period.

The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, the growth rate per year is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 0.5 * 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 0.15 * 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: The rest, which is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. **Sum up the earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

**Final numerical answer:**
$131,250"
"The farmer makes 5 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the farmer makes a total of:

5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

The truck picks up 3 bales per hour and works for 6 hours, so the truck picks up a total of:

3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

To find out how many bales are left in the field, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:

30 bales - 18 bales = 12 bales

So, there are 12 bales of hay left in the field."
"First, let's calculate the total number of minutes John spends in classes during the weekdays.

John has 6 normal periods plus 2 extra classes, making it a total of 8 classes. Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each weekday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday. He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on these days, so:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time spent learning each week is the sum of the time spent in classes and the extra learning time:
\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 1700 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ \frac{1700 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{1700}{60} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 28.33 \text{ hours} \]"
"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Calculate the height after the first bounce.
3. Calculate the height after the second bounce.

The initial height from which the ball is dropped is 3 stories high, with each story being 24 feet. So, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

The height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Let's denote the initial weight of the Triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. This means \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms were left after the velociraptors.

3. The Allosaurus then ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the remaining \( \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

So, the Triceratops initially had 1080 kilograms of meat.

Final numerical answer:
1080"
"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, let's add the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted:

\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

\[240 \div 20 = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Finally, we calculate the cost. Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:

\[12 \times 12 = 144\]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Ellen starts with a case of 12 sodas.
2. She shakes 3 of them.
3. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas.
4. Her brother takes 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random. There are 9 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{9} \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%."
"The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the second train is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

After 3 hours, the distance covered by the first train is:
60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles

After 3 hours, the distance covered by the second train is:
30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

Final numerical answer:
270 miles"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st is 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th is 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off, so he works 80% of the days.
- Number of days Billy works = 50 days * 80% = 50 * 0.8 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of people he helps per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total number of people he helps = 40 days * 6 people/day = 240 people.

**Final Answer:**

"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

Time to slide down the biggest slide = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute

Time to slide down the second biggest slide = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract that from the initial charge:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00. The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{1}{5}J \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}J = \frac{1}{15}J \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{15}J = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve for \( J \):

\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90."

Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old."
"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for her retirement and then figure out how long it will take her to save that amount given her current savings rate.

1. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs for retirement:
   - She plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary.
   - Her current annual salary is $100,000.
   - 40% of $100,000 is \(0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000\).

2. Calculate the total amount of money needed for 20 years of retirement:
   - She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years.
   - Total amount needed = \(40,000 \times 20 = 800,000\).

3. Calculate the amount Lauren saves each year:
   - She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary.
   - 20% of $100,000 is \(0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000\).

4. Calculate the number of years needed to save $800,000:
   - She saves $20,000 per year.
   - Number of years needed = \(\frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40\).

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement."
"Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first.

1. To find the length of each of the 4 equal parts, we divide 100 cm by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long.

2. Next, each of these 25 cm parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts.

3. To find the length of each of the final 5 equal parts, we divide 25 cm by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

So, each final cut will be 5 cm long."
"Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ P = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600.

Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of the total population:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:

- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, we add these two totals together to get the overall total height of the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18\] inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[\frac{18}{6} = 3\] inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To complete her journey of 9,300 miles in the month of June, Soledad needs to determine how many miles she must hike per day.

First, we need to know the number of days in June, which is 30 days.

Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles she plans to walk each day is:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/walk} \times 2 \text{ walks/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike per day to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days. We do this by dividing the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

To find out how many more miles per day she must hike, we subtract the number of miles she plans to hike from the number of miles she needs to hike:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Anna's initial budget: $16
- Amount spent: $4
- Amount left: $2
- Number of books bought: 2
- Cost of each book: \( x \)

First, we need to find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We can do this by subtracting the amount she has left from her initial budget:

\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

So, Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 10 \]

To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, so Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, so Dior took 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours (since it's mentioned ""over 4 hours longer,"" we can assume the minimum overage is 1 hour).

Now, let's add up the time they all took to do their chores:

Amalia: 4 hours
Megan: 6 hours
Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month, and each visit involves a round trip. 

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{2 \, \text{hours}}{70 \, \text{mph}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 70 \, \text{mph} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 280 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if Sofie walks 70 miles, Brian will walk half that distance:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 60 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 120 \text{ toys} \]

The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. So, in 10 hours, each of them produces:
\[ 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ toys} \]
Since there are two such workers, the total number of toys produced by these two workers is:
\[ 40 \text{ toys} \times 2 = 80 \text{ toys} \]

Now, we add the toys produced by the first four workers:
\[ 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. This means that the total number of toys produced by the five workers is:
\[ 400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys} \]

The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker is:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, and Kory's dog is 60 pounds. So, Elijah's first dog weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and Elijah's two dogs:

\[ 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

The total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all of his stickers to Kris, so Luis had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he had were half of what he received from Seth. Therefore, Luis received \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers from Seth.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Therefore, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"First, let's calculate the total weight of M&M that John has:

3 large bags * 10 ounces per bag = 30 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many M&M he has in total:

30 ounces * 30 M&M per ounce = 900 M&M

Now, if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, we can calculate the number of small bags he can make:

900 M&M / 10 M&M per small bag = 90 small bags

Final numerical answer:
90"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Divide this distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.

"The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is:
\[ 120 \, \text{mph} \times 5 = 600 \, \text{mph} \]

The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so its speed is:
\[ 600 \, \text{mph} \times 1.25 = 750 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the faster car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age, so Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as \( A \), by Madeline as \( M \), by Camden as \( C \), and by Sarah as \( S \).

From the problem, we know the following:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know \( S = 9 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now we know:
- Arnold painted 13 eggs.
- Camden painted 21 eggs.

The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold."
"First, let's determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:

\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \, \text{crayons} \times 1 \, \text{ounce/crayon} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:

\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \, \text{boxes} \times 8 \, \text{ounces/box} = 200 \, \text{ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \, \text{ounces} + 200 \, \text{ounces} = 400 \, \text{ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \, \text{ounces}}{16 \, \text{ounces/pound}} = 25 \, \text{pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

25 pounds"
"First, let's calculate how much of the tree can be made into logs:

80% of 80 feet = 0.80 * 80 = 64 feet

Now, we need to determine how many 4-foot logs can be made from 64 feet:

64 feet / 4 feet per log = 16 logs

From each log, John can cut 5 planks:

16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

If he sells each plank for $1.2, then the total amount he makes is:

80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

So, John makes $96."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Their combined salary is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns:

\[ 15000 \times 2 = 30000 \]

The total amount of money they all have together is:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Given that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach and the beach portion of the trail is 2 miles, we can determine her speed on the beach. 

First, we calculate her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on the beach}}{\text{Time on the beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since she walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on the sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on the sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{10 \text{ minutes}}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, we get the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

"Jane has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved a total of:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save $28 is:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has. We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This means that before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. If he loses 10 marbles from his current 36 marbles, he will have:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. After mixing, the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees, which means the average temperature of the mixed water is at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug). The average temperature of the mixed water can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.

"To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens added over that period and then add them to the initial numbers.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

**Final numerical answer:**

"First, let's calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount:

Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

Now, let's apply the 10% discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Now, let's find out how many bagels Russell gets in 4 packs:
\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

Finally, to find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels:

Each single bagel will cost:
\[ \$1.00 \]"
"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - This means it takes \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes to make \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops are in 18 scoops.
   - There are \(18 \div 2 = 9\) sets of 2 scoops in 18 scoops.

4. Since each set of 2 scoops requires 3 potatoes, for 9 sets, we need \(9 \times 3 = 27\) potatoes.

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which totals to:
3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs

Then he increases it to 5 eggs a day for 30 days, which totals to:

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of men and women on the bus initially.

Given the ratio of men to women is 5:9, we can represent the number of men as \(5x\) and the number of women as \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, which is given as 84. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[14x = 84\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

- Number of men: \(5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- Number of women: \(9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\)

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34."
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales.
2. Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales.
3. Determine the number of sunflowers in each bouquet.
4. Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day.
5. Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both sunflowers and bouquets over 3 days.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day from the sunflower sales:**
   - The cost of one sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from sunflower sales per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers.

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day from the bouquet sales:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from bouquet sales per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets.

3. **Determine the number of sunflowers in each bouquet:**
   - Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets per day:**
   - Number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets = 7 * 12 = 84 sunflowers.

5. **Sum the total number of sunflowers sold from both sunflowers and bouquets over 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold from sunflower sales over 3 days = 13 * 3 = 39 sunflowers.
   - Total sunflowers sold from bouquet sales over 3 days = 84 * 3 = 252 sunflowers.
   - Total sunflowers sold over 3 days = 39 + 252 = 291 sunflowers.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is 291."
"First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100 if each rock costs $5.

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning with the second ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

First, the probability of winning with the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning with the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 

To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes:

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the original price, which means he sells each device for $40.

First, let's calculate the profit from selling one device:
\[ \text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Buying price} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the total profit from selling the 2 devices he bought on Monday:
\[ \text{Profit from Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Then, we calculate the total profit from selling the 4 devices he bought on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Profit from Tuesday} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Finally, we add the profits from both days to get the total profit:
\[ \text{Total profit} = 40 + 80 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required based on the information given.

1. Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
2. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we need 5 bottles (since 100% / 20% = 5).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required would be:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they would need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total required:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of land.

1. He sold half of the land for $50. Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters. So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. After selling 40 square meters, he has 40 square meters left. He then sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. One-fourth of 40 square meters is 10 square meters. So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. After these two sales, he has 30 square meters of land left (40 - 10 = 30).

4. He then sold the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. The total amount from selling the remaining land is 30 * $3 = $90.

5. Adding up all the money he earned: $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the third sale) = $170.

Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $170 after selling all his unused land."

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs that were found:

Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

Total found: \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs.

"First, let's calculate the number of apartments in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined total of the first two complexes. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Adding this to the 400 apartments gives us the total number of apartments in the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Now, we can find the total number of apartments in all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters, and the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope:
\[ R = 4B \]

2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation.

First, from \( B = Y - 7 \), we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters."

1. The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half the mural is yellow, so 6 pints of the paint are yellow.
3. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple.

Since the total is 12 pints and 6 pints are yellow, the remaining paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

These 6 pints are equally divided among red, white, and purple. So, each of these colors uses 6 / 3 = 2 pints of paint.

"First, let's calculate the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:

\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:

\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total area of the house is:

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so she counts \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs of clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds from Thursday, so she counts \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs of clouds.

To find the total number of clouds she counted across all five days, we add the number of clouds from each day:

At the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 is \( 100 \times 0.20 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the special box contains \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special box:**
   - The special box costs $12 and contains 120 pods.
   - The cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine how many pods you can get for $1:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. Since each bill is $20, the number of 20 dollar bills he withdraws is:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home. So, the number of bills he has left is:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, the number of bills he uses is:

   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   The amount he pays is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% of the 5-inch piece on Monday, and then calculate how many days he can use 20% of the remaining chalk before it falls below 2 inches.

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with 5 inches of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - 45% of 5 inches = \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine how much chalk is used each day:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - 20% of 2.75 inches = \(0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55\) inches.

3. **Calculate the number of days before the chalk is less than 2 inches:**
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to be less than 2 inches.
   - Let \(n\) be the number of days.
   - The chalk left after \(n\) days = \(2.75 - 0.55n\).
   - We need \(2.75 - 0.55n < 2\).

4. **Solve the inequality:**
   - \(2.75 - 0.55n < 2\)
   - \(2.75 - 2 < 0.55n\)
   - \(0.75 < 0.55n\)
   - \(n > \frac{0.75}{0.55}\)
   - \(n > 1.3636\)

Since \(n\) must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 2.

Therefore, the teacher has 2 days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7) \]

Next, we'll eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, let's isolate \( C \) by moving all terms involving \( C \) to one side and constants to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"First, let's calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices and pepperoni pizza slices that Kate's friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends, the total number of slices eaten will be:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, let's determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizzas are needed.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many whole cheese pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(36 \text{ slices} \div 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many whole pepperoni pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(24 \text{ slices} \div 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 3 \text{ pizzas}\)

2. **Snowballs Melted Per 15 Minutes**: 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, the number of snowballs that melt in an hour is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

3. **Net Snowballs Built Per Hour**: The net number of snowballs Jay builds in an hour is the number he builds minus the number that melt, which is \(20 - 8 = 12\).

4. **Snowballs Needed**: Jay needs 60 snowballs.

5. **Time Calculation**: To find out how many hours it will take to build 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net number of snowballs built per hour. So, \(60 \div 12 = 5\) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's current age given the information about John's age and their age relationship 20 years ago.

1. John is currently 28 years old.
2. 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old 20 years ago.
4. To find Jim's current age, we add 20 years to his age 20 years ago: \(4 + 20 = 24\).

So, Jim is currently 24 years old.

**Final Answer:**
24"
"Doxa ate 1 slice.
Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices they all ate, we add the slices together:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

The final numerical answer is:
6"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
   \[50 - 38 = 12\] bandages left.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used:
   \[38 - 10 = 28\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the second day, they had:
   \[12 + 50 - 28 = 34\] bandages left.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they added:
   \[2 \times 50 = 100\] bandages to their stock. They also used half a pack, which is:
   \[0.5 \times 50 = 25\] bandages. Therefore, at the end of the third day, they had:
   \[34 + 100 - 25 = 109\] bandages.

However, the problem states that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our initial stock to match this condition. Let's denote the initial number of bandages as \(x\). Then, the equation for the end of the third day would be:
\[x + 50 - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + 100 - 66 + 100 - 25 = 78\]
\[x + 109 - 66 = 78\]
\[x + 43 = 78\]
\[x = 78 - 43\]
\[x = 35\]

So, they started with 35 bandages on the first day.

Final numerical answer:
35"
"To calculate the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to consider both the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut based on the difference in hair length.

1. The cost of the color is $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so the difference in length is 10 - 8 = 2 inches.
3. The cost for the haircut is 2 inches * $30 per inch = $60.

Adding the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut together:

$40 (color) + $60 (cut) = $100

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days Jen works in April.**

Since there are 4 weeks in April and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times \$11.25/\text{day} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Add the additional $10 for complete attendance.**

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives the additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$270 + \$10 = \$280 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[ \$280 \]"
"To calculate how much money Jason earned, we need to multiply the number of times he performed each task by the amount he earns for that task and then sum up all the amounts.

- For doing his laundry: $3.00 × 1 = $3.00
- For cleaning his room: $1.50 × 1 = $1.50
- For taking the trash to the curb: $0.75 × 2 = $1.50
- For emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 × 6 = $3.00

Now, we add all these amounts together:

"Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

If there are ten sharks, then the total amount of blood in ten sharks is:

\[ 120 \text{ gallons/shark} \times 10 \text{ sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

The number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons."
"In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
At 10:00, 40 more people entered.
Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later, which is 2 * 40 = 80 people.
By evening, 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered, which is 3 * 50 = 150 people.

To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (later) + 150 (evening) = 320

The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 red pens

She also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens, so the number of black pens is:

2 * 25 red pens = 50 black pens

To find the total number of pens, we add the red and black pens together:

25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens

Final numerical answer:

"First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles for $600, so the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle} \]

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac. Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 2400 \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted:
- 20 White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees

On the second day, he planted:
- 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees
- 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days:
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days:
50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees

"Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:

\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"To find the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we can break down the problem into steps.

1. Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   - Number of fish with red stripes = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \).

2. Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing the fish with red stripes:
   - Remaining fish = Total fish - Fish with red stripes = 66 - 22 = 44.

3. Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes from the remaining fish:
   - Five-elevenths of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \).

4. Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:
   - Total fish with red and blue stripes = Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = 22 + 20 = 42.

Final numerical answer:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amy originally had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. In total, she had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors.

Now, let's account for the changes:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, so she loses \(4\) colors from the stolen palette. Now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.
5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she uses up \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors from one of the makeup sets. So, she loses another \(3\) colors. Now she has \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

19"
"Mattison is 60 inches tall.

His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches high, the height from the first floor to the second floor (which is the same as the height of the second floor) is:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

The total miles walked by all four dogs per day is the average miles per dog multiplied by the number of dogs. So, we have:

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Average miles per dog} \times \text{Number of dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 3 \, \text{miles/dog} \times 4 \, \text{dogs} \]
\[ \text{Total miles} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we know the miles walked by the first three dogs:
- First dog: 1 mile
- Second dog: 4 miles
- Third dog: 3 miles

Adding these up gives us the total miles walked by the first three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles walked by all four dogs:
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 12 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Miles for the last dog} = 4 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The value of John's house is $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of the house value, so the loan amount is:
   \[
   250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
   \]
3. He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts, so the amount used to pay off debts is:
   \[
   100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
   \]
4. The leftover amount after paying off the debts is the loan amount minus the amount used to pay off debts:
   \[
   100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

So, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000."
"To find out how much Deandre will earn after selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught.

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To find Trinity's profit, we first need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the buying price from it.

1. Calculate the selling price:
   - Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.
   - Buying price = $72.
   - Selling price = \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \).

2. Perform the multiplication:
   - \( 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \).

3. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Selling price - Buying price.
   - Profit = $99 - $72 = $27.

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27."

"First, let's calculate the total amount Stephen needs to return, including the 2% interest.

The principal amount Stephen borrowed is $300. The interest is 2% of $300, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times \frac{2}{100} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, we need to determine how much Stephen will have paid by the end of the 11th month. He pays $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount paid in 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total paid in 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

The remaining amount that Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount minus the amount already paid:

"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans, considering the packing efficiency.
3. Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
4. Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.
5. Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.**

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall. The volume \( V \) of the jar is:
\[ V = \text{base area} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 2: Determine the effective volume that can be filled with jelly beans.**

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume \( V_{\text{eff}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{eff}} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.**

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches. The number of jelly beans \( N \) that can fit in the jar is:
\[ N = \frac{V_{\text{eff}}}{\text{volume of one jelly bean}} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of red jelly beans based on the given percentage.**

If 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans \( N_{\text{red}} \) is:
\[ N_{\text{red}} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

**Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the true number of red jelly beans.**

The true number of red jelly beans is 900. Tim's guess was 864. The difference between his guess and the true number is:
\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was \(\boxed{36}\) red jelly beans off."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the bus had 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. So, the number of people on the bus is now:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop entered again. So, the number of people who entered at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit:**
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost Increase After 5 Years:**
   - The cost of one visit increased by 150% after 5 years.
   - A 150% increase means the cost is multiplied by 2.5 (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times the original cost).
   - Therefore, the new cost of one visit after 5 years is \(2 \times 2.5 = 5\) dollars.

3. **Number of Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - For the first 5 years, she visited the museum \(5 \times 3 = 15\) times.
   - For the next 3 years, she visited the museum \(3 \times 3 = 9\) times.

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit was $2, so the total cost for 15 visits is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars.
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit was $5, so the total cost for 9 visits is \(9 \times 5 = 45\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(30 + 45 = 75\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount Ali has to pay John:
$80 + $20 = $100

Ali has to pay John $100."
"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, its length will be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet."

2. Calculate the amount of secret steakhouse seasoning required based on the amount of ground beef.

First, we know that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to make 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply 5 by 2:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total width of the windows.
2. Multiply the total width by 2 to find out how much fabric is needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the windows.
- There are 5 windows.
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- Total width = 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.

Step 2: Multiply the total width by 2.
- Fabric needed = 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.

Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining minutes.

1. Cost for the first 16 minutes:
   - $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes
   - Total cost for the first 16 minutes = 16 minutes * $0.25/minute = $4.00

2. Cost for the remaining minutes:
   - The call is 36 minutes in total, so the remaining minutes are 36 - 16 = 20 minutes
   - $0.20 per minute for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost for the remaining 20 minutes = 20 minutes * $0.20/minute = $4.00

3. Total cost for the 36-minute call:
   - Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes
   - Total cost = $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

The total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"Twice the amount of rain on Monday is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Carly's class has five people, and each person gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"A basic manicure starts at $35 and a pedicure starts at $40. 

First, let's calculate the total cost before the discount:
- Manicure: $35
- Pedicure: $40
- Total before discount: $35 + $40 = $75

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both a manicure and a pedicure. So, we need to calculate 20% of $75 and subtract it from the total:
- 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Total after discount: $75 - $15 = $60

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 nails on each hand, so that's 20 nails in total:
- Cost of nail art per nail: $3
- Total cost for nail art: 20 * $3 = $60

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the total after the discount:
- Total cost: $60 (after discount) + $60 (nail art) = $120

So, Karen would pay $120 in all."
"To find out how many magazines Susan gets every year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all the magazines and then determine the number of magazines based on the total issues.

1. For the 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year each:
   \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues

2. For the 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year:
   \(6\) issues

3. For the last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine:
   \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues

Now, we add up all the issues:
\(36 + 6 + 24 = 66\) issues

Since each magazine sends a certain number of issues, the total number of magazines is the total number of issues divided by the number of issues per magazine. However, the question asks for the total number of magazines, not the number of issues per magazine. So, we need to consider the number of magazines individually:

- 3 magazines with 12 issues each
- 1 magazine with 6 issues
- 1 magazine with 24 issues

Therefore, the total number of magazines is:
\(3 + 1 + 1 = 5\)

Final numerical answer:
5"
"Given that Samantha has 27 paintings and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can determine the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find the number of paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has:

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings."
"In November, the toy was priced at $40.

In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]
So, the new price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the discounted price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]
So, the price in January after the discount is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. For veteran lessons, he reduces his rate by 25%. 

First, let's calculate the reduced rate for veteran lessons:
25% of $80 = 0.25 * $80 = $20

So, the reduced rate is:
$80 - $20 = $60 per hour for veteran lessons.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:

For the 4 standard lessons:
4 hours * $80/hour = $320

For the 2 veteran lessons:
2 hours * $60/hour = $120

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day:
$320 + $120 = $440

The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440."

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had.

1/4 of 20 is calculated as:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Eve gave away 15 pomelos."
"Walter initially bought 60 apples.

1. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he ate 24 apples.

2. The remaining apples after eating are:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, he gave his sister 9 apples.

4. The remaining apples after giving some to his sister are:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Therefore, Walter received $81."
"Let's denote the number of novels Regina has written this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she has written this year. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12
\]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Since Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day (excluding any stops), the total travel time in 3 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the total distance Michael travels in 72 hours:

\[ 72 \text{ hours} \times 50 \text{ km/hr} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the 6000 km distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered. We do this by dividing the distance Michael has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"Madeline ate 6 grapes.

Her brother used 5 times as many grapes to make the grape juice, so he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.

The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.

The mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. So, the mother used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes for the pies.

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies, which is \(36 + 48 = 84\) grapes.

**Final numerical answer:**

"To find out how many teachers were at school that day, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of sick teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers at school = Total number of teachers - Number of sick teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers at school = 69 + 9
Teachers at school = 78

So, 78 teachers were at school that day."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Pasta:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta per week.
   - The cost of one box of pasta is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost of pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese:**
   - Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese per week.

3. **Cost of Gruyere Cheese:**
   - Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese per week is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs for one week:
     \[
     1.00 \text{ (pasta)} + 3.00 \text{ (cheddar cheese)} + 6.00 \text{ (gruyere cheese)} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Annual Cost:**
   - Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
     \[
     10.00 \text{ dollars/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 520.00 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.
2. Determine the total available time over the 5 days.
3. Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.
4. Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms.**

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so for 80 classrooms:
\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total available time over the 5 days.**

An 8-hour day is equivalent to:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Over 5 days, the total available time is:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time spent cleaning per day.**

The total time required to clean all classrooms is 1200 minutes, and this needs to be done over 5 days, so the average time spent cleaning per day is:
\[ \frac{1200 \text{ minutes}}{5 \text{ days}} = 240 \text{ minutes/day} \]

**Step 4: Find the percentage of the day spent cleaning.**

The percentage of the day spent cleaning is calculated by dividing the average time spent cleaning per day by the total available time per day, and then multiplying by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{240 \text{ minutes/day}}{480 \text{ minutes/day}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the percentage of their day, on average, spent cleaning classrooms is:
\[ 50\% \]"
"Let's break down the information given:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's calculate the total number of books that one bookcase can hold:

- Middle shelves: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books
- Bottom shelf: \(20\) books
- Top shelf: \(15\) books

Total books per bookcase: \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books one bookcase can hold:

\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs that Rose bought.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's determine how many eggs Rose has in total. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats} \]

Of the remaining 50 hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue, so:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \text{ blue hats} \]

The rest of the hats are white, so:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ white hats} \]

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats."
"Archie buys beef jerky that costs $18.00 per bag but there's a $3.00 discount, so the cost per bag is:

\[ $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00 \]

Each bag contains 30 sticks of jerky, so the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{$15.00}{30 \text{ sticks}} = $0.50 \text{ per stick} \]

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ $0.50 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

Each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.
2. Determine how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test.
3. Calculate how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test to meet the 70% requirement.

First, let's find the total number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct and the total number of questions is the sum of the questions from both tests, we have:

\[ \text{Total questions} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]
\[ \text{Questions needed to pass} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

Next, we calculate how many questions Audrey has already answered correctly on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ \text{Questions correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the total of 77 questions:

\[ \text{Questions needed on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35 \]

So, Audrey needs to get \(\boxed{35}\) questions right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade."
"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, we can write:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final numerical answer is:

"Brianna's family has 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights (one for each person).

There are 8 rooms in the house, and for each room, there are 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights

In total, combining the flashlights for the people and the rooms, they have:
4 (personal) + 16 (rooms) = 20 flashlights

For the candles, half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is 4 rooms.

For the 4 rooms with small candles:
4 rooms * 4 small candles/room = 16 small candles

For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
4 rooms * 5 medium candles/room = 20 medium candles

In total, they have:
16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles

So, when the lights go out, Brianna's family is using:
20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 candles and flashlights

"John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. 

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so:
- Second side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes
- Third side: 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes

The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first side, so:
- Fourth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes

The sixth side is not specified, but since all 6 sides are required to have the Rubik's cube solved, we can assume it takes the same time as the first side, which is 5 minutes.

Adding all these times together:
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 5 = 35 minutes

The Rubik's cube takes 35 minutes."
"Given that there were 20 helmets, we can determine the number of robots and footballs based on the information provided.

   - Plants needing 1 cup: 8
   - Plants needing a quarter of a cup: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)
   - Each plant needs 0.25 cups of water.
   - Total water for these plants: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

4. **Total water needed:**
   - Sum of water for all plants: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"To return home, Phineas will need to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home."
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Popsicles come 8 to a box. 

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs:
\[ \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for 7 boxes is:
\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project."
"The main phone plan costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone.

Let's denote the cost of each additional phone as \( x \).

Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we have:
\[ 20 = 2x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

So, each additional phone costs $10.

There are four additional phones, so the total cost for the additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones gives us the total cost of the whole phone plan:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

The whole phone plan costs $60."
"Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since there are 12 doughnuts in a dozen, he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts daily.

June typically has 30 days. So, in June, he makes 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

If he sells each doughnut for $2, then the total money he makes in June is 3600 * $2 = $7200.

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts."
"Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day. So, the number of photos she uploads each day is:

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

To find out how many days she will need to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos."
"To calculate the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we need to first determine the cost for one week and then multiply that by 5.

For one week:
- Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 per blouse = $25.00
- Pants: 2 pairs of pants * $8.00 per pair = $16.00
- Skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 per skirt = $6.00

Total for one week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Now, for 5 weeks:
Total for 5 weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"First, let's calculate John's new speaking speed after training. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and he has trained to be 2.5 times faster:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words he needs to speak. There are 10 pages, and each page has 450 words:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it would take him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time \( t \) in minutes can be found by dividing the total number of words by his speaking speed:

\[ t = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so:
50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so:
2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of people he saw on these days is:
4 * 60 = 240 people.

Now, to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:
50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (remaining days) = 500 people.

Total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week:
500 people."
"Let's break down the popping process step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds:** 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds:** The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Following 30 seconds:** The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds:** The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up the number of kernels that popped in the first four 30-second intervals:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\]

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, a quarter of 40 kernels pop:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\]

Adding these to the previous total:
\[200 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[
\boxed{210}
\]"
"To make 4 gallons of lemonade, Tim needs 4 gallons * 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

For the extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart, he will need 2 * 1 cup of lemon juice = 2 cups of lemon juice.

In total, Tim needs 4 cups + 2 cups = 6 cups of lemon juice.

Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 6 cups of juice, Tim will need 6 * 6 lemons = 36 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons."
"To find out how many kilograms of dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the daily food consumption for the German Shepherds.
2. Calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs.
3. Add the daily food consumption of both types of dogs to get the total daily food consumption.
4. Multiply the total daily food consumption by 7 to get the weekly food consumption.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Daily food consumption for German Shepherds:
   - 3 German Shepherds * 5 kg per German Shepherd = 15 kg per day

2. Daily food consumption for Bulldogs:
   - 2 Bulldogs * 3 kg per Bulldog = 6 kg per day

3. Total daily food consumption:
   - 15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg per day

4. Weekly food consumption:
   - 21 kg per day * 7 days = 147 kg per week

Therefore, the Kennel house will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."

"Let's break down the information given:

- There are 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- Let the number of red blocks be \(R\).

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Now, we can solve for \(R\):

\[4 + 8 + R = 32\]
\[12 + R = 32\]
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance from his starting point.

1. Calculate the distance traveled west:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. Calculate the distance traveled east:
   - Speed = 18 mph
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. Determine the net distance from the starting point:
   - Distance traveled west = 90 miles
   - Distance traveled east = 144 miles
   - Net distance = Distance traveled east - Distance traveled west = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Elvis is now 54 miles from his house."
"To find the value of the boat after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation year by year.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - Initial value: $9000
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \)
   - Value after first year: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \)

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the second year: $6300
   - Depreciation rate: 30%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \)
   - Value after second year: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \)

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - Value at the start of the third year: $4410
   - Depreciation rate: 20%
   - Depreciation amount: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \)
   - Value after third year: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \)

The boat is worth $3528 after the three years."
"To find the number of pink candies, let's first determine the number of each type of candy in the bag.

1. Red candies: 54
2. Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so \(2 \times 54 = 108\)
3. Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\)

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately, and then add them together.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen booked a hotel for 3 nights.

   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Travel Cost:**
   - Helen rode the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(80 \times 0.10 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus travel cost.
   - Total cost = Hotel cost + Bus travel cost = \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

Therefore, Helen paid a total of **296 dollars** for the hotel and bus travels during that trip."
"Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4, which means Dallas originally received \(21 + 4 = 25\) marbles from Mazie.

"First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add all the weights together:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds."

"To calculate the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.
2. Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's start with the cost of ingredients for one jar:

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Now, calculate the total cost for 10 jars:

Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars:

Total revenue = 10 * $50 = $500

Finally, calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $500 - $440 = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25. Justin has 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10. Justin has 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}

4. **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01. Justin has 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the values of all the coins:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total dollar amount in the jar is:
\[
31 \text{ dollars}

"Janet spends $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for two movie tickets, and $8.50 on a bracelet. Let's calculate her total spending first:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 × 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Total spending = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Now, if her parents gave her $40, we subtract her total spending from this amount to find out how much she has left:

$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh is open 5 days a week (Monday through Saturday). In 2 weeks, he would be open for \(5 \times 2 = 10\) days.

He services 3 cars a day, so in 10 days, he services \(3 \times 10 = 30\) cars.

He gets paid $4 per car, so for 30 cars, he makes \(30 \times 4 = 120\) dollars.

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Randy has:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor:
   - 1 oatmeal cookie
   - 1 chocolate chip cookie
   - 1 sugar cookie

   After this, he has:
   - 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

3. He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

5. He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner:
   - 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
   - 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
   - 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

Total number of cookies = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23

Final numerical answer:

"Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He would sell half of his collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

Half of 12 is 6, so he would sell 6 toy soldiers at $5 each and 6 toy soldiers at $7 each.

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $5 each is:
6 * $5 = $30

The money earned from selling 6 toy soldiers at $7 each is:
6 * $7 = $42

The total money earned would be:
$30 + $42 = $72

Matthew would earn $72."
"Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night. So, the net reduction in the number of holes each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/night} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net reduction per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Final numerical answer:
4 weeks"
"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the average enrollment at Butler High School.
2. Subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.

First, we know that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School. Since Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

\[ \text{Butler High School's enrollment} = 3000 \]

Now, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

Total cookies = 7995
Rainbow cookies = 2595
Oatmeal cookies = 3075

Chocolate chip cookies = Total cookies - Rainbow cookies - Oatmeal cookies

Let's do the math:

Chocolate chip cookies = 7995 - 2595 - 3075

Now, subtracting step by step:

7995 - 2595 = 5400
5400 - 3075 = 2325

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor placed on the lab bench is \( 7 - x \).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. So, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 8 + 16 + 7 - x = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.

The final numerical answer is:

"Alexandra raises $430.
Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.

Sarah raises $300.
Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total amount of money they all raised, we add up the amounts:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

The total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
2. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.
3. Vanessa ran 4 miles.
4. Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

First, we need to determine how far Aaron ran. Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = \frac{\text{Distance Vanessa ran}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know Aaron's speed. Since Aaron completed 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate his speed in minutes per mile:

\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 8 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's speed:

\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa} = 4 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes per mile} = 64 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed for the 200 feet of dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total needed.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line needed.
Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Step 2: Subtract the amount of line he already has.
The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total."

"To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost price per watermelon.
2. Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per watermelon.**

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. So, the cost price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

**Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit.**

A 25% profit means the selling price is 125% of the cost price. So, the selling price per watermelon is:
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\boxed{2.00}

"Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

We know that:
1. Each chicken has 2 legs.
2. Each cow has 4 legs.
3. The total number of animals is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
